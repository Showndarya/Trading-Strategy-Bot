Stock market,investing,The stock market is a total joke…,"Up 3% yesterday, down 3% this morning. How does any of this make any sense anymore? 

Can anyone explain these wide market swings? At this point, they’re starting to seem arbitrary to me. But, then again, I’m just a passive trader trying to scrape together enough to maybe retire one day. What do I know?

Edit: I should clarify that I’ve been casually invested since 2009 and do have a bit of knowledge about the market’s historical volatility. My post is mostly just venting. 

But, what’s really been confusing me are the extremes of the market’s swings this year, as compared to others. It is not normal or typical market behavior to have a record increase one day immediately followed by a record decrease the next day. The current labor climate and supply chain issues have been ongoing for more than a year, so that shouldn’t be new news to investors. 

As a long term investor, I’ll continue to buy and weather the storm. But, again, my point is that, as I understand it, the volatility over the past year is historically anomalous and I was curious if anyone could put it into perspective for me.",1545,"\- Can anyone explain these wide market swings?

Stock market,investing,Russian Stock Market to Partially Reopen on Thursday,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-stock-market-prepares-for-an-unusual-reopening-11648023739

> Russia’s stock market is set to have a partial reopening Thursday, nearly a month after it shut down following the invasion of Ukraine. 
The challenge for Moscow is that the resumption of trading could simply send Russian stocks back into free fall. On Feb. 24, the day when President Vladimir Putin began the assault on Ukraine, the main Russian stock index tumbled 33%. While the index regained a fraction of those losses on Feb. 25—its last day of trading—that was before Western sanctions hammered the ruble and sent the country into an economic crisis.

>To limit the fallout, Moscow has turned to some heavy-handed policies. It blocked foreign investors from dumping local stocks—a move that some market participants saw as retaliation for a Western freeze on Russian central bank assets since a big chunk of the Russian market is owned by foreigners. The Russian government ordered its main sovereign-wealth fund to buy billions of dollars worth of shares. 

>The Russian stock market could ultimately look very different than it did before, with a plan under discussion to split it into separate markets for foreign and local investors, according to a person familiar with the matter.

>Russia’s central bank said Wednesday that it will allow trading of 33 shares out of 50 included in the benchmark stock index, the MOEX, on Thursday from 9:50 a.m. to 2 p.m. Moscow time. Among the companies to be traded are Gazprom PJSC and Lukoil PJSC. Bets on the fall of a stock, known as short-selling, will be banned.

>Under a policy announced by the central bank on Feb. 28, Russian brokerages aren’t allowed to let foreign clients sell securities. This will prevent foreigners from bolting for the exits as soon as the market reopens, which could be ruinous because of their outsize role in Russian stocks. International institutional investors held about three-quarters of the Russian market’s free float as of February 2020, according to Sberbank Investment Research.

>That has raised concerns that the market will be skewed by the absence of foreign investors, who accounted for nearly half of equities trading volume at the Moscow Exchange in the first half of last year.
“There will be an illusion of a working, recovering Russian stock market, even though a huge class of players in the market—foreigners—won’t have the opportunity to sell,” said Vladimir Kreyndel, CEO of ETF Consulting, a Moscow firm that advises issuers of exchange-traded funds. 

>Among the Western investors that held Russian stocks before the freeze were asset-management giants Vanguard Group and Fidelity International. Both firms have said they are reducing exposure to Russia.
Due to the freeze, foreign investors won’t have much to do when the stock market reopens. 

>But the plan under consideration by Russian officials—which is still in the discussion stages—would effectively split the country’s securities market in two, with one market for foreigners and another for local investors, the person familiar with the matter said. In this arrangement, foreign investors could sell their shares or bonds, but would face restrictions on moving the proceeds out of Russia because of capital controls that Moscow has imposed since February, the person said.

>Such a bifurcated market could result in oddities, such as the same stock having two different prices. That isn’t completely unprecedented. In China, there have long been discrepancies between shares on mainland exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen and those listed in Hong Kong.
It could also prevent further erosion of the ruble’s value. Russia’s currency has stabilized in recent sessions to trade near 104 rubles to the dollar, though it remains 22% weaker than before Russia invaded Ukraine.

>“The biggest fear is that the central bank is under sanctions and they don’t want foreign investors to sell their shares and take the ruble and buy hard currency,” said Jacob Grapengiesser, head of Eastern Europe at emerging markets fund manager East Capital.

>The Moscow Exchange said Monday that it would allow for the settlement of trades that foreign investors had placed before Feb. 28 that were still being processed. Mr. Grapengiesser said his firm had trades still awaiting settlement from the start of the war that he expects to go through soon. 

>“It’s a natural step before opening the market. You need to take care of those unsettled trades,” he said. “Things are slowly moving forward.”
Shortly after the war began, Russia’s prime minister ordered the country’s National Wealth Fund to buy up to one trillion rubles, equivalent to $9.38 billion, worth of shares this year. Analysts also expect some Russian oil companies to prop up their share prices with buyback programs.

>Local investors may buy stocks too. When Russia invaded Crimea, the MOEX fell almost 18% between mid-February and mid-March of 2014. But by the end of that year, it had rebounded more than 12% from that March low. The broad index has posted gains in all but one year since 2014. Stocks in unstable countries can also serve as hedges against inflation because locals expect companies can offset rising costs by charging higher prices.

>The government’s efforts have led some to be cautiously optimistic about the reopening. “Initially, I think there will be a moderate correction,” said Natalia Smirnova, a financial adviser in Moscow. “But I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the first day could end up with a modest increase.”

>Russia is a minnow of a financial market by global terms. In December 2021, the total market capitalization of companies listed on the Moscow Exchange was about $842 billion, according to the World Federation of Exchanges, which is just under 90% of the current value of Tesla Inc. That made the Moscow Exchange the 20th largest bourse by market cap, just above Brazil’s B3 exchange, in the WFE’s ranking of global exchanges.

>Until the war, Russia mostly attracted attention from specialist emerging-market funds and hedge funds, though it made up only a fraction of holdings for most globally minded investors. 

>MSCI Inc. said it would drop Russian stocks from its influential indexes that track emerging markets. Before the war, MSCI’s emerging market index had a 2.8% weighting for Russia. FTSE Russell has also announced plans to remove Russian stocks from its indexes. The moves will force investors whose holdings track the indexes to sell—when they can. 
Wars have led to stock-market shutdowns before, although it is unusual. The New York Stock Exchange closed for about four months when World War I broke out in 1914, the longest closure in the NYSE’s history. The Beirut Stock Exchange reopened in 1996 after a nearly 13-year shutdown caused by Lebanon’s civil war.",1074,[deleted],"For anyone thinking to buy the dip, my parents still have state obligations from 1990 to sell you","I’m curious if FINRA will remove the trading halt on Russian ADRs.

Stock market,investing,Stock Market = Compound Interest? How?,"I've heard people say ""invest in the stock market for retirement and use compound interest to grow your wealth"" and similar, right? But if a vast majority of the growth is capital growth, and not from div/int or realized capital gains, how is that compounding? Or do they mean because you keep investing, that that is the compounding part?",32,"Compound returns, not compound interest.

&#x200B;

You buy a share of VTI for $200. If it increases 10%/yr (That's the average return on the total market) then it's worth $220 after a year. Another 10% and it's $242. Another year and it's $266.2. Another year and it's $292.82. After five years it would be $322.10.

&#x200B;

So you made $20 on $200 in the first year but you made \~$30 in the fifth year. That's because you're earning the same 10%/yr but you're earning it on the original investment and everything you've gained up to that point. That is compounding.

&#x200B;

Obviously the market doesn't go up in a straight line at a steady 10%/yr. But that gives you an illustration of how it works.","Stocks don't benefit from compound interest. Interest is earned by bonds/debt.

Stocks benefit from compounding returns, because the earnings that are generated in a given year are reinvested into the business, increasing the earnings that are made in the next year, which can then be reinvested again back into the business and grow future earnings even faster, and so on.","Compounding is the 8th wonder of the world. Time is you best friend and never interrupting the compound.

Start early put in what you can and just forgot about the money, come back 25, 30, 35+ years later and be amazed. Buy a quality ETF like the S&P don’t trade individual stocks. 

Use a compound interest calculator and play around with time, annual additions, return rate etc and it’s pretty amazing what a couple extra years can do for your money. The one below is very easy to use and under stand. 

http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm

Another quick thing is the Rule of 72. Divide 72 by and interest rate and that is roughly how many years it will take to double. Divide 72 by the number of years you want to double you money and that is the rate of return you need. 

Getting wealthy is a slow and steady game and it’s very hard to beat time and compounding."
Stock market,investing,Why not just take the guaranteed 5% on High Yield Savings or T-Bills over the stock market?,"Recently I had someone review my portfolio (free work benefit to have a financial advisor with BrightPlan). I have about 50% in stock/401k/ira but lately my other 50% has been going to a high yield savings account which currently gets me 5.5% with the bonus.  

He was saying for my age that’s too risk averse. And that even 5.5% is under the annual return from the stock market. But from my pov, I get a guaranteed 5.5% that compounds monthly. Why wouldn’t I take that over the stock market at the moment?",345,"It is all a choice and neither is ""right"" or ""wrong"" for everyone.

But depending on your age and time horizon, a relatively risk-acceptable approach of the S&P500 averages far more than 5.5%. Over a long time, that adds up significantly. 

By trying to time the market, you tend to miss the best days. 

I will leave this here for some fun reading for an adjacent discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing\_the\_market\_the\_absolute\_worst\_vs\_absolute/",Because of days like today. Equities are where you make real money but you got to stay invested.,"The guaranteed fixed income is great for older people nearing retirement or people planning to make a big purchase (home, etc). 

But you gotta remember the market averages 7% over the long term. It’s not a guaranteed 7% every year, so by locking in that 5.5% you could be missing out on so much more. 

Perfect example is this year, VTI is up 16% YTD. Also all the market gains this year have come on like 10-15 days. So yes you’ve gotten risk free 5.5% but missed 10% growth (Not adjusted for inflation)."

Trading strategy,investing,"My trading strategy..,this is what works for me.","About me:

A (former) long-time investment adviser who is a very active trader. I've also worked in private equity for several years.

I'm here to share my strategy on trading and significantly increasing overall income.

I have ""rules"" that I trade by. They work for me. They're guidelines. They may or may not be for you.

I will share my trades and results. I will not discuss or offer opinions on the fundamentals of a company. I'm happy to comment (if asked) as to what trade I would enter on a company. I am not licensed to give advice.

What I do is rather simple - yet most advisers/investors know nothing about it. 

It's called covered-call writing. I'm sure many here have heard of it or used this strategy. There are various ways to implement using covered calls - I keep it as simple as possible.

Essentially - you are buying a stock, then selling the right to have the shares taken away from you at a particular price, on a specific date. For selling that right - you receive a premium (income).

My personal trading rules:

1 - Invest in companies you know, and want to be invested in. Quality companies.

2 -  Diversify industries. Banks/steel/transportation/tech/pharma etc.

3 - Hedge. I keep at least one precious metal company in my portfolio at all times.

4 - Keep your emotions in check. The market is fluid. You will be right. You will be wrong. Don't chase a stock in any direction.

5 - Use income to average down. If you are invested in several companies, not all will move in tandem. Take some of the income you've generated to average down.

6 - Sell the call option right after the purchase of shares or previous option expiry.

7 - If you use margin - only use half of what you're allowed to. Use none if you don't understand the risks.

8 - Stay short-term. The call options I sell are typically 2 to 4 weeks out. I can always by back shares if they're taken away.

9 - Be patient. Don't stare at your screen all day (unless this IS your career).

10 - Try to have an option(s) expiring every week. Generate income weekly.

I will put up a couple examples as well.",97," 1 - Invest in companies you know, and **want to be invested in**. Quality companies. 

Thank you for making this rule #1. Where I've gone wrong with covered calls in the past has been to chase yield rather than trading companies I actually wanted to own. Kids, learn from my mistakes!",You didn't mention how you choose the strike price. Isn't that a fairly important part of covered calls?,"This guy probably wasn't a very good investment advisor. The income is already accounted for in the premiums and the risk that you are taking. In the long run, theoretically, you would break even with this strategy if you were to just buy and hold. EXCEPT for the fact that covered call premium will typically be taxed at a higher rate than long term gains. 

This isn't some secret cheat code for investing. The risks and the premium are priced in. 

If you really want to sell covered calls, here's a potentially better strategy: Buy ETFs with deep options chains, sell monthly covered calls about 5% out of the money during times of high volatility. You'll still capture about 92% of the upside while generating 100-150bps per month in premium. Meanwhile, ETFs allow you to stay diversified. SPY, MDY, IWM, EFA, EEM, AGG."

I really just wanted to see what everyone thinks of my analysis.

**Signals**

Strategy: Buy when a stock has reached a new 10 day low and is trading above its 50 and 200 day moving average.  Sell when the price reaches a new 10 day high, drops below the 50 day moving average, or has been open for 10 days. 

Base case: Buy a random stock at its close and hold for a random period between 1 and 10 days.

**Methodology**

The program begins by back testing a predefined set of tickers (SP500 in this case) using the buy and sell signals listed above. In order to reduce biased results I ‘walk’ through the time period, that is I fed the program a single day at a time. Each day I calculated buy signals and if the conditions were met I'd purchase the security, hold it, and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals.
Once the security was bought and sold I'd write down the trade and move onto the next day. The end result was a list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred in the predefined date range with the predefined list of tickers.

I'd sort these entries by purchase date in ascending order (oldest first) and every trade that fell on the same day was put into a list and archived in a dictionary with key-word purchaseDate. The result was a data structure I could query and pull a list of all trades that could have occurred on a specified date.

I then had all the information I needed to begin the actual back test. I began with the first possible purchase date, searched the dictionary to obtain a list of all possible trades that could have occurred on that day, chose one at random, wrote down the trade's information, and moved onto the next available purchase date.

Once all dates were exhausted I calculated an annual return by finding the product of all the year's trades. I did this 10,000 times in order to obtain the average and standard deviation of annual returns. Since my data didn't tell me which trade occurred when it was impossible for me to define the exact sequence of trades. My idea was if I got enough random trade sequences I could create a universe of possible scenarios with the most likely being the most prevalent -- it was a way for me to calculate a return and cover all my bases at the same time.",219,"You know, I backtested hundreds of moving averages, holding period dates, crossovers, technical signals, and many various combinations.  I even tried various backtests with quantifiable macro numbers like monthly ISM, and even with fundamentals likes PEs.  I've backtested a lot of these and found returns above that of an index.  When I implemented these systems, however, they do not work.  I was curve fitting and data mining.  I suspect you will find the same conclusion.",Great work. What program do you use?,"I own a quant trading shop and I tested this out in my simulation system for fun.  I expanded the universe and did some basic screening to filter out stocks that aren't liquid or easily executed.  I bought $10k per position (round lots), so you'd need about $5 million to run this at that level, assuming my liquid universe.

This indicator seemed to have worked OK until fall 2009 but hasn't worked since.  A $5 million investment in SPY would have been more profitable over the past 10 years."

Trading strategy,investing,Does this stock trading strategy have a name?,"Curious what this may be called… (besides gambling, lol)

So I have 2 stocks I like in a particular sector that have been following for a couple years… very close in price with minor variability (talking about usually 10 cents in difference in extremes).

Instead of timing price, I like to sell a majority of one stock at the higher price and buy the lower price stock for a few cents cheaper per share. This results in increasing total number of shares of stock.  Then the lower priced stock will rise to within one or two cents or higher priced stock (sometimes surpass it). I will then liquidate shares back into the other stock and rinse and repeat.

Focused on two penny stocks in the energy sector but i wonder if this is a common strategy with blue chip stocks and if so which ones?",1,"I sometimes will hear the term ""correlated pairs trade"" when discussing this sort of strategy.

If you are trading different issues from the same issuer, for example, trading a preferred against a common from the same company, that could be described as an ""arbitrage"".","This is pairs or spread trading, a type of stat arb.  99.99% of the time it works when you control the position size.  Then once in a decade or two, you get a LTCM, where the spread does not revert until you are broken.","If the stocks are correlated this is a real trading strategy, but it’s just called trading.

I downloaded the data for the last year and using this strategy would have led to two buys/sells, for a gain of 65% and 54% respectively. That’s doubling your money in one year.

I know the VIX is volatile by nature, but it seems to hit the $20 and $30 levels at least a few times a year, going back 2 years.

Easy to say, but in practice you really have to accept that for 7 days it will trend down then something like the bank debacle happens and it saves your ass.

It is gambling pure and simple but am up 26,500 this year on simple 500/1000 share buys at a time ( i have a large cash account), then sell when I hit a daily profit of 800-1200.

Today I made 4k riding it from 43.82 to 45.68. it is sooo fun when it spikes. Something about making money when everybody else is losing money tickles the senses. And it happens so fast.

It is an atrocious long term hold though, read all about contago and how it keeps buying future contracts. So my strategy likely blows up if market rallies consistently for months.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*","With options, the risks involve depend on the underlying. The underlying doesn't have to be a stock. It can be an index. And it can also be a futures contract. 

I don't trade futures, but I have considered trading options on /es and /rty futures instead of \^spx or \^rut. But with futures, you have to also deal with contango and backwardation and the strategies can get more interesting/complex. 

As for leverage - leverage on futures can be higher since margin is calculated differently using SPAN. But with options, if you are trading from a portfolio margin (not to be confused with Reg-T margin) account, you may get similar amount of leverage. 

As for losing more than 100% - it depends on the strategies being employed. For a trader that is writing option contracts, you can lose more than the initial value of the contract. For an option buyer, your max loss is limited to the value of the contracts when the position is opened. So for options, the risk characteristics are dependent on the strategies being employed.","Please stay away from futures if your asking these questions.

A future contract is exactly that, you promise to buy or sell the underlying at that price. An option contract owner has the option to choose if he/she wants to exercise or not. In an future contract both sides must fulfill their contractual obligation (to buy or to sell).

For example /es e-mini future on s&p 500 is around 4630 points right now. Every 1 point is 50$, if s&p500 tanks to 2630 its a 2000x50$= 100k loss or win (depending if long or short).

Also if it rips to 5000 its a 370x50$ = 18.5k$ move.

If you owned the option you paid the premium to choose if you want to exercise or not. If you buy a call and the underlying tanks you just loose your premium. If you buy a future contract and the underlying tanks you have to pay up (there is no choice, remember)"

This really should be a 200 level since it involves some numbers (although you won't yet need a calculator), but I'll just keep the numbering sequential for OCD sake.  On that note, I'm aiming this at people who read and understood the first two - which were brief but dense.  Also we're getting to the point where I can't generalize options as much, so note that this post (and probably the rest) is geared more towards trading options (as opposed to things like hedging, or using as synthetic instruments).  As usual corrections are welcome.


**Disclaimer:** I am writing this as an educational supplement.  My motivation for writing these has been explicitly to help fill the gap in more advanced conversations.  By no means am I encouraging anyone to trade with this information.  It's worth pointing out that in efforts to make these short and productive I've trimmed out the potentially ridiculous risk with options.  Perhaps I'll dedicate an entire post for that.



.



**EXCHANGE**

Quick note on this.  Unlike stocks which are listed in specific exchanges (like NASDAQ or NYSE), stock options are not bound to a particular exchange since they're essentially just bets.  It's worth knowing that the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, is the biggest among them (there's like 9 or so 
other ones) and is home to the all popular VIX (more on this at a later date).  But to make things simple when picking an exchange, there's usually a ""[Best](http://i.imgur.com/rreWD.png)"" choice which figures it out for you.


.


**THE MARKET**

So, it's finally time to pick some options.  Well just like stocks, the first stop is to check out the prices.  But now we're going to pay special attention to the market as well, because although market conditions play a part in stocks, they play a crucial role with options.  Also, if you're speculating on a price move, the trick is to shop around for opportunities involving **various strategies** using options and/or stocks, because there are **many ways to bet**.  Many more than just up or down, that is.  

While looking at buying options, a good rule of thumb is to make sure there's healthy (a lot of) volume.  Having a **liquid market** will make sure that there's enough buyers and sellers to get in and back out of the position with relative ease.  It's entirely possible that you buy an option and then have nobody to sell it back to (at a half-way reasonable price) when the time is right.  

This also tends to tighten up the **bid/ask spread** (remember: bid is sell price, ask is buy price).  This is another big difference with options.  Typically when buying stocks, as long as they're somewhat popular, I don't even look at the spread - in fact most popular stock ""quoters"" won't even show them.  But you'll notice that options chains rarely have a single price and instead show you the bid/ask separately.  The reason for this is that with options, pennies matter.  And the spread will consume into your profits.  

Take a look at this [chain for LVS](http://i.imgur.com/P41JM.png) with March expiration.  You'll see that there are some options with 1 cent spread (green) and others with 15 cent spreads (red).  If you were to buy options from the red circle, you're instantly losing $15 dollars PER CONTRACT not to mention commissions.  I just checked some AAPL Jan '14 calls and some of them have like a $3 spread.  That's $300.00 per contract instantly evaporated!

The 2 factors I can think of that determine liquidity are **option popularity** (some stocks don't attract options traders) and **strike price / expiration date**.  Even popular stocks lose volume if you look to far ahead or if you pick strike prices that are far from ""the money.""  

Make that 3.  **Open Interest** (or OI or Op Int).  This is a metric that you'll typically see in options chains indicating the number of ""live contracts"" which are out on the market. High OI would imply that there's high volume. The reason why volume and OI are not necessarily the same, is because in practice you can write a contract (create a new one, and adding +1 to the OI tally) and later buy it back (subtracting -1 to OI tally).  If this scenario played out in an empty market, the volume would be 2 and OI would be 0.


.



**TIMING**

Timing is everything with options.  Remember that the moment you buy an option it starts losing extrinsic value from time decay, so this is important.  As noted by [facemelt](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pnray/optionstrading_103_the_premium/c3qx7jz) in the last post, time decay is not linear.  Meaning that stocks won't lose a set amount every day until expiration.  


[Here's a graph](http://i.imgur.com/71h3M.gif) showing what the time decay looks like as dictated by the [black-scholes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes) model.  You'll notice the drop in price due to **time decay exponentially increases at 30 days from expiration**.  This doesn't mean options with less than 30 days are no good, but if you buy them it should be part of your strategy (like say, a day trade).


Another important thing to consider is recent news with the underlying stock.  Big events can temporarily dislodge prices (which you can also use in your favor, if you want).  Announced **dividends** is a big one.  For various reasons, on an ex-dividend date, call prices will go down and put prices will go up.  Another big one is **earnings** releases.  You'll notice a huge buildup in premiums (due to implied volatility) as an earnings release approaches, and then a huge drop the day after.  This affects calls and puts alike.  


.


**EDIT: STRIKE PRICE**

*Credit to [CJP84](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/psxp0/optionstrading_104_mechanics_of_buying_options/c3s00hq) for bringing this up*


*Additional observation from [complaintdepartment](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/psxp0/optionstrading_104_mechanics_of_buying_options/c3s0y54) who points out that this point becomes gray area when the strike and underlying price are close*

Another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value, because after all when the expiration day comes, that's all they're worth.  So buying an option with no intrinsic value (not ITM) has the potential to be worthless upon expiration.  

That said, they're not always bad, *depending on your strategy*.  For example, buying an OTM option is sort of like buying a house with a 100% interest mortgage (your monthly mortgage payments only go towards the interest but not towards the principal of the house).  Some people actually do this, because they believe the value of the house will go up, and they'll resell it for profit.


.


**LEVERAGE**

This is a very important concept which early options traders don't realize right away, and is the reason options can be so powerful and/or dangerous.

Options harness the power of leverage by relying on changes in price to derive their values, and *not necessarily* the price of the underlying.  For example, let's compare MCD and GRPN currently trading at $100 and $20 respectively.  If you look at their March expirations options, you'll see that the price for an at-the-money call (strike prices 100 and 20) is about $1.00 for each of them.  (And yes, I realize MCD is not quite 100 yet but if you factor out intrinsic and extrinsic values you'll end up about the same).

So for $100, you can buy a call which expires next month for either of these two companies, and you've exposed yourself to 100 shares of said company. 

Now ceteris paribus, if the price of *both* GRPN and MCD went up tomorrow by 5% the price of the MCD call would go up to around $3.50 while the price of GRPN's call would go up to around $1.50.  That's the difference between profiting $250 vs $50).  

And the reason for this is because if MCD went up by 5% it would be up $5 and if GRPN went up by 5% it would only be up by $1, and the premium only cares about **relative price movement**, and not necessarily about the underlying's value (this is a simplification).

This is also why expensive stocks like AAPL and GOOG are popular with options gamblers, because as you've already seen here they can have huge swings.  And this is also how a lot of people go broke.


*I realize I sped through this topic.  If it left you confused, ask and I'll either reply or modify the post.

**THE CHAIN**


And finally, the chain.  This is just to tie up some of these concepts and you can see what they look like in the real world.  At first it can be overwhelming when looking at options chains, but if you know what you're looking for they're not that bad.  I'm going to show you what it looks like in OptionsHouse, but most chains will be similar in nature and information.

* Purple circles - **calls** and related metrics (Bid price, Ask price, Volume and Open Interest)

* Blue circles - **puts** and related metrics (Bid price, Ask price, Volume and Open Interest)

* Green circles - **expiration date**

* Cyan circles - **strike prices**

* Yellow circles - options that are at or very **near the money**

The other numbers are for a later day.

Also, to highlight the risks involved, go back and look at the February expiration contracts still open under OI (both calls and puts) which are expiring worthless tomorrow.  If you go back and look at March's prices you'll pretty much get an idea of what those contracts were worth a month ago.  That's a lot of money lost.

Thank you. I just found out I have to have an entire book read for class on Wednesday so I'm off to Barnes and Nobles to buy it and read it. Can't wait to get to this later tonight! ,clear and easy to digest. awesome.,"> Unlike stocks which are listed in specific exchanges (like NASDAQ or NYSE), stock options are not bound to a particular exchange since they're essentially just bets. 

  Actually they are bound to particular exchange(s) similar to stock, only that they don't have a primary listing. Of course this doesn't really mean anything significant that I can think of, since probably anyone reading this  will be using a smart router and not directing their order to a particular exchange.

> Another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value, because after all when the expiration day comes, that's all they're worth.

  That's a little bit misleading, because only as we get very close to expiration do we know who is in the money. In other words, you could argue that it is more risky to buy a slightly in the money option than a slightly out of the money option because now you are risking the intrinsic value as well."
Fundamental analysis,investing,What is your fundamental analysis process?,"I feel like I'm missing out on some part of the process.  


Usually I will first screen for companies with a low P/E, companies that have just dipped, companies that some source deems undervalued etc etc.

Eventually when I find a company that seems to be undervalued I'll figure out what the company actually does, read all relevant recent news articles, have a look at their past performance, their balance sheet, the management team, and their true competitive advantage.

Then if I like it I'll do my intrinsic value calculation and buy some shares.

What is a reasonable P/E (or other metric) for the company, and why?

HFT and trading bots absolutely have not made fundamental analysis or value investment obsolete. Market makers, which are the largest chunk of the 80% figure you’ve quoted, have no clue about whether the stock price will go up or down over a 1-hour time span (but they have a good idea over a 30 second time span). They equally trade both sides of the market. Fundamental analysis and value investing targets a time range of days to months. They are not impacted much by HFTs. 


On the other hand, trading bots have made day trading obsolete. This is the activity you should not engage in. 


Case in point: our company has been in HFT since the start, and is now starting a fundamental investment vehicle for the company’s own profits, thus showing that we believe it’s not at all obsolete.","Trading bots are why you should not day trade. The bots are trained to detect and arbitrage residual patterns and short-term inefficiencies. In the ideal world, the bots would just flatten out the volatilities (i.e. inefficiencies), but often the bots also contribute to the volatility.

Because most bots don't care about fundamentals, it is precisely this fundamental information that will give you an edge over the bots over the long term.

So, why don't the bots use fundamental analysis? Automatic trading based on fundamental knowledge is hard, because fundamental analysis is difficult to do properly. Theoretically, discounted cash flow analysis should be the only tool you use, given an accurate record of core earnings and accurate projections into the future. However, the future projects are difficult to determine, and you are also estimating an absolute valuation of the company. If you make a mistake anywhere or make a bad assumption (which is very likely), your estimate could be way off.

You can also do relative valuation of a company by comparing a multiple of the stock against the multiples of comparable stocks (peers). However, in this relative valuation, you are assuming that the prices of the peers are correct. This then leads to a conundrum: if you are assuming that the prices of the peers are correct, why would you assume that the price of the stock you are analyzing is wrong?"
Fundamental analysis,investing,TSLA Tesla Evaluation - Fundamental Analysis,"Hello Investors and Gamblers! We all know what Tesla is, but do we really know what it is worth? Are you bagholding and want to know if you shall cut losses or hold it to the core of the Earth? Or are you looking for a good entry price for a heavy Call or Put slapping?

Well you came to the righ post! Here i am evaluating TSLA Fair Value for you! Hope you enjoy the reading! And don't forget to share with the community your thought and prayers! Cheers!

**Purpose**

The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the development of Tesla during the past three years, from 2019 to 2022. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration. In addition, a comparison to its main competitors and the market situation is also made. All is made to determine the fair value of the stock price and determine the investment strategy. All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company fairly valued by the market by its fundamentals?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

**Delimitations and Assumptions**

This thesis is delimited to an analysis of TSLA between the years 2019 and 2022. The thesis is based on the assumption that TSLA is the one of the most trending automotive company in the world, and that the prestige it has will support its price action in the next months.

**Methodology**

In this thesis, data from its financial statements are taken from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance and other publicly available information on the company on-line. The Company valuation is made based on:

* Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula
* Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model
* Discounted Cash Flow Model

**Hypothesis**

* US next interest rates hike of 25-50bps
* Inflation of 6.5% and cooling down to 6% for January 2023
* TSLA is high volume stock
* TSLA is overvalued
* There are many TSLA bagholders
* TSLA can’t outproduce its competitors in the near nor mid term

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Methodology

The thesis used macroeconomics data from the 13th of January 2023 for its valuations, Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Cash Flow are considered and projected to the next three years. The final price tag is obtained by the average of three valuation methodology: Graham Formula, Discounted Cash Flow and Cash Flow Evaluation. It is then given a 20% margin of error in both direction.

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, three methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

# Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 24.40%** is determined by the average analysts consensus for the company’s next year growth rate.

# Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company last year’s available cash flow data, its WACC based discount rate of 12,84% and its Growth Rate of 24,40% to determine a fair value of **$78.88** per share.

# Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing. This thesis uses the adjusted formula to better adjust it to the current market environment.

Data used for the calculation:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|EPS|3.24|
|Growth Rate|24.40|
|AAA Bond Yield|4.40|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$101.74**

# Discounted Cash Flow Model

This thesis uses Free Cash Flow, gained by subtraction Capex from Cash floe From Operations. Free cash flow (FCF) is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|WACC based discount rate|12.84%|
|Growth rate|24.40%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|Average Shares outstanding|3,157,752,000|

Which projected a FCF for the next five years as per follow:

Note: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is highly improbable due to unknown future events and variations in the market. This shall be taken only as an indicative forecast.

The calculation gives us a Fair Value of **$70.99** per share

&#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$78,88|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$101.74|
|Discounted Free Cash Flow Model|$70.99|
|**Final Price + 20% error margin**|**$104.83**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$83.87**|
|**Final Price - 20% error margin**|**$62.90**|

* 2018: 244

We can observe a 40% increase of Unit sold in 2022.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SWOT ANALYSIS

Strengths

* **Most Valuable Automotive Company**: It is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation.
* **Tesla Increased its Electric Vehicle Delivery**: In 2022 it increased its deliveries of 40% from 935 thousands  to 1.3 million units.
* **Cross-sell and Diversification**: Tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with Liberty Mutual insurance company.
* **Innovative Company**: Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.

## Weaknesses

* **Manufacturing Complications**: Tesla faces continuous launch, manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products. For example, Tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch Model X, which lead to constant delays for distribution. Similarly, the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing Model X’s battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1.
* **Unable to meet demand might affect brand value**: Due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures, Tesla’ might face an unbalanced supply and demand, unable to meet the production ramp.
* **Lack of High Volume Productio**n: It has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models. Even now, as the company plans to manufacture Model 3 vehicles at high volume, it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources.
* **Shortage of Batterie**s: The shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
* **Elon Musk as Tesla’s Sole Representative**: Musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests.
* **Financial Uncertainty**: Tesla has outstanding debt of $5.38 Billion. If the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt, then there is a risk of delaying expansion, reducing investments, selling assets, etc.
* **Employee Safety Concerns**: Tesla was recently fined in 2019 for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection. Also, the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching California’s heat.
* **Leadership Wrangles**: Friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and long-term success. Tesla’s management and board have been engaged in several power struggles.
* **Tesla Faces Lawsuit over Sexual Misconduct**: Many Tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace. The women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct. They also alleged that they were cat-called and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks, groping, and misogynistic behaviour.

## Opportunities

* **Sales expansion in untapped Market**: The most significant opportunity for the company right now is the Asian market, even tho there are increased risks.
* **Less Expensive Car**: Tesla’s Model 3 is a more affordable version of Model S with less range, power, and fewer features.
* **Bringing battery production technology in-house**: Tesla intends to make its own battery cells.
* **Market Confidence in Tesla**: The stock market has shown confidence in Tesla after beating the projected car deliveries.

## Threats

* **Product Liability Claims**: The company has faced lawsuits and claims related to the failure of technology in their products. If these liability claims continued, then Tesla may be subjected to greater financial setbacks.
* **Extensive Competition**: Tesla, Inc. faces aggressive competition from both alternative fuel vehicles (Hybrid, Plug-in hybrid, fully electric car) and self-driving technology. Many automotive brands in the luxury segment like Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and in the economy segment like Toyota, Ford, General Motors , Volvo are getting ready for a fierce competition. Many brands are not only launching or planning to launch their environment-friendly-Self-driving technology but also, they are offering them at a comparably lower price.
* **Product Defects**: Tesla’s cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases. The defective products often have weaknesses in design, manufacturing, and other features which harm the company’s image permanently.
* **Long term confidence**: Tesla, due to its unstable manufacturing conditions, suffers from disbelief among the public about its long-term existence, which can result in a deficiency in further business development.
* **Customer Adaptation**: The company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles.
* **Disruption of Supply Due to Shortage of Materials**: Tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices. The company uses aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper, and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. All these materials have volatile prices, which can affect the company’s production line severely in the future.
* **High-Risk Factor Due to Usage of Lithium-ion**: Tesla uses lithium-ion cells in their battery packs. Lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element, which increases the risk factor of our products. Tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke, which has defamed the company on a major level.
* **Elon Musk’s Behavior Affecting Tesla’s Reputation**: Tesla’s entire reputation is built upon the cult of Elon Musk. But recently, his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting Tesla.
* **Competitors increasing productions of EV Vehicles**: Competitors are jumping in the EV segment eating huge portions of the market share.

Thanks.",15,"Technical analysis is based on the fact that buying/selling happens in predictable ways.  When you combine the notions of momentum with support/resistance, you can accurately predict price movement based on buying and selling.  This is the hardest part for people to accept, that you can predict price movement.  However, once you get good at it, you become amazed that such a thing is possible.


For example, if I told you that gold is going to 1200, most people in here would laugh at me.  However, when you see that price print, you will no longer be laughing.

The reason why people using technical analysis reject fundamental analysis is because all the pieces of the fundamental puzzle are missing for the average retail investor.  


You cannot possibly account for all fundamental factors when determining fair market value of a security: currency influence, inflation/deflation, news, insider trading, etc, etc.


As to which is better, just know this - tons of people make and lose money using both technical and fundamental analysis.  Those that fail at one tend to badmouth it because they gave up.


As for me, I was using fundamental analysis but switched to purely technical and am not looking back.  It is 10x easier to see the charts for what they really are - only the result of buying and selling.


Now, I'm not saying that there aren't fundamental reasons why a price goes up and down.  However, I am saying that you don't have to know the fundamental reason why.",Technical analysis is self-fulfilling sometimes.  If everyone trades on the same technical rules then the patterns form themselves.,"Maybe I'm a dipshit. But I'm just some guy on the internet and can say whatever fuck I want. So. 

Unless you are playing around with money that you can lose and you have loads of time on your hands. Don't get caught up in fundamental vs technical (Technical btw is BS. You will lose your money eventually.) Fundamental is also very hard because you are usually looking at information that has already been accounted for by the market makers. 

Instead... learn diversified index investing and make that the majority of portfolio. Set aside 10% of your portfolio for speculation. Pick out-of-favor stocks or sectors that you think may rebound. Hold for a year minimum. Catch the upswing. If not, sell and write off the loss. "
Fundamental analysis,investing,"So how simple is fundamental analysis, really?","Believe me when I say that I'm trying to make this as simple as possible because investing is complicated already. If I'm looking at a company's book value (shareholder equity) and I'm trying to see if it's bigger than the current market cap, do I just literally look at one and then look at the other to see the difference? Do I have to crank out an equation to see if one equals the other or is it as simple as just keeping your eyes a little bit more open?

Yes, trying to figure how exactly *how* much a security is undervalued or overvalued is the goal. And none of the analytical work can really be backchecked (you really have to trust what you know and that's a problem when you have **zero** background in this stuff and **zero** business experience at all), but how much simpler can you really make this *without* losing something substantial in the analytical process?",166,"Just keep reading, keep learning and keep practicing.  If your brokerage account has access to research reports, like CFRA or Morningstar, read those (but take them with a grain of salt).  Look up some simple valuation techniques to get started.  The [Dividend Discount Model](https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/dividend-growth-model), also known as the Gordon Growth Model, is super simple to use and will give you a feel for valuing a business.  It's limited in a few ways, for example, it's only good for companies that pay a consistent or growing dividend (good news is, that's a lot of them), but you can build from there. 

As you're doing this, put some money on the line.  Buy, and hold, and then reflect on how your investment did.   What did you think the value was at the time, how has it done since, how might it keep doing in the future.  Repeat.  Buy something else.  Curious how oil and gas companies work?  Do some research and buy one, and then see how your research plays out with real money on the line.  Or how about banks?  Does reality match your expectations after you bought?

Really, have fun with it.  I like doing fundamental analysis and buying individual stocks because it's engaging for me, keeps me entertained, and there's always more to learn.","You're talking about price to book which is one of about 1000 ratios that people use to analyze stocks.  Yes this is easy to calculate but isn't enough information to tell you if the stock is a good investment or not.  Aside from this and all other quantitative measures are the qualitative aspects such as strength of the company's brand, competitive position, quality of management, etc, which are subjective and difficult to assess and analyze unless you have background and experience in business and investing.","As with most anything in Finance... the calculations aren't very complex. Even a ""complex"" 3 statement DCF model in excel uses mostly simple arithmetic. It's understanding the implicit assumptions, and this is where it becomes more of an art than science. 

If you find out the book value is greater than the market value, then that's the beginning. You don't know any more than anyone else at this point, there are people being paid tons of money to find undervalued stocks, and they have automated those types of calculations.

You need to understand WHY the market value is less than the book value, what are the implicit assumptions being made on that stock that would be causing it to be valued below book. Do you agree with those assumptions? Will the market ever figure it out? Will there be some sort of catalyst to move the stock in the direction you think? How will the company realize the value? What are the downside risks if the company doesn't realize it? Does the upside outweigh the downside?"

Technical analysis,investing,Why I am bearish on BB (technical analysis),"I'm a Software Eng. and therefore will only cover the technical aspects. As you might already see in the title, I'm bearish on BB. I decided to share my thoughts, since a lot of people (and analysts) seem to overvalue the potential growth of the stock.I want to give a quick and **very abstract** introduction on technical terms:

# Technicalities

BB's QNX is a commercial Unix-like operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market. In other words QNX can be run as a base on probably everything that is considered a computer ([IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), since it's Unix-like nature. [According to BB](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en) it powers train controls, ventilators, automation systems etc.

Why would someone use QNX? According to BB because it is [save](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications), secure, scalable and reliable. Focusing on cars (because that's what everyone talks about in this context, especially after the AWS news) a car manufacturer could implement QNX as the OS and on top of that develop everything else - for example the GUI, an app-store etc.

However some, in fact most of the biggest car manufacturers, already developed or about to develop their own OS. Why? Only they know. [It's a common problem in the IT industry](https://xkcd.com/927/).

# Contra BB (QNX):

The following car manufacturers are [the biggest in the world](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/091516/most-profitable-auto-companies-2016-tm-gm.asp):

1. Toyota
2. VW
3. Daimler
4. Ford
5. Honda
6. BMW
7. GM

&#x200B;

1. [Toyota ditched QNX](https://www.obj.ca/article/blackberry-qnx-defensive-over-loss-toyota-open-source-linux-software) for [AML](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/) (Linux).
2. [Volkswagen ditched QNX](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/) and develops [vw.os](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/06/volkswagen-with-new-software-unit.html) (Linux), which will be implemented across **all Volkswagens, Audis and Porsches**. Other car manufacturers, which are part of the VW group, that is Skoda, Seat, Lamborghini, Bugatti, **Skania, MAN** etc. are not confirmed so far, but I'm sure they will follow.
3. Daimler ditched QNX for [MBUX](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/connected/mbux-mercedes-benz-user-experience-revolution-in-the-cockpit/) (Linux). Although the t[erm MBUX seems to refer to more than just the OS](https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/At-a-glance-The-key-data-on-MBUX.xhtml?oid=32705799). every new Mercedes build since 2018 comes with MBUX instead of QNX.
4. [Ford just dropped QNX this week](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google) and will use Google's [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) instead.
5. Honda seems to stay with QNX.
6. [BMW ditched QNX](https://www.drwindows.de/news/11641-unsichtbare-dritte-marktueberblick-ueber-connected-car-betriebssysteme) and uses iDrive (Linux), although it seems that QNX is still working under the hood.
7. [GM ditched QNX](https://www.autonews.com/article/20141104/OEM06/141109954/gm-to-roll-out-android-cars-in-2016-supplier-says?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) a few years ago and uses, just like Ford, Android.

I didn't research the other car manufacturers, because the trend seems clear to me. Feel free to research them and let me know what you come up with. For anyone curious about Tesla, [it looks like they use Linux/Android.](https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/careers/search/job/embedded-softwareengineerlinuxplatforms-45034?redirect=no)

# Pro BB (QNX):

Developing an [entire os isn't as easy as developing some software](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vw-daimler-id3-software-problems/) (especially security compliance is a huge deal).

# Conclusion

In my opinion BB is overhyped. QNX is being ditched by pretty much most of the car manufacturers and the trend in the car industry [seems to be Linux, instead of Unix](https://www.pymnts.com/ecosystems/2018/ford-daimler-volvo-connected-cars/).

Furthermore I just searched through job listings for ""QNX"" and found only 16 positions across Germany and the only car manufacturer out of that pool being Daimler (still need to maintain older cars that run QNX I suppose).

Although Volkswagen had problems in the past when developing vw.os, other manufactures such as Daimler did excellent and MBUX is regarded as the best (infotainment system) there is as of right now.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/investing) if you have any questions or concerns.*","This DD sucks because it is so narrowly focused on QNX. QNX is not BB's main offering.  Look at the company from a complete perspective. 

I don't even think you fully understand from a technical point what QNX does or how it fits in the tech stack. There is an entire QNX stack that covers everything from security to entertainment.  17 OEMs are using QNX and the number is only increasing with IOT expanding. Android auto is literally built along with QNX. Car companies are coming out with their own UI & entertainment systems that run on top of QNX.

When it comes to the EV play, BB IVY & QNX will be dominant players in the industry because of the security they provide. Understand that cars are basically becoming computers with wheels. That is a dangerous, because someone can hack a car and fuck shit up. They could run it into a group of people or load it with explosives are have it auto drive into a building.   People are giving a lot of weight to QNX (due to the EV & IOT play), but they need to understand that this isn't the only reason to buy BB.

I think you (and a lot of people) are looking at this the wrong way. You really need to understand that BB is now a (cyber) security company first. The security standard for BB is the highest in the industry and it is no joke. There is a reason the G20 countries have contracts with BB. This OEM's still has a lot of power in the industry and you guy are forgetting that BB was and still is an OG player in the industry.  Here are all products/services that BB is offering besides: [BlackBerry - All Products](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/all-products)

**Unified Endpoint Manager (UEM):** An enterprise mobility management platform that provides provisional and access control over smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops with support for all major platforms including iOS, Android (including Android for Work and Samsung KNOX), BlackBerry 10, Windows 10, and Mac OS.

**Spark Suites:** Spark offers visibility and protection across all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It leverages AI, machine learning and automation to provide improved cyber threat prevention.

**SecuSUITE:** Phone application to allow employees to use work related data in personal devices without cross communication (between personal and work data).

* End to end encryption.
* Separation of concerns between personal and work data. Employers CANNOT access your personal data.
* Used by NATO; doesn't carry much value in my book but maybe in yours.

**QNX: Embedded system OS.**

* Multi-OS housing: It has the capability to allow for multiple OSs on a single chip.
* Real-time availability/software prioritization: Not all pieces of software operate on the same priority. Steering/braking would be higher priority than media, and QNX allows for that. Even if the thread/core is shared with other applications, when high priority software is requesting a resource it will be prioritized to ensure reliability.
* Resource sharing: CPU, RAM, and GPU resource sharing between different applications capability. Two applications can share the same CPU core and bump each other based on prioritization.
* Why not Linux? QNX has the highest certification for security available. Linux does not. CEOs would want to avoid liability and this certification allows for that.
* Device agnostic: It can be installed on any device, not just cars. Any IoT and offline device can use QNX.

**QNX Hypervisor:** Consolidate multiple OSs on a single SoC using virtualization

* SoC: System on a chip. Instead of using multiple ECUs, which is what car manufacturers currently do, they can use one single chip to run multiple high priority applications and multiple OSs. This is what Tesla does now.
* Virtualization: Running an OS in a virtual environment. Think Linux environment inside of Windows. This helps with debugging for developers without having to have the actual hardware.

**IVY: Scalable cloud-connected software platform for vehicles.**

* What is it a solution for? When a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the QNX/OS data safely, normalize it, and visualize it/interact with it. It also allows car manufacturers to own the data, unlike other OSs.
* Scalable: AWS servers are capable of handling the load from many endpoints.
* Software platform: There is currently no centralized software ecosystem for vehicles. IVY is providing that.
* Non-BB developers would be able to use an SDK to develop applications on IVY for infotainment/general apps/others. IVY will also use ML to gain insight on unrecognized patterns by developers. An example of this is detecting if a car slipped, without having the developer connect multiple sensors to figure out if that event happened.
* 50/50 joint effort on revenue and effort to develop the ecosystem. Using AWS's knowledge in AI/ML for calculated sensors (slip, driver on seat, etc)
* Usage by other vendors: A city can connect to the data from vehicles and detect when ice/slipping is happening. If brakes are getting overheated coming from a high elevation area. If a car had an accident, etc. An insurance company can provide an app to give discounts similar to the currently implemented OBD-2 readers. A maintenance provider can also connect to this data and check if an error is specific to maintenance, malpractice, or general misuse.

Than you got patents, major/huge lawsuits won, acquiring other security companies, decent leadership, getting out of mobile, pivoting to focus in software, decent cash inflow, etc...I hope BB will close around 20 by the end of the year. Just need a few catalysts. I think the rocket is being built right now and will blast off as soon as we get some fuel.

This DD is a bull case and put together from other bull sources pulled from other sub-reddits. Ive just been keeping up with it for a few weeks. 

Made good money during the meme phase of BB. Realized my gains, made an exit, and rebought. Still holding 500 shares of BB. I wish it never got caught up with the BANG stocks. But I am still super bullish on BB.

Update: Zach's upgraded BB to a buy and hold, with a tsrget price of $29.

https://i.redd.it/tjoxvm6rwsf61.jpg","I think you need to look at their business as a whole and not just focus on car manufacturers. 

With that being said you should investigate further on what their upcoming markets are as well as what they are collecting royalties on. These software makers trade IP like hot cakes and BB does a lot of security set ups for most all devs in the back end or offers third party management software (noted from a BB secured iPhone)."
Technical analysis,investing,Controversial opinion: Technical analysis is just astrology,"I’ve tried to learn technical analysis and the different patterns of stock charts. There’s obviously thousands of courses and online videos about this sort of thing. But it seems that almost none of these patterns can be used sustainably over long periods of time, as external news events always triumph over any chart reading. 

The conclusion I have come to is that technical analysis is no different than astrology. It’s much better to look at the fundamentals of a business and it’s growth potential than to try and guess the next stock price based on some lines on a chart. 

The only question I have is: why do so many people try to use it and why are there so many fake YouTubers and scammers who try to sell you on this stuff?",2653,">The only question I have is: why do so many people try to use it and why  
 are there so many fake YouTubers and scammers who try to sell you on   
this stuff?

My theory is they are selling a dream. I mean how awesome would it be to look at a few stocks, draw some lines and day trade, work from anywhere with an internet connection , be your own boss and rake in a lot of money?

Plus drawing lines on a graph is fun, it beats fundamental analysis  what is pouring over numbers, doing DFC analysis and WACC calculations pouring over financial statements  , also studying the industry to get a firm understanding of the industry , then investing and hoping you make a few extra percentage points then the S&P500 index , and it taking years to pay off? That shit is hard, complicated , requires math and basic finance skills

Also realize lets just say in theory I found some signal through charting that could be exploited , I would either

A. Not tell anyone about it and exploit it(once you tell people about it , it becomes a race and is no longer exploitable)

B. Try to sell it to some propitiatory trading firm for millions of dollars

I wouldn't sell it to random people for $200 bucks a pop","This isn’t controversial in the industry lol. At least the way retailers do “””technical””” analysis. 

Actual real analysis of technicals done by algorithms written by people with PhDs does happen.

But when some smoothbrain draws lines on a chart and pretends it means something, no it shouldn’t be controversial to call them out on it.

You’ll note that people who peddle this crap aren’t actually doing “technical” analysis. They aren’t defining things in a technical way. A “channel” is never defined in a technical way, such as “a stock is in a channel when it remains within 5% of it’s 50-day MA for 10 trading sessions”. Know why? Because if you actually define your analysis in such a manner it becomes easy to show it means nothing. Someone could run a quick and dirty back test and see — huh, this pattern doesn’t have predictive power. 

The general refusal of people who claim
TA works to provide a single technical that can actually be tested is damning. They claim it’s an “art form”. Well if they can’t actually define, in a purely *technical manner* what their buy and sell signals are, they aren’t really doing technical analysis.",[deleted]
Technical analysis,investing,Debate with friend on merits of technical analysis,"I have a friend who has been actively trading for two years now and he effectively blew up his account (massive underperforming SPY).

His main criteria for stock selection is looking at charts.  I’ve been telling him it’s effectively astrology and is disconnected from the underlying value. Countless studies on TA have found it to be useless and if there is signal it can’t overcome transaction costs. On top there are no known successful investors who’s primary method is TA, surely if it worked at least some would exist.

His rationale is: “No matter how much you will try to dispute the technical trading, the matter of the fact is that every institution is teaching the technical trading (fidelity, merril, etrade, tradestation, etc) that means that all the retailers AND lots and lots of finance people FOLLOW those learnings. I know that they do and attempt to consider that regardless of my beliefs, I personally can't change sh*t, but hole brunch of people that know same thing can. No, if you convince EVERYONE that technical analysis is sh*t, then my statement will be false.”

Well it’s pretty clear that technical trading is front and center from browsing the front pages of CNBC, Bloomberg and yahoo finance let alone forums like this one. 

Do I just throw my hands up at this point and write him off as someone who is delusional beyond measure and will do anything to convince himself that TA will make him money?",5,Why do you want to convince him? Is it simply a fun debate to have? If you’re genuinely concerned about his money and he isn’t listening to you that’s on him,"TA, as far as my understand takes me, was the precursor of algorithmic trading which is real and can generate some alpha, but the people developing those algorithms are generally employed by Renaissance and can’t be found on Reddit.

Using just TA to trade is essentially astrology, and retail certainly shouldn’t be doing anything but index investing for like 95% of their portfolio, but it does have its own academic merits.","It's price and volume, that's ALL technical analysis looks at. It's also a self defeating strategy because if everyone buys right at that the ""buy"" signal, that signal will cause a huge move, meaning only the very select few that got in right before the move make money. So people buy a bit early, then the big move happens earlier..... And then people buy a bit sooner, and sooner, till the point that the buy signal is no longer a buy signal because people are buying before the buy signal. 

It's how arbitrage opportunities disappear as well. They trade themselves into non existence. 

The truth is that people use TA as a way to evaluate current price movement, is money/volume flowing in or out, ie: what has happened in the past. It does not predict what will happen in the future. 

You'll have better luck trading on how chipper jpow seems to be during his talks. 

They teach these tools because they'll get engagement from numnuts who don't know any better."
Technical analysis,investing,"Why is ""does technical analysis/quantitive analysis beat buy and hold"" a question surrounded in a ton of opinion instead of facts?","It's no secret that it's extremely easy to lose money when it comes to investing. By thinking you're smarter than the average bear and doing things like:

* try to pick individual stocks that don't beat S&P when it comes to drawdown/return other than say... some of the best tech stocks of the past 10-20 years

* introducing leverage/margin into a buy and hold strategy

* trying to time the market/do things like investing in an ETF that shorts the market when you 'think' it's going down

* trying to trade options/buy calls/puts and hope that you get the timing right and sell the increase in premium/IV but instead get caught in the wrong trade and have them expire worthless/near worthless on you

* trying to trade things like commodities/forex

* trying to trade things like futures (which move $50 for 1 SPX point directionally on /ES)

* trying to draw trend lines/support/resistance/thinking you can accurately predict price movement based on patterns/history/wedges/candlestick patterns

* use one of thousands of indicators like RSI/MACD/Bollinger Bands to try and suggest good entry/exit prices

* try to make money by investing in currencies/crypto/random countries

https://www.google.com/search?q=stock+market+quant+jobs

There's obviously at least some market for ""Quantitative Algorithmic Trading Jobs""

I'm just curious, how much of this is publicly accessible? There's SPY and IVV and VOO and VTI. People eat those up and love them.

Why wouldn't people love access to an ETF that supposedly beats buy and hold through technical analysis/quantitive analysis/anything? A company offering that could potentially rake in lots of money. If the answer is ""very few of them beat buy and hold"", why is the industry as big as it is? If you google ""does technical analysis actually work"", https://www.google.com/search?q=does+technical+analysis+really+work you get a ton of articles saying... yes it does. This is contrary to what I would have thought.

I've done a bit of light skimming on research papers related to computer programming algorithmic reinforcement training, and... it's almost 50-50. 50% of them say ""no correlation was found, what we developed underperformed, stock market price movement is basically random noise"" and the other 50% said ""yep, totally possible, we beat buy and hold"".

What's the truth? I'm not looking to hear ""1 in 10 people can successfully do TA/be a day trader/beat buy and hold"". I want to hear... why isn't it agreed upon that *0* out of 10 average people can beat buy and hold? and if quant funds can beat buy and hold... where are they? are they really ""so secret"" that only people with millions can access them? My friend has $100m-$200m, he put some into something claiming to be a quant fund, it's down 30% this year...",469,">why isn't it agreed upon that 0 out of 10 average people can beat buy and hold?

Because the following things are all true:

* Some people do beat the market. Actually, lots of people and funds do.
* But that is also consistent with the 'random walk' theory, because if you have randomness you'll still get a lot of random winners.
* Approximately 100% of those winners will attribute their winning to skill rather than luck.
* Also, there have been some results (like the sustained success of some specialized quant funds) that suggest that it is possible to beat the market in such a way as to suggest genuine ability.
* So there are winners through luck, and winners through skill, and it's hard to determine which is which other than through complicated math to suggest probabilities.

Additionally, the time element is critical here. Even in cases where someone has insight that gives them an edge, that's usually going to have a limited lifespan before the market picks up on it.

This is what goes wrong with lots of TA backtesting. It's one thing to construct something that worked upon a time. But this could mean:

1. That amidst all the data & noise in the market, if you look hard enough and long enough you'll find *something* that looks like a pattern.
2. Even if you find something that represented an edge in the past, it may not be usable any more.

&#x200B;

**But there's always that uncertainty.** And these things are also true:

* Index funds are *boring as shit*. Compared to all the things you could be doing in the market, it seems lame to just buy a whole-market fund and chill.
* Particularly here on Reddit, with its bias for the young, there's a huge resistance to accepting the conventional wisdom. Everyone wants to build their world differently from the previous generation.
* Confirmation bias is a very powerful thing, and if you get lucky, it's very hard to believe that you were just that ... lucky. Much more satisfying to attribute it to skill.
* The increased access to market data and the access to computing tools seems to unlock so much. If you're a CS student who takes one ML class, the stock market can seem so ripe for exploitation. It's *really hard* to accept that things are not as they appear, especially when you're young & hungry.",[deleted],"Why don't you see more active strategy ETFs? The answer is simpler than you think. Until recently, actively managed ETFs weren't practically feasible.

>The recent surge is owed to a confluence of circumstances, including two major regulatory changes that made ETFs far more appealing to would-be issuers. In September 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the so-called “ETF Rule,” which standardized the regulations for launching and operating ETFs. That same year, the SEC approved the first active non-transparent ETFs, removing a major hurdle that had kept many active managers on the sidelines.

Technical analysis,investing,Two Questions About Technical Analysis,"I know people liken technical analysis to astrology, but, in my humble opinion, technical analysis can give an idea of how “Mr. Market” feels about a company. Basically, when a company is oversold, it means Mr. Market hates it, and when it’s overbought, then Mr. Market is in love with it. Having said that, I’m not a technical investor. I would base 90% of the investing decision on fundamental analysis and only 10% on technical analysis. That’s how I personally see it. But I’m not really an expert, so take what I say with a ton of salt.  
  
If you happen to use technical analysis in your decision-making process, which chart do you use? Do you use the yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily? And why do you prefer that time frame?  
  
Finally, which indicators do you think show the overbought and oversold states?",0,"> Basically, when a company is oversold, it means Mr. Market hates it, and when it’s overbought, then Mr. Market is in love with it.

This is a tautology, not a description of technical analysis. Technical analysis is the use of patterns in the price time series for an asset to predict future prices for that asset. If you believe that investable patterns of this sort exist, then you have to explain why tens or hundreds of thousands of professional investors with access to state-of-the-art research, computer hardware, and trillions of dollars of capital have missed stuff that random neckbeards on youtube found by staring at publicly available charts. It probably does happen from time to time due to sheer random chance, but I personally don't plan to bet my retirement on it over the long term.","If you ask me, I use various times for technical analysis because different times would give a very different result. Say for instance Company A has a healthy life time technical analysis but that does not mean that their 1 day or 5 days or even 6 months technical analysis is favorable. Again, if you are 90% fundamental investing, timing the entry is not that essential. Personally I would use 1 day to 1 year to time my entry point","Generally there's two interpretations to everything.  e.g. RSI is high.  OMG overbought and going to go down, or in an up-trend and likely to continue going up.  

When I actually tried to do some broad analysis, returns tended to be higher with both high and low RSI readings, with the lowest returns in the middle of the range.  But unsurprisingly, much larger standard deviations for extreme values too.  And simply by looking at a price chart, you can kind of tell that without an indicator at all.  

That's just a one-off example, but I found it to be more broadly true."

Technical analysis,investing,"GOEV, and an Amateur's shot at Technical Analysis","The following is extremely speculative. Furthermore its extreme speculation by someone not qualified to speculate.

Its really hard to tell if Canoo is a good long term investment, id imagine alot of EV companies will be wiped out as the market matures over the next couple years. In the short term they have gotten some good news, but thats not what this post is about.

$GOEV is, as far as i can tell, caught in a large Symmetric Triangle pattern. With a difference between the top and bottom of the pattern at its start  \~ $10. Given $GEOV is currently trading at 17.63, this would represent over half of the stocks total value. If the stock trends upward coming out of the pattern that would mean a target price of 27-28 dollars and nice profit on some rampant speculation. I consider this fairly risky and not recommend anyone actually attempt it.

If anyone here is more familiar with TA, any critiques on my reasoning?

Market trends,investing,"Long term population trends, implication for real estate and other markets","Was thinking tonight about how real estate has continued to become more and more expensive, (i.e. a good investment) over the past 70 years. However that price run up has been predicated both on the largest population explosion in human history, as well as artificial construction of supply, by NIMBYs and zoning laws in many parts of the world. 

I’ve always assumed that, aside from occasional collapses, real estate will continue to drift upwards, perhaps not a great investment compared to other assets, but better than inflation. 

The possibility exists of long term reversal of both of these supporting trends. Zoning laws are becoming threatened due to political backlash from how unaffordable housing has become. At the same time life in general has become so unaffordable that fertility rates are now strongly below replacement values in most of the developed world. 

Can’t say anything with any certainty of course, but I think a future of continued growth of housing prices for the next century isn’t a guarantee. Sounds obvious when I write it out, but psychologically I had a deep seated assumption that the housing market was a guaranteed success long term.  Think that may require a rethink. 

If population trends down in the developed world, that’s a possible future to consider when choosing investments. Fewer people could depress real prices of stocks in general.  Kind of difficult to know what types of companies would perform well in this scenario. I suppose technology companies specializing in automation (AI and robotics) is the only market I can think of that would do well.

What if, instead of waiting for a decision, you had a way to see decision making steps that precede execution? Searches on Google Trends and pageviews on Wikipedia precede actual decisions. This blog posts explores some theory and results.

[What Can Cognitive Science Teach Us About Stock Prices?]
(http://blog.quantopian.com/what-can-cognitive-science-teach-us-about-stock-prices/)",82,"So my understanding is there are funds that have been doing this for quite some time.  It would be hard to get at the state of the art as I'm sure this is highly proprietary information.  

You could go down this road and try and develop an algo and see what kind of profits it eeks out.  Just be warned, this is definitely not a new idea and has been around for awhile.  Heck, people have been trading based on word hits in twitter for at least half a decade. ","After having been on the markets as a self-directing investor for almost 10 years at this point... I have to deliver advice I'm sure you've read many times but have never taken to heart.

**Don't try to beat the markets.  You will only get burned.**

At best you will match the S&P500 over the very long haul.

I've had friends come and suggest all manner of ways to beat the markets to me and I tell them the same thing I've told you.  A few months later I ask how it was going and almost all of them had gotten burned out on the markets because they kept losing.  Most called it a rigged game.

This results from a misconception of what the market is.  Its movements are **NOT** the result of many individuals making decisions.  Its movements are based on MONEY.  If 1 million people sell 1 share each of a $1 stock, and a single individual buys 2 million shares of that same stock, the stock price will go up, despite the fact that the individual was outnumbered, quite literally, 1000000:1.

What's more, the big money (Mutual funds and holding companies) doesn't make decisions based on Wikipedia and Google.  Rather, they make decisions based on research of public records, investor relations and through networks of MBAs and investment analysts.

The only people who could even begin to make money based on Wikipedia and Google are the HFTs.

In short, if your capital is limited, you're far better off with boring old research than trying some exotic method to overcome a problem that's bedeviled analysts since the advent of the public market.

Furthermore, if there **WERE** a method for beating the market, the moment it became public, it would stop working.

The Black-Scholes model for option pricing is an example of this.  Once upon a time, there was no way to fairly price options and reliably make money.  They were too opaque and there were too many variables.  Along came 2 dues by the names of Black and Scholes (mind=blown, I know) who developed a formula, backtested it and then put it into practice when it showed promise.  Then they published it.  In less than a year it had an effect on the market that reduced its profitability to a fraction of what it formerly was.  To the point that the only way to guarantee gains with it was to trade millions of dollars in options at a time to achieve gains on the order of .5%.

So in short... stop trying to beat the market.","High frequency traders have been mining this kind of data for a long time and have developed algorithms that trade based on these data points.

I think a more interesting approach would be to try to reverse engineer one of these algorithms and manipulate it to make a profit.

Ex: Buy a bunch of short dated calls. Fool the algorithm into buying with fake buzz on twitter, blog comments, etc - driving up the price. Close or reverse your position before the market forces return the stock price to equilibrium.

Not sure if this would be legal, since it's essentially pump & dump. 

Although you might be able to get around the legal issue if your fake buzz wasn't actually pumping the stock - just crafted in a way that made the algorithm's sentiment analysis think so.

I'd like to collect a list of sources where I can pull ideally either daily or weekly stats that may give some me early insight into economic activity.

I'm sure a lot of this data is collected privately by hedge funds, but I'm hoping there may be some useful indicators that are publicly accessible.",8,"I run two recession probability models weekly. 

They are based on an ensemble prediction from multiple economic data series representing major sectors of the economy (employment, retail, manufacturing, housing, credit, financial). 

The first model uses all economic series found to have reasonable regression accuracy with a monthly or shorter frequency. Historical data is lagged to reflect approximate actual publication dates of the data with some series lagged up to 6-7 weeks. The second model only uses weekly or daily data with minimal publication lag for a more timely prediction. The raw data is transformed to derive a stationary series with good regression accuracy. For example, unemployment (UNRATE) is transformed to year-over-year percent change and percent relative to 12-month average. All data is evaluated at actual publication date (if known) or lagged by the current average publication delay for older data when evaluating accuracy and the accuracy is evaluated based on both the corresponding recession state and the 1-month ahead recession state (i.e. the accuracy at predicting recession 1 month in the future). 

Model 1: UNRATE, ICSA, CCSA, PAYEM, USCONS, RRSFS, CSCICP, IPCONGD, INDPRO, GACDFSA066MSFRBPHI, AWHMAN, HTRUCKSSAAR, PERMIT, MSACSR, HOUST, T10Y3M, T10Y2Y , NFCI, ANFCI, NFCICREDIT, NFCIRISK, NFCINONFINLEVERAGE, SP500

Model 2 (Minimal Lag): ICSA, CCSA, T10Y3M, T10Y2Y, BAA10Y, NFCI, ANFCI, NFCICREDIT, NFCIRISK, NFCINONFINLEVERAGE, SP500

The data series are all available from FRED and can be accessed by API.


Model 1, RP=65%, interestingly current recession shows significant split between empl/retail/manf/housing and credit/financial. The prior indicators are all solidly signalling recession, while the latter only signaled a recession for one or two weeks back in early April. This is consistent with the sentiment in this sub of the impact of strong fed support of the financial markets and the start difference in the condition of the rest of the economy that impacts most workers: https://i.imgur.com/iilef2k.png

Model 2, RP=36%, noisier but faster to respond. No longer indicated recession but this model is more heavily based on financial/credit indicators which are available daily or weekly: https://i.imgur.com/OIKhraL.png",I keep an eye on consumer debt and delinquency.

The last few months the markets moved a lot. And with the Fed having a lot of meetings concerning interest rate hikes and the overal economic condition, it was pretty easy to time and predict the market. Negative news for the economy made positive news for the markets. As soon as the cpi/jolt/ppi/pce numbers arrived on websites with summaries about macroeconomic reports the market responded accordingly.

Now, I’m pretty new to (macro) swingtrading and I’m curious how the market react to those reports in different market conditions (high /low base rate, expanding market, contracting market etc.).

Economic indicators,investing,Why are people convinced rising rates will cause an economic collapse?,"I've seen lots of comments on the sub basically dreading the 7% point, since raising rates - to them - ensures economic collapse.

What indicators are there? Unemployment is near all-time lows of the last twenty years, VIX is down, and we are nowhere near deflation for that to be an issue. Housing prices are still incredibly hot.

So what leads everyone to think that nudging rates high will cause collapse?",420,"Rising rates makes credit less accessible. Which leads to less consumption and eventually a possible recession. This is on the consumer side. On company sides it’s the same story, borrowing is more expensive so that means they have to cut back. Job loss is usually a lagging indicator and housing prices being unaffordable and lower number of sales means an illiquid market which can go south fast. Or that people are borrowing too much money for homes…

The main indicator that people will reference is the inverted yield curve or 10Y-3M bonds being negative. Which means the bond market expects more economic uncertainty in the near term versus farther out. Another way to look at it is there is less confidence that borrowers will pay back loans in the near term.

Not enough cash relative to debt coupled with less productivity is a common cause of recessions.","Virtually ever recession starts when unemployment is near all time lows. It’s a lagging indicator. First softness, then you are like shit, it’s for real, cut people.

Rates cause recessions because they quite literally stop commerce. A $400k loan at 3% vs 7% increases the monthly payment by $975!

stock,investing,PSA: Stock promotion and suspicious stock recommendations,"For those new to Reddit and to investing subreddits - many people often complain that r/investing mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

One reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. This morning - an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations.

One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.

Shares of [Hertz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HTZ) halted trading Wednesday pending news amid the bankrupt company’s controversial stock sale.

The stoppage follows the Securities and Exchange Commission telling [Hertz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HTZ) that the regulator [has issues](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/the-sec-told-bankrupt-hertz-it-has-issues-with-its-plan-to-sell-stock-chairman-jay-clayton-says.html) with the rental car company’s plan to sell stock.

“In this particular situation, we have let the company know that we have comments on their disclosure,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said on CNBC’s [“Squawk on the Street”](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/) on Wednesday. “In most cases when you let a company know that the SEC has comments on their disclosure they do not go forward until those comments are resolved.”

Shares were trading down about half a percent to $1.94.

Hertz filed for bankruptcy May 22, hurt as demand for car rentals dried up as travelers have stayed home during the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/). The stock hit a low of 40 cents intraday on May 26. But in the days ahead, shares began to recover and eventually surged to more than $6 per share last Monday.

Following the increase, Hertz asked the bankruptcy court Thursday to allow it to sell up to $1 billion in shares, a last ditch effort for it to raise capital even though the value of the stock could get wiped out. The request [was approved by the court Friday.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/hertz-granted-approval-to-sell-up-to-1-billion-in-shares.html)

Hertz said in a government filing Monday that it would sell up to $500 million in common stock. It warned potential investors that it’s [almost certain that the equity will become worthless.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/15/hertz-says-it-expects-stockholders-to-lose-all-their-money-in-filing-for-selling-more-stock.html)

Such a sale is highly unusual for a company going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since common shareholders, who are last in line when assets are allocated during court proceedings, may be left with worthless stock.

The court, in its ruling, said the approval “in no event will result in the issuance” of the shares. The debtors are authorized, but not required, to sell shares of the common stock.

The stock also could be delisted. Hertz in a public filing with the [SEC last week said](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3581821-hertz-to-challenge-nyse-delisting) that it has appealed a delisting request by the NYSE.

Trading activity in names like Hertz has spiked on millennial-favored stock trading app Robinhood in the days following the bankruptcy filings, according to Robintrack, which tracks Robinhood account activity but is not affiliated with the company.",1317,"All the day traders that were thinking they could sell out of the stock before it collapses are now screwed.

This is how you catch CoVID-19!","Unlike speculations or other types of bubbles or news that make the market go down, a corona pandemic is the kind of thing that actually affects the underlying revenue of the market - people don't go to cinema, don't go on cruises, companies don't make money, go bankrupt, etc... 

If you believe in any way that the value of a stock is correlated to the underlying revenue and assets of a company (which it should), then it makes perfect sense that the market goes down, not only because of panic sell, but realistically, there will be months with no revenue or negative revenue for a lot of companies, so their value, as a multiple of that, has to reflect that.

Yes, things will bounce back again of course and it will go back to normal, but it will not ""make up"" for 6 months or so when people didn't use the companies services. Like if people don't go to cinema for 6 months because of fear of virus, they won't say after it's done, ok, now we go 3 times per week to cinema to make up for how much we missed, they'll just resume going to cinema regularly. Those of quarters of revenue with missed losses will be forever negative on a company books."

Details are pretty sketchy because AFAIK its still pretty new, but article says China is readying increased tariffs on $60b of US imports from June 1. Increases are supposed to range from 25% to 10% depending on product ... (percentage figures sourced from live coverage on the Guardian)... ""with the steepest penalties hitting certain beef,  live plants, dyed flowers, and a range of fruits and vegetables. The  tariffs would range from 5 percent to 25 percent "".

So it seems they are targeting the agricultural sector which is probably par course and what was expected.

trade,investing,Gamestop Big Picture: Evolution of a Trade," *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

So.. I mentioned possibly doing a 'post mortem' on my GME trade, and apparently that was in high demand.  That being said, I'll call it an 'evolution' instead, as we still don't yet know what will happen next.

Rather than going through a full narrative, I made a [crazy annotated chart](https://u.teknik.io/xg2HJ.PNG) to chronicle some of the key points in my trade decisions.

Strangely enough, I think it might better convey how the week went from my perspective a little better than a full narrative.  If you catch any inconsistencies between the chart, or my writing below, please point it out.  It's very easy to ex post facto ascribe to yourself the benefit of 20/20 foresight and overlook mistakes you made at the time.

I'll walk through my thought process for newer traders.  Keep in mind I'm trading my hobby account, not a self-directed IRA, so the stakes are a lot lower and tolerance for risk is much higher:

1. I would probably trace the initial origins of this trade for me back to November.  I wasn't a genius like DFV finding GME at that point, but once the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine efficacy data came out, I decided to go rummaging through XRT (retail)  and other unloved sectors for value that should rebound on the sector rotation to the 'reopening trade' given the nosebleed multiples in QQQ (the NASDAQ/big tech companies that dominated the market in 2020).  Figured I'd mostly ride the SMH (semiconductor index) and a few other favorites while digging around.  Looking at unloved sectors is the value/long term investor version of 'buy the dip' (typically the dip might last years, but I figured in this case the evolution would be much faster because it would be driven by progress against COVID).
2. ID'd GME for the short list because of an unusually regular pattern on the daily chart RSI.  In hindsight I would probably attribute that to one of the hedge funds trying to stealthily unwind its short position veeeeery slowly, but GME being a dead corner of the market, it shows up in the data like a lighthouse beacon, in a channel upward just bouncing off RSI 70.  Someone is gradually accumulating a big long position or covering a big short position.  TJX's looks better, but valuation too high already (over-loved).
3. Deep dive DD, including DD from WSB just makes me think this is exactly what I've been looking for.  Better buy in before it escapes completely.  
4. Ok..it made some massive moves already, but with the bonus of the short interest anomaly this is too good..  and it comes with awesome memes--can't say no to the package deal. $38 (my first buy) is pretty good, but I'll write April $40 cash-secured puts to net me a better entry (or additional profit if they go unexercised).  This is a common technique investors can use to get either a better entry than they otherwise could get, or some participation in the upside if the price runs away--I find it easier to do this than setting an aggressively low GTC limit buy and keeping my fingers crossed.
5. Digging deeper into the short squeeze thesis tells me it's practically mathematically guaranteed to go off any moment.  I take off some cash-secured puts, liquidate a lot of the rest of my portfolio, etc. because if things get as crazy as I think they might, it's better to have almost nothing else in your portfolio to complicate matters.  This is especially true as margin requirements start rising.
6. Volatility starts going crazy.  You almost can't see it on the daily chart with the scaling of the 500+ peak, but if you focus on the 1/21 to 1/26 timeframe there were a few brutal Eiffel tower moves (parabolic up then down).  All kinds of misinformation about what is going on starts flying.  People start FOMOing into those moves only to despair out on the other side for a loss.  Few if any seem to be willing to talk about the situation in a way that newer traders can understand.  I start posting a bit here and there, just getting a feel for reddit.
7. On 1/25 I see a few heated discussions regarding whether the gap up over the weekend, then crash down that day in fact WAS the squeeze, and I try to jump in and correct the record a bit.. people are panicking out on the downside of that move because they're being told the squeeze is over.  That motivates me to write my first article in the series.  Don't finish it that evening, decide to finish it in the morning.  It drops on this sub essentially as what we now know was the squeeze is achieving liftoff.
8. Looking at my posts from 1/25 to 1/29, I'm probably too tuned in to the hype, but tuning in to sentiment is important in sentiment-driven momentum trading.  I do try to consistently try to warn new traders from FOMOing in, but that doesn't stop me from trying to help them understand what is going on.
9. One thing I've learned the hard way--don't carry a sentiment-driven momentum trading position through a weekend.  That usually does not end well.
10. The weekend gives me time to step back and resume a more analytical approach and you may notice my writing style reflects that at that point.  Looking back, I notice a lot of sloppiness and some outright errors in my realtime read of the situation.  I try to point some of those out if I feel they might be material to others' trading decisions.
11. At this point I'm thinking the squeeze has been mostly squoze (but for a few 'technically it's still possible' type scenarios).  I figure since so many of the regular readers/commentators on my posts are going to ride it, I'll keep a position on to ride it with them too.  We'll see where we go from here!

I actually did really well on the trade overall.  Could have done much better had I just stuck to my trades rather than reading and writing on Reddit, but the numerous comments I've seen where I or other commentators in this sub were able to provide good, level-headed feedback and advice helped people make better decisions make it worthwhile to me.  I guess it just bothered me too much to see the vacuum of real information and willingness of people to push their trade on others.  I didn't see that kind of behavior in WSB even just the week prior when I first joined.

Also, while it turned out very well, I have to be completely intellectually honest and admit that I could have lost it all too.  This was a crazy volatile trade with more twists and turns and unexpected developments than I could have imagined, and that's even given that I actually believe it when I say that I don't know what will happen next.  This is something anyone knowingly walking into this type of situation should realize and plan for.

Each person has a different tolerance for risk, though I will say that while I was and am willing to take significant risks with my hobby trading account, I try to never take entirely irrational risks.  I also actively put at risk a relatively small percent of even my hobby trading capital (\~20%).  It may not seem like it, as you've seen my writing on a high volatility play, but my overall capital disposition is very conservative and low-risk/low-volatility in aggregate.  It's because I know that most of it is safe that I can feel comfortable and controlled making very high risk plays.

I've seen people put it all on the line and totally clutch trade big momentum--I wish I could, but I know that's not me.

There are a few sayings that traders have as almost jokes, but with an undercurrent of dark humor in many cases:

1. **Rule #1: never lose money.** From Warren Buffett, value investing legend.  I'm a little more flexible with this for myself, and amend it to ""always have a plan that guarantees you can never lose more money than you intended to put at risk.""  If you are in the red on this trade, realized or unrealized, don't feel bad--I'm very confident that most people are in the same boat.  Try to think of it as tuition for one of the most intense, and hopefully intellectually productive seminars ever, held only once every decade or so.
2. **No one ever went bankrupt taking profit, or pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.** (counterpoint: tons of people have gone essentially bankrupt riding profits right back into the ground--particularly in climactic late bubble market action, like the dotcom bubble).  To those of you feeling bad that you could have made more, be glad that you were in the green.  It's something to celebrate.  You traded a black swan event and came out ahead.
3. **Buy low, sell high.**  MUCH harder to do consistently than it seems.  Particularly if you initiate a [trade from FOMO](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/gkyxdqv/?context=3).  For those of you who did this, try to remember what that was like, and think of ways you can manage those emotions in the future, or ensure you never put yourself in a similar position if you'd rather not have to.  Either approach will be healthier for both you and your wallet in the long run.

Alright, this post is long enough as is.  We'll see where the rocket takes us tomorrow.

Good luck in the market!",531,you wont lose money by not making a trade you dont understand.,"I bought in at 330 and then again at 280 for a 307 average. I've got a good amount of savings to cover me, but will have to explain my losses... My thinking was ""If I lose this, it sets me back 2-3 years. If I win this, life gets a LOT easier moving forward."" Worth the risk. 

I still think I was right in the decision to FOMO buy; I bought a day before the big jump to 500. But I was absolutely wrong to trust the echo chamber and not sell when we saw the whole system turn against us. Once RH and other brokers restricted buying for more than one day I should have pulled out. The day before it dropped to 181 closing I still would have made a profit if I sold in the morning. 

An extremely expensive lesson and currently I'm just going to hold the stock. It seems reasonable that the price may go higher than the current 77 if RC and his team turn the company around - the money I get from selling now won't make a huge difference to me in the short term anyway. 

Sucks ass though, but I learnt something about myself. And now I get to look at those numbers everyday and say, ""You little shit, this was your mistake. How are you going to make up for it? No more of wasting your time and day, it's time to live life properly. PUSH yourself god-dammit!""

Stock market,stocks,Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market,"I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.

Here is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.

[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  
[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security’s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.

[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.

[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.

[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a ""cloud"" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.

[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.

MA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.

Pivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.

SAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.

SuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.",5368,"The best indicator for newbies is this one:

**If you see 20 threads a day about a stock, you're too late.**","I personally use only 3 Moving average at 20,50,200 periods. All the rest of my analysis is based on fundamentals and future growth",Thank you for writing this out. When I first learned about VWAP it changed how I approached day trading entirely. Another indicator I would suggest new traders to explore and monitor would be Macro sentiments which also helps to determine if a stock is currently overbought or oversold.

Current capitalisations:

* London - $2.821trn

Before the Brexit vote in 2016, the capitalisation gap was $1.5trn in favour of London.

Pretty stunning capitulation of the London stock market. Some of this gap closing has been due to currency fluctuations, but that can still be largely attributed to the Brexit vote.

* Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.
* The East India Company is widely recognized as the world’s first publicly traded company and the reason for them publicly traded is because of **risk**. Sailing all over the planet was too risky for any company during that time. Ships were lost, fortunes were squandered, and financiers realized they had to do something to mitigate all that risk.
* Early stock trading happened at **Coffee shops,** and stocks were hand written in paper and inventors had to trade their stocks with other investors in coffee shops.
* It was tough to make out legit companies to illegitimate companies back in the day, and in many cases companies were able to make tons of money before a single ship was ever set for sail. And because of that a bubble was burst and the government of England banned the issuing of shares until 1825.
* And despite ban of issuing shares, **London Stock Exchange** was established in 1801, it was very limited exchange because of the ban of issuing shares.
* And in 1817, **New York stock exchange** was established and it started trading since its very first day.
* And today, almost every single country has a stock market.  Every day, trillions of dollars are traded on stock markets.

Here are the top 10 stock markets in the world today ranked by market capitalization:

2. NASDAQ

Also, assuming a stock does not fluctuate randomly and is perfectly priced relative to its dividend, its value will gradually increase until the next dividend date, then drop again.

For a while I thought that I should hold for a year or more to pay the lower long term tax rate but that idea seems fairly poor when the market is extremely volatile. 

A strategy I have considered is to sell all my shares and then rebuy at the same level to lock in gains.  I think this would lock in any profits in the near term and could enable further dollar cost averaging if the shares go down again.  If the shares continue to go up then at least I still have them.

Trading strategy,stocks,FOR EVERYONE NEW TO INVESTING: A COMPREHENSIVE BREAKDOWN OF TRADING AND MANIPULATION STRATEGIES!,"**Current Conditions of the Market:**

Let me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There’s a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don’t make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous “pump and dumps” where stocks become inflated, and based on fool’s theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research. 

**Basic Stock Jargons & Short/Long Positions:**

*Long* \- you’re buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.

*Short* \- you’re borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I’ll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:

* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.
* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.
* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is “long” on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.
* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10. 
* Two hypothetical situation happens now:
   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he’s making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the “short” lost money, the “long” gained money, and the “lender” made interest money. 
   * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the “short” made money, the “long” lost money, and the “lender” made interest money. 
* The above scenarios help to show why “shorts” (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc. 

**Market Manipulation:**

Market manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy “whales” or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are “shorts”. Some are “neutral” and act as lenders to make money, some are “growth-based” and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are “short” which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.

**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**

Market manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.

*Scenario 1:*

Let’s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can “hedge” or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the “premium” or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly “cover”, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.

*Scenario 2:*

Let’s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name “FANG” stocks.

 If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing “newly” purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc. 

*Scenario 3:*

This one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster. 

Algorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I’ll start by talking about “market orders” vs “limit orders”. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says “market order” or “limit order”. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a “limit order”, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated. 

In the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it’s processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you’re that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER.

Trading strategy,stocks,Trading Strategy on Capital Gains/Losses,"I [posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/y422lz/capital_gainslosses_strategy/) same question over in /tax and didn't get any actual input..

Has anyone taken this approach?  If so, what are the upsides/downsides?

I  have $25,000 in long term and short term capital gains this year, and I'm looking at a pretty hefty tax bill.  Between state and federal taxes, I estimate I'll owe 25%.

I'm under the impression the odds are in favor of me day trading.   Theoretically there is a 50/50 the markets will go up or down.  If I buy $100k of SPY, for example and only hold it for the day - I  theoretically have a 50% chance of making money.  However if it goes down 1% and I sell, I realize a $1,000 loss.  This would lower my capital gains to $24,000.

Instead of me paying the gov't $6,250 on $25,000  I'd pay $6,000 on $24,000.   Which means my 1% loss of $1,000 is essentially a loss of 0.75%, or $750.  And if it goes up, same thing.  I make $1,000 and have $750 left over after taxes.

As long as I have capital gains, is there any downside to this strategy?",6,"There is essentially never a benefit to intentionally losing money to offset capital gains, you will always lose more money then you would have had to pay in taxes. The only benefits could be if you had an opportunity cost to allocate capital elsewhere or if for some bizarre reason there was changing legislation/tax brackets upcoming. Just pay your taxes.","Man you robbed 10 min of my life thinking about this shitty theory making any sense.

It does not. Losses are losses. Gains are gains. Only thing you can decide is you want to have more cash now (tax harvest) or later (hold). 

At best market tanks and you lose 25k. If you harvest you have 6k more cash in your pocket today (instead of some point later in your investment life) but market did fuck you. Nice strategy.","I was just thinking the same thing, sort of. Sell a chunk of net losers, wait 30 days, and rebuy. It would reduce my taxes from other income sources. 

also, depending on your tax bracket, long term gains are lower tax % than short term. The trick would be to realize your enough losses to cover realized gains, while holding the unrealized gains long till next year, to lower the tax bracket. (While also avoiding wash sale.)

“You can deduct capital losses up to the amount of your capital gains plus $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately). You may be able to use capital losses that exceed this limit in future years.” (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sd.pdf)

So in your case, you could “lose” up to $28,000 this year.  

This is known as tax-loss harvesting btw."
Trading strategy,stocks,Shorts as a day trading strategy.,"Id like to preface this by saying I have very little investing experience in the stock market, Im primarily invested in real-estate. Also if this is not the right sub please let me know where this should go!

The past month I've become interested in learning more about stocks and decided to give day trading a shot via a paper account. I initially tried several stratagies and types of analysis to hop on trends and try to turn a consistent win rate, mostly to little success. 

However in the past week and a half I've noticed a relationship between RSI and stocks (mostly HTB but not always) that very quickly jump in price. Essentially when these stocks spike in price and RSI indicates very oversold I short, the stock price will correct over the next few minutes and I'll cover and scalp a quick profit. 

I did over 60 trades in this manner over the last week and hit a win rate of 82% and made 68% gains on the paper account ($18,750 to $31,539). Im aware the paper account was not taking HTB fees and keeping track of maintenance requirements but this was more an exercise in achieving a consistent win rate. If I had made the exact same traded and cover a few days after the initial short my win rate jumped to 92%. Ill have photos of the trades as  well an excel sheet detailing the individual trades as well as analysis scaleing down to a minimum margin account complying with pattern trading regulations. 

Im looking for advice on if this is actually viable outside of a paper trading environment, can a win rate like this be achieved and should I bring in anymore analysis outside RSI, MACD, KDJ and volume to float? Any advice from people who short stocks regularly would be appreciated!",8,"Do you have a solid exit strategy?

Trading strategy,stocks,Day trading strategy,Hey im new to stocks and i jus want to know if my strategy is good. So basically im day trading wit 10k and to make 300-400 a day it jus has to go up 3% so i go to top gainers check if for the past week it has been going up around 2-3 percent per day and once i find that i jus put it in the morning and wait for that 2-3% jump and exit. It has been working so far but i want sum extra output. Thanksss,0,Ahhh if it were only so simple. Play with fire and you may get burnt. Goodluck.,it works til it doesn't,DO NOT day trade. I do not recommend that you do this - you’ve just been lucky.
Options trading,stocks,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

Hope this was helpful, let me know what ya think!!",1862,So one of the main reasons to trade options is to be given the opportunity to trade with leverage?,"Great post by the OP. One aspect he did not touch on is the fact that all the pieces that go into the value of an option act like exponential curves. Why is this important to understand?

Let's start with theta (or time value). Theta decay is not linear. If we compare an April and July option of the same strike, the value of the option will drop more tomorrow in the April option than it will in the July option. In fact, there is virtually no theta decay in the July option right now. Theta decay really becomes important to consider 30 days before expiration.

In my trading, I prefer to trade in options 60-90 days out. It will cost me more to own that theta but it also gives me the chance to change my mind in the first few weeks without losing theta value. This is a more conservative approach. I use options to generate small incremental returns or to add some profit opportunity to core positions when I think a news item might move the stock sharply.

The next variable to consider is called **delta**.  This variable measures the rate of change expected in the option relative to the underlying stock price. If I buy a $100 strike call on a stock trading at $120, the option should rise $1 for each $1 rise in the stock.  This is called delta 1 in the industry, the one is shorthand for 1.0 or 100% - the option price change will reflect 100% of the stock price change. ""Delta 20"" means 20%. Optimally, you want an option that goes from delta 20 or 30 to delta 1 with 20-30 days left before expiration. You get the benefit of the share price move AND preserve some theta value you can re-capture in the sale.  Unfortunately, there are no freely available tools that will tell you the delta of a particular option. Without them, you have to just feel it out but a good rule of thumb is a 30% differential is roughly delta 30 and a 40%+ differential is probably delta 10 (i.e. the option is not going to budge much even if the stock moves 10%).

You will get the most out of an option if you can play those periods where the delta is increasing rapidly. Take that $100 stock again. Let's buy a call option with a $130 strike price. If the stock goes to $101, the option will not move much. As the stock rises more, the option will react more. This is how you can make a very high rate of return on options. That 30% strike premium will make the option quite cheap, maybe a $1 depending on the other variable. If the stock gets to $120, that option is probably close to $3, triple your money.

The last important variable is **vol**, short for volatility. A stock that has large, frequent swings is more likely to hit any given strike price than a slow-moving stock. Traders price the options differently as a result. In bull markets, general stock market vol declines which generally means that individual stock vol declines as well on average. But if markets start behaving dramatically, stock option values increase as this vol becomes more valuable. This is why having some puts in your portfolio after strong bull markets might make sense. Puts increase in prices as stocks fall AND as vol increases. It's a double payday.

The value of an option is largely the sum of these three variables. Theta is a cost you have to just accept. The higher the delta in an option, the less risk you have of losing everything at the cost of much-reduced upside. Since changes in vol are very hard to predict, it is really just a bonus if you catch it.",PSA. This post is missing a lot of key pieces to options trading.

Fundamental analysis,stocks,Peloton fundamental analysis and valuation - The market is irrational!,"Peloton has been a public company for less than 3 years and its share price has been all over the place. It is now down over 90% since its all-time high back at the end of December 2022 and the volatility has been crazy.

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals, lay down some assumptions about the future, and value the company as a whole.

Feedback is always welcomed!

&#x200B;

**What is Peloton?**

In a nutshell, it is a company that's making money by offering:

\- Connected fitness products - Exercise equipment (bikes, treads, and soon rowing machines)

\- Subscriptions - Media content related to fitness (pilates, strength training, stretching, yoga, meditation)

\- Fitness apparel (insignificant in terms of revenue at this very moment)

&#x200B;

**The hype**

As we all know, the pandemic caused this company's share price to go through the roof. The demand for their products skyrocketed thanks to the lockdown and the media coverage of their products.

***Connected fitness products***

The revenue of their connected fitness products grew from $734m in 2019 to $1,5b in 2020 (99% growth) to $3,2b in 2021 (115% growth).

*\*Note - Their fiscal year ends 30 June, hence, 2021 is the year starting July 1st, 2020 to June 30th, 2021.*

However, these products are generally considered more premium/luxury. For the same amount of money, one can subscribe to a budget-level gym for roughly 10 years and have access to a lot more equipment.

During this period, the gross margin that they had on these products was around 40%, which is quite high for a company in this industry, but the increased demand did its job well.

Until 2022 started and the growth was nowhere to be found. The revenue declined to $2,2b (-31%) and the decline was over 50% if the last quarter was to be compared year over year.

Not only that, but the gross margin was -11%. No, it is not a typo, they lost money on the sale of these products.

When there's a huge decline in the level of demand, it has a huge impact on the prices (Economics 101). Of course, the tough part was to estimate the level of demand for the coming period with all the uncertainty.

In 2022, the management put a lot of capital into inventory to meet the demand, which wasn't as high as before. So, at the end of 2022 (As of June 30th), there's roughly $1.1b in inventory. That's roughly 50% of all the sales they made in the entire last year. As the prices decline, they had to take impairment for some of these products.

***Subscriptions***

This, in my opinion, is their cash cow segment. It has been growing from $181m in 2019 to $364m in 2020 (101%) to $872m in 2021 (140%) to $1,4b in 2022 (60%).

The gross margin improved from 43% to 68% during the same period.

It seems that the company is more focused on selling connected fitness products as a way to reach out to its target customers and actually make money on the subscriptions.

&#x200B;

**The other operating costs**

If we combine both revenue sources together, the total revenue for the last 12 months was $3,6b with a thin gross margin of 19% (gross margin of close to $700m).

Every young company is known for incurring losses due to heavy spending on Research & Development and Sales & Marketing that would allow them to grow fast. In that respect, Peloton is no different.

In 2022, the spendings were as follows:

1. Sales & Marketing - $1b
2. General & Administrative - $1b
3. Research & Development - $360m

It is quite clear that the gross profit of $700m is not sufficient to cover these main operating expenses. Peloton lost over $1.6b from its operations (-46% operating margin). This is not that surprising as the majority of the high-growth companies are losing money due to the higher than average spending on Sales & Marketing and Research & Development. However, when the growth is no longer there, that's when it becomes ugly. In addition, I was not impressed by the level of R&D spending as Peloton's long-term success is highly dependent on its innovation.

&#x200B;

But that's not all. They had 3 ""one-time expenses"" during the year:

1. Impairments - $562m - Mainly related to goodwill, part as mentioned above to inventories
2. Supplier settlements - $338m - Based on the information available, it relates to the settlement of litigation with iFIT
3. Restructuring - $181m - As the demand falls, the number of employees is reduced

It could be argued that these are one-time expenses (as they were non-existent in the past), however, as the demand is falling and their inventory levels are high, it would not be surprising if there are further impairments, further restructuring, and who knows whether there will be further supplier settlements. If we take all of this into account, the operating loss of the company was -2,7b (-76% operating margin).

&#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

On the balance sheet, apart from the high inventory levels mentioned above, there's around $1.3b in cash. Although on its own is a big number, it doesn't seem so big when we take into account the last year's losses company had. If the margins don't improve dramatically, they will be raising capital during the next 6-12 months.

They already have a debt of $2,4b (for comparison purposes, their market cap is $3,6b) so they're in a tough position.

&#x200B;

**Striking deal with Amazon**

In the last 7 days, there were 2 huge headlines. The first one was the deal that Peloton announced that part of their products will be available for purchase in Amazon US stores.

The share price went up around 20%.

Only a few days later, they shared the 2022 earnings and the share price returned to the same levels.

This is a great example of how short-sighted the market can be at times. The deal with Amazon could be a great way to dispose of a large portion of the inventory that's just sitting there, but Amazon will take its share. That means Peloton's margins are not going to be as high (let's not forget, they're already losing money on their connected fitness products).

The more important question is, is there going to be increased demand for their products, regardless of whether they're being sold through Amazon or direct to the final consumer?

&#x200B;

**The key assumptions about the future & valuation**

If we take a look at the analysts' expectations regarding next year's revenue, it ranges from $2,29b for the entire year (-36% compared to 2022) to $5,82b (+63% compared to 2022). This huge expectations gap shows the uncertainty around the company.

My personal views are that the Amazon deal will help their connected fitness products to not have a significant revenue decline, while the subscription revenue is still growing strong. However, I don't expect their operating margin to improve significantly in the next year.

Hence, my assumptions are as follows:

&#x200B;

||2023|2024 to 2027|2028 to 2032|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|\-5% decline|5% growth / year|3% growth / year|
|Operating margin|\-20%|slowly improve to 5%|slowly improve to 15%|

My expectations are that the company has to focus more on cost-cutting and less on significantly growing revenue (other than their subscription revenue)

Discount rate: 8% today, increasing to 8.8% in 10 years

Based on those assumptions, the fair value of the company is close to $1,2b (**$3.48/share)**

The current market cap is $3,58b ($10,61/share)

*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.*

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 39% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 15%.

I am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|10%|15%|20%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|24% ($4,4b)|\-$1.9|$2.7|$7.2|
|39% ($5,0)|\-$1.6|$3.5|$8.5|
|192% ($10,5b)|$1.3|$11.3|$21.4|
|300% ($14,3b)|$3.2|$16.7|$30.3|

&#x200B;

This table illustrates well how important it is for Peloton to cut costs and improve margin. In some cases, the fair value of the company is even negative, meaning it's not worth anything! Of course, one can argue that those assumptions are too pessimistic, but there is a chance that it plays out.

Of course, if they manage to grow 300% in the next 10 years (which is the assumption of the most optimistic analyst) and on top they improve the operating margin to 20%, there's 3x upside.

However, that means Peloton will need to bring $14,3b in revenue in 10 years. Just for comparison purposes, the total gym revenue in the US is $32b/year. This is a mature market, so growth is not expected.

Let's not forget that the share price at the peak of the hype was over $160/share. If that seems crazy, it is only because it was crazy! To justify a price of $160/share, Peloton needs to bring in 2x the revenue of all US gyms combined and have a higher operating margin than 25%.

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on Peloton as a company?

Also, feel free to provide feedback regarding the analysis, that is always appreciated!",153,"I think your assumptions were, if anything, generous.  And the company is still overvalued 3x.  I think a significant possibility here, too, is that the nature of this sort of exercise is faddish.  As such, Peloton will decrease in popularity and won't hit your revenue projections.  I'm skeptical of continued high growth in their subscriber business, but that's probably because I'm biased against the company.","It seems likely that they will just be bought out eventually as their subscriber count is their largest MOAT considering people really do enjoy their instructors, classes, and how engaging they are.

Subscriber count is what matters most to Peloton. It's now bringing in more revenue than their actual equipment. I believe the Amazon deal makes a ton of sense for Peloton as it opens up the market for users. People are confident when they shop at Amazon because the customer experience is more secure. 

Their new CEO is the former CFO of Netflix and Spotify. He's all about subscriber count and that's honestly where they need to be focused on.","I generally agree with everything here. To be fair though, we just went through a once-in-a-generation pandemic with an unprecedented lockdown. There was a very reasonable hypothesis that this period, along with normalized fully-remote work, was going to rapidly accelerate adoption of thing like e-commerce, at-home fitness, etc. that would persist after lockdowns ended. Total US gym revenue is a bit of a red-herring because something like 10% of the population has a recurring gym membership and the vast majority of that is made up of inconvenient, budget fitness providers around medium-to-large population centers. I don’t think anyone is crazy for thinking there a massive opportunity for disruption that could blow the lid off the current market size.

A lot of people and businesses bet on this both in the market and in business models. It turned out to be mostly wrong, but I don’t think it was totally irrational.

ETA: Most major breakthrough investments looked completely irrational before they were breakthroughs. There was a time when the thought of a text-based web search being worth $1T would have been insane"

Fundamental analysis is looking at the value of the company and then trying to find undervalued companies and investing in them. It's for a long term play. 

Technical analysis is more about looking at day to day movements and trying to use psychology to figure out where a stock is heading and the price. This is more used for swing traders or day traders. Not really something a long term investor would look into. 

They are different ways of looking at the market, but you use them differently depending on your goals.","I am a short to mid-range trader and I use fundamental analysis on every stock I consider.  I use it as a REJECTOR of stocks, not so much as a selector of stocks.  For me, a stock has to have certain fundamental characteristics, and if it doesn't, I remove it from consideration.  Some of the fundamentals it MUST have are:  positive cash flow, yearly profit, price above $1 and low cashflow to price ratio.","Long story short, stocks are not lottery tickets. Each stock represents a business that is worth x based on its assets and the cash flows that generates.

If you can estimate how much a company is worth and be able to purchase below that amount, you're going to be rewarded once the market realizes the mismatch between stock price and intrinsic value.

That's why we do fundamental analysis."
Fundamental analysis,stocks,Fundamental analysis / Overwhelmed!,"I am confused and overwhelmed with information overload. Can someone give me an eli5 of what it is and also what are the most important things to look for when conducting a fundamental analysis of a company? 

I see some websites say look for these 5 things but then I see on Reddit some people have check lists 50 questions long.",7,"The market is fucking stooopid
like a company can have made a profit no debt and their stock tanks.. and a company can have lost money every fucking year and the stock goes up.. let alone cancer/medical research companies being shorted to penny stocks and companies who have never made or contribute a single fucking thing are 80$ a fucking share.. so yeah let me know when you know brah","This is a field that entire careers are built around. It's like asking: ""Can you give me a list to instantly become an electrician?""

The material and methodology *is* learnable, but it takes time and discipline. There isn't a one-size-fits-all way to do this, which is why markets kind of exist. That's also the reason why almost everyone not working in finance (and even those that are) keep the majority of their wealth in broadly diversified index funds. You'll track the market with zero effort.

If you're trying to beat the market, it is nearly impossible to do without a lot of effort, education, and research. There are hundreds of books about valuation

There *are* some common and easy things to get a quick overview of the general valuation of a company, but every single one is different. And, more importantly, every industry is unique. You have to really understand the product/service being offered, how the business model works, the market to which its offered, and especially the competitive landscape and how one company's product is different than another.

If you get a book on taking the Series 65 exam (the one for financial advisors), it has a lot of good info about valuation and macroeconomics. Just skip all the legal stuff.","The things I look for the most:

1. Low PE Ratio. Yes, this is important. Lower than 28, ok. Lower than 24, cool. Lower than 20, great. Lower than 17, even better. But ignore PE if its a small cap, because most all small caps have a low PE.
2. High revenue growth. 15/20%+ per year. Though it can be lower for some industries like retail or financial.
3. A ROIC of 15%+ (0.15+). Calculated by:   Taking the average net income from the past 5 years, and dividing it by (share holder equity + long-term debt + short-term debt).
4. Are they buying back shares or offloading more and therefor diluting your shareholder value? Very important. COIN put out 100% more shares last quarter, significantly cutting the value of their shareholders in one swoop.
5. Are they making acquisitions? Are their retail locations increasing or decreasing? Is a important patent expiring? Is most of their new revenue from covid? Who's their competition? Are they losing market share? Etc etc. You can discover this through the research phase after approving their financials. But I base 75% of my decision by looking at numbers."
Fundamental analysis,stocks,UWMC A Fundamental Analysis of why this stock is deeply undervalued - The Latest in a Series,"Hey /r Stocks. Admittedly, i usually post this elsewhere, and my series of Due Diligence on this stock is posted elsewhere, but I thought that you guys could actually value this stock on deep value metrics. Please be aware this DD is a day old, and the stock has now been up for the last 5 trading days.

Greetings and salutations. I wrote my last DD on UWMC 2 weeks ago, and it was the latest of a series. With Earnings announced, and the recent runup from its lows, I thought an update was in order as there's a lot of new information to parse through.

First, a status update on the stock price movement itself. After my last due diligence, the stock continued a downward trend down to 7.18 (for a 5.55% Dividend if you bought at that price point!), before it started sharply reversing course after a Barclay's Analyst initiated Coverage with a 10$ price target stating that FY 2022 EPS was roughly 6.5 Forward Earnings for 2022, and that UWMC was poised to grab more market share. This was amid a prior backdrop of positive news coverage about how undervalued the stock was, and how it was almost inexplicable (Spanning The Motley Fool, Investor Place, and SeekingAlpha) in the days prior to this analyst coverage.

The Stock has been positive the last 4 trading days, and sharply so. It is up 9.49% on the week, and 13.5% from it's low point intra-week, and stands at $8.19 right now. That means it still has a dividend yield of 4.88%. With Earnings in two weeks, share-price appreciation is sure to follow.

Second, I wished to speak about long term prospects for the stock. As you might know, the U.S. is around 4 Million Home's short of buyer demand, as home-builder hesitation over the last decade has led to a meaningful undersupply as Millennials age, and will continue to age into their prime home buying years over the next few years. (*WSJ, ""* U.S. Housing Market Is Nearly 4 Million Homes Short of Buyer Demand."" Furthermore, ""Home builders would need to construct between 1.1 million and 1.2 million single-family homes a year to meet long-term demand, but the start rate would need to be even higher to shrink the existing deficit, said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders."" Id. That means that homebuilders would need to build over 1.2 Million homes to even -start- to cut into the 4 million deficit of homes. However, fret not because...

That's because ""housing starts surged 19.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.739 million units last month."" which beat economist expectations of 1.61. (Reuters, U.S. housing starts near 15-year high; consumer sentiment rises moderately). This is as home prices in the U.S. soared 18% year-over-year in March 2021 to a median of $356,000, meaning that originations grew, and partially offset the slightly shrinking inventory and thus sales (Housingwire, ""Home prices soared in March amid record demand""). What further offsets this, is the increase in refinance and home purchase applications as rates have declined to below 3% for the first time in months. (Forbes, ""Mortgage Rates Hit Levels Not Seen In Months""). This has led to a refinance surge of 10%, and applications to purchase a home were 6%). This should allow brisk business in Q1 2021, and as refinance activity starts slowing further in the year, there should be more inventory allowing purchases to help make up the shortfall. Considering UWMC has a .15% advantage on rates, this should bode well for them.

While 2022 price increases for homes should be more subdued due to lower timber and associated materials cost, as well as more labor, they are still expected to rise. Furthermore, the purchase market is going to grow in 2021 from 2020, and beyond. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) announced today at its [**Spring Conference and Expo 2021**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3141176.t.en25.com%2Fe%2Fer%3Futm_campaign%3DMBA%2520Spring%2520Forecast%2520Release%2520-%25204-22-21%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DEloqua%26s%3D3141176%26lid%3D4748%26elqTrackId%3D370E3664A52473C73B49C93E9CDC87D2%26elq%3D25b31323597b436aac47d90e1427d551%26elqaid%3D1460%26elqat%3D1&data=04%7C01%7Cftaylor%40mba.org%7C7c50297093de479245f008d9059eadeb%7C867e5d11bde4499fb45e61572f9f337c%7C1%7C0%7C637547001352783149%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=tZj6grBtgKax8K8BkZcaUb3m%2F9NF4R4%2FoB5hFMipd44%3D&reserved=0) that purchase originations are on track to grow 16.4% to a new record of $1.67 trillion in 2021. The MBA forecasts volume to fall 14% this year to $3.28 trillion, which would still be the third-highest total ever. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are more optimistic with Fannie May Predicting $4 Trillion in Mortgage Originations in 2021, and Freddie Mac is predicting $3.5 Trillion in Mortgage Originations in 2021. With that said Fannie Mae recently revised upward from that 4 Trillion Number.

This is what Fannie Mae Predicted in their upward revised predictions:

""Consistent with a stronger home price growth forecast, the outlook for purchase mortgage originations has been boosted by $66 billion for 2021 and $84 billion for 2022 to $1.9 trillion each year compared to the March forecast. Refinance volume is unchanged at $2.1 trillion for this year and will decline 48 percent next year to $1.1 trillion, a $40 billion downward revision from the previous forecast. Around 42 percent of all outstanding mortgages have at least a 50-basis point incentive to refinance at current rates, which is down from nearly 70 percent at the end of 2020. "" -- April 16, 2021.

Finally, I expect interest rates to stay level or even dip more as people flock to TIPS- [Investors Stay Hungry for Inflation-Protected Bonds - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-stay-hungry-for-inflation-protected-bonds-11619461270) , and as foreign investors continue to purchase Treasuries (Though I am not sure how much stronger demand will be as they've already returned).

Finally, I'm going to talk about what can be expected regarding Earnings and leading up to it:

1. MSR Asset Value will increase organically as interest rates from Feb 2 were at 1.1% roughly (WSJ 10 YR Treasury Table), and have increased to roughly 1.56%. As Interest rates go up, the value of MSR's go up and this asset is continuously adjusted each quarter as a result.
2. With a Net Income of roughly 1 Billion this quarter at minimum, and a Shareholder's Equity at 2.374B, there will be a Return on Equity of 42.1% on this quarter alone, and the ROE will easily lie between 100 and 200% for FY 2021.
3. The Annual Income Yield, and the interest on the 2025 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes comes to 41.5 Million, and 81 Million Respectively. This is very, very, easily serviceable. (Class A Shares are dividend shares, where Class D stocks held by the owner are not). This is incredibly bullish, as the CEO would prefer to put the money he otherwise would have gotten back into the company to grow it. If his Class D shares were Class A shares, the Annual Dividend would be 640 Million. The Payout Ratio is still very low, but i believe their CEO would rather use the money to eat market share and grow his company rather than be issued a dividend. At least at this point in time.
4. The Senior Note Raise of 700 Million for 2029 will prove to have been a bullish indicator as you need capital to originate loans, and to secure more Mortgage Servicing Rights. The Mortgage Servicing Rights, will provide a constant stream of Cash Flow as well. The Company made over 3.38 Billion Dollars in Net Income last year, and is on pace to have a similar tally this year (Though not quite as high), because their bread and butter is purchase as opposed to refinance. Purchase's have outpaced refinance at times this year, and going forward into the second half of this year it's going to remain that way. UWMC does better in this environment, and it will be able to gain and sustain market share as a result.
5. RKT Earnings are on May 5th, and I expect a sympathy move for UWMC.
6. May 7 is when Russel Reconstitution Preliminary List comes out, and I expect UWMC will be there.
7. May 10 will be Earnings, and May 11 will be the Call with Analysts to discuss results. I think we can expect some heady things.

Position: 4,519 Shares, and 22 7.5 May 21 Contracts.",77,TLDR,Great info to remind me why I'm still bullish on UWMC and RKT. Mortgage companies are undervalued b/c people know we're in a bubble and are scared imo.,Jump the gun back when it was hot with all the DD and now i am stuck with a heavy heavy bag. :')
Fundamental analysis,stocks,What kind of fundamental analysis do you do when deciding when a company is worth it?,"I know understand the company in terms of their products, management, how they make money, etc is important but other than that, what factors do you take into consideration?",177,"Some of the advice here is pretty risky in my opinion, particularly the huge value being put on income statement lines like revenue and net income/earnings.

What I personally look at from a financial standpoint is free cash flow, adjusted for working capital effects and one-offs and take this adj. FCF/Enterprise value to get an idea of the historic return actually earned by the company. I do like a bit of debt in the EV, because if a company has a solid, recurring (and preferably growing) adj. FCF they will be able to pay down their debt if they choose to an actually reduce the EV, thus increasing the adj. FCF yield, which should lead to an increase in their market cap.

However, you have to be careful about other stuff as well. Are there any other CFs on the investment side which seem to be strangely recurring? If there are outflows, subtract them from your adj. FCF because they could be misclassified costs. Also its important to make sure that this FCF is sufficient to cover all dividends, other financing costs and share buybacks, so you know a company isn't shedding its substance like GE did for example. 

Basically, when anything is not straight forward in the way you can interpret it, take the worst interpretation of it into account.

But I also look at the income statement and balance sheet because that's where the trickery is usually hidden if a company tries to present itself in a better light (a disconnect between the adj. FCF and earnings is usually a good indicator that there's some aggressive accounting going on), because even if I like a company by their FCF, if there is some aggressive accounting in the IS & BS I wouldn't touch it, because that stuff always catches up eventually and steady earners  who have to write all their shit off and take the overdue earnings hit get punished.

Then you have the underlying business. It's a dead horse by now and everyone tells you to, but so few people actually do, but if you want to learn anything about the business: Read the 10-K and Qs. Look for changes in risk factors compared to prior Ks and Qs, Google anything that isn't immediately clear to you. Read competitors Ks and Qs as well to see how they see and frame these businesses to make sure you're not falling prey to the underlying bias where a company always looks to present itself in a better light. Listen to the calls or read the transcripts and see if there are promises being made which never materialise and disappear. 

Do not look at the presentations on their website. This is purely marketing material to sell the company to you.","Wow these comments are clueless except for the guy talking about FCF.

Focus on growth of the following:
- ROE
- FCF
- EPS
 - ROIC
- BVPS

Are all those growing consistently over time? That’s probably a solid business not going anywhere soon then.

Then check for red flags like ballooning debt or where their capex is going (maintenance or expansion), share dilution, etc","This is my due diligence check list. It helps me never question what I am supposed to do. I analyze from the top, and do the step which I feel are relevant. I'd prefer to check them all at all times but it's not always feasible.

Here is a post he did on his blog breaking down how he approached evaluting UBER, but the thought process is transferable to any business. You'll see the common theme in ""high growth"" companies is developing a narrative and defining the total addressable market. Much of a company's value is based on their future earnings, but how does one forecast that? It's certainly more than a little ""art"" and there's a wide range for error, so developing a valuation with a margin of safety (also the name of a great book) is key.

Also, he shares all his spreadsheets, which is pretty cool.

Technical analysis,stocks,Change my mind: Technical Analysis is complete bullshit,"It’s pathetic to me browsing subreddits and seeing post after post talking about how XYZ is forming a double zenith ultra harmonic convergence and is about to break out to the moon when in reality there is no merit to this “pattern”  whatsoever and the stock continues to move with randomness.

It’s even more pathetic when WSB tries to use TA, something that predicts movement based off of *patterns*, on GME, a stock that has had a completely unprecedented rise and is solely governed by sources such as news, tweets, hedge funds and market makers. 

I physically cringe anytime I see “DD” that involves a chart and every time I do see one, I instantly discredit the entire post. There have been many studies that prove the natural randomness of the stock market overshadows any patterns and predictions that could be made and your chance of predicting a stocks movement off of TA is basically that of a coin flip. Fundamental analysis, news and the current trend and sentiment of the market are infinitely more important for predicting a stocks immediate movement than TA could ever be.

The only glimmer of credibility I’d be willing to give TA is scalping but even then 90% of daytraders lose money so id say it’s not even paying off for them well in that regard either.

What it feels like to me is TA is a “noob trap” that attracts people who are new to the stock market because it makes them feel like they know what they are doing and they want an excuse to just gamble away their money. I’ve noticed a lot of YouTube channels prey off of people thinking they’re some God of the stock market for employing TA and it gives them false credibility when in reality they’re just guessing as much as anyone. Like some fake scam psychic tarot card reading shit. 

Not really looking for anyone to change my mind, I just had to get this out of my system although I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts.

Technical analysis,stocks,$BB - This Weeks Recap 3/12/2021 - Technical Analysis.," 

Happy Friday everyone!

What a god damn close. Almost hit that $12 mark but couldn't quite squeeze it out, my thanks to all of you beautiful people who bought in the last 15 minutes of trading. 3.2 MILLION shares traded in the last 15 minutes to try and reach that strike price of $12. We still have after-hours to look at, so we may actually close at or above $12. We met our max pain of $10, which is amazing. Up 23% on the week, incredible.

Thank you all for averaging down, and buying the dip. We are going to have A LOT of eyes on us this weekend and next week as well. Keep accumulating, keep holding, and let's keep the momentum up.

Let's take a quick glance at the chart, as well as options for March 19.

We are above the 50-day moving average and have just blown past a golden cross, a bullish signal.

Hourly: RSI screaming overbought. Looking like a retracement imminent.  
Bollinger bands are expanding, this is good, but we are not respecting the bands and are pressuring outside of them. Every time we've overextended the bands we retrace.  
Monday morning we might expect a gap down to correct ourselves but I will remind you that this would be a healthy retracement.  
4-hour: RSI almost overbought. A cool-off may need to happen.  
Bollinger bands slightly beginning to expand and we hugging the top. If we keep hugging the top this is good. The bands didn't get as tight as I wanted but that's okay. This could be a signal we remain moving up.

Daily: RSI smack dead in the center. Very healthy.  
Bollinger bands are contracting more and more. If they keep getting tighter and tighter we may see a massive break out in the coming days.  
4/5 days this week have been green. I like green crayons. They taste the best.  
This is the highest daily volume we've had since March 4th and before that, Feb 25th. I remind you though 3.2 million of those shares came up in the last 15 minutes of trading to try and reach that $12 strike price.

Weekly: RSI slightly to the overbought side but still moderately healthy.  
Bollinger bands are still wide.  
Our first green candle in the last 7 weeks, and it is a big one. The second-lowest weekly volume that we've had since the beginning of the year. This is huge because we don't need volume to move up. This means people are not selling and are accumulating. We know this to be true because of my previous posts of big institutions are buying.

Every whole number ($10.00, $11.00, $12.00, etc for you dingbats) will be a theoretical line of resistance we will need to push through. Each will be somewhat difficult, but not near as hard as the one I have set \~$14.44. This one was the gap-up signal to the upside and was used for the bounce on Jan 28th, acted as support on Feb 1st, and then resistance on Feb 8th. Once this is secured we will need to get past it, retest it as support, and if it acts as support this $BB will absolutely fly.

Put/Call ratio: 0.29. This is low as fuck and can be considered incredibly bullish. To be bullish, the ratio typically sits below 0.70.

The highest call open interest? 15.00 at almost 24k open contracts, second highest is $20.00 at 20k.  
The highest put open interest - 8.00 with 7k, second is 10.00 with almost 6.5k contracts.

Thats where the dead-cat/falling knife bounce happened. A lot of shares were purchased/sold at that time and it acted as resistance shortly after, and again a few days later.

Risk management,stocks,What exactly do you understand when you say 'risk management'?,"You hear lots of people saying ""you need to have proper risk management"" or ""my strategy is based on amazing risk management"". In fact, I've heard it so much that I started assuming that most people that use the phrase have no clue what they're talking about and they just wanna use fancy wording.

For me, ""risk management"" means to have a balance between risky, low/mid-cap stocks in emerging markets, stocks and established stocks that you know have a small chance of falling tremendously fast. Moreover, it means stop loss management and a bit of market timing.

Am I completely wrong? Does risk management mean something else? What does it mean for you?",4,[deleted],"It depends on what you're doing. On a position level it means ""do you have a plan in place to limit losses if the position goes worst case against you"". On a portfolio level it means ""are all you positions going to do poorly at the same time"".

If your position is long shares then having stop loss order in place isn't a bad approach, but if its a limit order and the share price blows past the limit then your order might not fill and you're stuck holding until you go in and change the limit. If it's a market order than you don't really know what price it will execute at so your risk becomes a little hazy.","To me it is synonymous with diversification.

**PROS**

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, the healthcare sector is the largest and fastest growing job segment in the US, employing over 20 million professionals in 2020. Total US employment between 2019 and 2029 is expected to grow by 15% for all healthcare professionals vs. 4% for all occupations. Men on average represented 25% of the US healthcare workforce in 2019, while men’s business represented only 17% of net revenues of 2020. In 2020, the total addressable market of the health apparel industry was an estimated $12B in the US and $79B globally, according to a Frost and Sullivan Study that FIGS commissioned. The same study says the total addressable market in the US is expected to grow by a 6.1% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the next 5 years from $12B in 2020 to approximately $16B in 2025.

FIGS sells 98% of their products through their digital platform, and leverages social media platforms to understand and better serve the community of healthcare professionals at scale. They also have an Ambassador Program ([Awesome Humans](https://www.wearfigs.com/pages/awesome-humans)), consisting of over 250 healthcare professionals from around the world, which further drives engagement with the community.  In addition to the Ambassador Program, FIGS inspires customer loyalty by building authentic relationships.  Through the #FIGSLOVE program, FIGS aims to be part of a professional's career by sending special gifts to them after career milestones like graduating from school or opening a new practice.  Among US healthcare professionals and medical students, FIGS has aided and unaided brand awareness of 55% and 22%, respectively.  From 2017 to 2020, FIGS grew net revenue from $17.6M to $263.1M with a 146% CAGR. Of the customers acquired from 2017 to 2019, approximately 50% returned for a second purchase.

&#x200B;

**CONS**

FIGS relies heavily on word-of-mouth advertising which can be a blessing and [a curse](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/15/us/figs-scrubs-video-women-do-trnd/index.html).  FIGS only recently achieved profitability and may not maintain profitability in the future. Additionally, the recent rapid growth may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth, and they expect the growth rate to ultimately slow over time. Shipping is a critical part of the business and changes can adversely affect operations.  There is reliance on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide material for and produce products which could cause problems in the supply chain.  FIGS also operates within a highly competitive market with 202 employees and [will be focused on the healthcare community](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/figs-will-focus-on-medical-scrubs-now-but-could-set-its-sights-on-other-industry-uniforms-in-the-future-11622215256) for the medium term. [Some competitors](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/figs-inc/357446828) of FIGS include:

* *Uniform Advantage*: $105M in revenue, 390 employees

* *Nixon Medical*: $82M in revenue, 400 employees
* *Barco Uniforms*: $25M in revenue, 225 employees
* *Careismatic Brands*: $221M in revenue, 730 employees

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

Given the recent IPO, I expect there to be some price movement and for it to drop in the upcoming weeks.  I will wait for a better reentry price.  With that said, healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished, resulting in highly predictable, recurring demand.  FIGS has room to grow over the next 3-5 years and I like it as a longer term investment.

Risk management,stocks,How do you manage risk in your portfolio?,"Asked this in r/investing a couple weeks ago and got a lot of good answers. Curious how the thought process here will be different with the focus on individual stocks and not just index funds.

Is there a good way to measure how risky your current portfolio is? I’ve looked at indicators like beta, sharpe ratio, and sortino ratio in the past, but I’m not sure how to actually use it to manage my portfolio.
Are there other indicators for things like interest rate risk? Or is managing risk really just about understanding the individual companies and sectors you’re invested in?

For example, I bought $TWLO at ~$80, and at one point it was one of my top performers and made up >10% of my portfolio. Now I've lost >70% on that position, and I'm kicking myself for not taking any profits off the table. Obviously hindsight is 20/20, but I'm interested in how r/stocks would have managed this position.",15,"1. Diversification ( different industries, different regions (I have 6% in Asia), some commodities (I have 2% in gold), 10-14 stocks instead of just a few )
2. Dollar cost averaging. This spreads your money out during a large period of time, so that you'll never be caught putting it all in during high points 3 times in a row.
3. Taking a value approach over just chasing growth stocks. And if you do chase growth stocks, then rebalance your portfolio with safer choices. Maybe 20% growth 80% value. Adjust it based on your risk tolerance. And remember, ""growth"" is often just an unprofitable shitty company, and ""value"" stocks can often have more growth potential.
4. Have hedges against the market. You should have holdings that beat the market when it dips. For example, insurance tends to do well during tough times and will beat the market during bear markets. Stocks like PG (but dont buy them when they're overvalued) do well because the needed products. BRK seems to be a decent hedge nowadays. Always holding a bit of gold (dalio recommends something like 2%).
5. Don't panic sell. Buy more during tough times.
6. Allocate a higher % to your top conviction picks, and a lower % to your lower conviction plays. Some people select the same % for all their picks -this makes no sense.
7. Do your research. The main thing you should learn is how to look at the company's finances, and figure out metrics like: ROIC, stock buy backs, EV/EBITDA, PE ratio, average yearly revenue or cashflow growth

Or just buy ETFs. The above is advice for individual stock holders. I'm 100% individual","imo, a significant portion of a portfolio should be in VOO, or a range of other broad ETFs, so that at least if all your picks go to shit you can come close to capturing the market return. The purpose of picking individual stocks is then 3-fold: 1) it’s super fun 2) an opportunity to put extra cash in companies you really love and believe in for the long haul and 3) the returns can potentially add on top of the overall market return.

For this reason, I hold a small number of individual names (8-12) that I can really stay on top of. Pay attention to their earnings, figure out how macroeconomics impacts each, etc. I think this approach may help you.

For example, with such constant attention given to TWLO, maybe you would have had the chance to sit down and say hey, this is significantly outpacing where I think it should be, I’m going to take a bit off the table. Or, conversely, when it drops you can fall back on the fact that you have super high conviction in the company, and this was meant to be for the long haul anyways. If nothing fundamentally has changed, don’t worry at all.",I just stay away from buying single names; I stick to ETFs. It makes the portfolio more manageable while maintaining diversification.

Risk management,stocks,Investing in developing countries and managing risks and currency volatility,"Dear Redditors,

I have a question for those of you with experience investing in stock markets of developing countries. Perhaps you reside in one of these countries and possess firsthand experience in your day trading activities. Specifically, I'm referring to countries grappling with significant inflation rates and erratic currency fluctuations. How do you perceive investing in stocks in such countries in terms of risk assessment, ranging from mild to a stay-away level?

For instance, the Argentine Peso experienced a consistent increase in exchange rates from January to mid-August, going from approximately 180 to about 280. During the same period, the MARVEL index surged from around 200k to roughly 550k, representing a gain of about 175%. However, the devaluation of the currency by the government from approximately 280 to about 350 after mid-August was far from favorable.

A similar scenario unfolded in Turkey. From July to almost the end of September, the currency depreciated from 25.80 to 27.20, indicating a 5% loss in its value. Conversely, the BIST index witnessed an upward trend, rising from about 6k to roughly 8.2k, marking a 36% increase.

In both these countries, one can observe a pattern in the exchange rate behavior where it remains steady for a while, experiences sudden spikes, plateaus, and then stabilizes for a period before spiking again. It's as if the government decides to adjust the bar a little higher one morning while sipping their coffee—of course, the reality is more complex. The point is the highly unpredictable nature of the risks involved.

[World Wrestling Entertainment](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WWE/) is defying broader market trends this year.

The company’s stock is up more than 50% in 2022, hitting a 52-week high Monday, and trading at levels it hasn’t seen since summer 2019. The S&P 500, by comparison, is down more than 20% this year.

The stock’s strong performance this year occurred as WWE’s live wrestling events business came roaring back after months of [Covid](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/) restrictions and the company increasingly became the subject of sale talks. The stock continued to do well after WWE’s longtime leader and biggest shareholder, Vince McMahon, [retired from the company](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/vince-mcmahon-retires-as-chief-of-wwe-amid-probes-into-alleged-misconduct.html) over the summer in a cloud of scandal.

Shares of WWE were effectively flat Monday after hitting $76.90. The company’s market capitalization is more than $5.6 billion.

Industry insiders believe WWE could be [an acquisition target](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/07/formula-1-wwe-ufc-potential-acquisition-targets-for-streaming-services.html). A deal could come before the company’s next U.S. TV rights renewal — likely to be announced in mid-2023. WWE’s current U.S. streaming deal with NBCUniversal’s Peacock expires in 2026.

Analyst John Healy of Northcoast Research, who covers WWE, sees the stock’s success as a confluence of successful ratings, upcoming media deal opportunities and the speculation about a possible acquisition.

“That speculation has been going on for a long time, and I think will always be around this company given the unique asset that it is and the ownership structure,” Healy told CNBC on Monday.

He also noted that WWE is relatively insulated from consumer trends, saying that “two-thirds of the revenue is coming from locked-in relationships” with media companies. Given a highly saturated media market, Healy expects high bidding for the rights to “Raw” and “Smackdown,” which are set to be renegotiated in the coming year.

WWE has also had to deal with McMahon’s controversies. He retired in July after it was revealed that he had paid nearly $20 million in previously unrecorded expenses.

Market trends,stocks,Does the average age of stock holders affect market trends?,"I am but a simple uneducated man and am just learning about personal finance and stocks in my 30s.

One random question I'm curious about stemming from this week's market downturn. Most wealth is held by Baby Boomers (I'm guessing this is true in stocks?). When the market looks like it's headed into a long-term downturn, are they more willing to sell and affect the market since they are older and cashing out their retirements? 

If true, is there any plan for this? Now that Boomers are well into retirement age, it would seem that one of the next recessions could be the last one they're willing to weather and they'll all dip out",4,"Most baby boomers are already out.  They're 70 years old and retired, or nearing retirement, so they are in risk-off mode for the most part.  So this ""sell and cash out"" thing has mostly happened with that generation already.  


Anyone who was still invested in the broader market with retirement money is probably young enough to weather this storm.",">Most wealth is held by Baby Boomers

older people tend to have more wealth, boomers or not, because they've had more time to accumulate it and peak earning years are typically the 50s. 

>When the market looks like it's headed into a long-term downturn, are they more willing to sell and affect the market since they are older and cashing out their retirements? 

potentially, but it's not like everyone is going to be selling all the same things at all the same time. a certain percentage of boomers are going to be invested more conservatively, less stocks and more bonds, so they might be doing some of the selling. 

>it would seem that one of the next recessions could be the last one they're willing to weather and they'll all dip out

anyone reaching retirement age in America today is likely to live another 20+ years. they can't all go 100% bonds. they'll need some stocks for growth over the years. and some higher-income people plan on not even using their Roth IRAs because they have no 'minimum distribution'. 401ks require you to start taking out money at a certain age, 70 or 72. but Roth IRAs have no requirement and can be used for inheritances.","Most of the wealth is held by institutions, not individuals.

Market trends,stocks,"let's be real. if a megacap stock drops 50%, 99% of y'all wouldn't touch it","It's intriguing how recent market trends, like META's dramatic drop and subsequent recovery, reflect investor psychology more than rational analysis. Earlier this year, META was trading at a 75% discount from its all-time high, and the general sentiment was overwhelmingly negative, akin to buying Blockbuster stock in 2006.

However, following its near 300% rise from that low point, perceptions have shifted drastically. This flip-flop in attitude underlines a critical aspect of investing: market sentiment is often driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. If META, or any big name for that matter, dropped by 50% again, history suggests that the majority of investors would shy away, not jump in.

This pattern is a classic example of the behavioral economics at play in the stock market, where fear and greed often override logical decision-making. It's why individual stock picking, especially based on market dips, can be so risky and unpredictable. It demonstrates the value of a more diversified, steady approach, like investing in index funds, which is likely a more suitable strategy for the majority of investors.",920,"Everyone is looking at the winners but why no one is making similar posts for losers.

To directly answer your question, right now isnt the worst time. We are coming off a deflated bubble from last year. But in no way are we ""cheap"" historically speaking. So in other words, it can go both ways but odds are, you will not get killed if you bought today.

A good metric to use is the S&P PE. You can find it here: [https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)

As you can see, we are sitting at about 19 PE which isnt horrible like during the bubbles but isnt low either. Id say its about average for the last 30 years or so. It could go down if everything goes wrong with the economy (unemployment goes way up while inflation stays way up). It can definitely go up if inflation is tackled before unemployment goes up much.

No one knows where unemployment will be by end of next year. We know jobs will be lost but its unknown if that will outweigh all the job openings that are unfilled.

Economic indicators,stocks,10% decline in cardboard box sales is a leading indicator of economic health:,"Cardboard box sales fell 9.8% last quarter according to Packing Corp. of America, the third-largest American containerboard company. This marks the 4th straight quarter of declining cardboard box sales.  
  
Cardboard box demand typically correlates with economic health, as they are used for shipping and packaging goods. More sales signal growth, while decreases suggest weakness. According to Charles Schwab's analyst Jeffrey Kleintop, the US has been in a cardboard box recession for the past year.  
  
The sales drop is the largest in over a decade, going back to 2009. The data indicates the economy remains sluggish, evidenced by reduced shipping and manufacturing needs.

Economic indicators,stocks,"Unveiling the Economic Puzzle: Change in Rate Expectations, and Economic Indicators.","Over the past two weeks, a comprehensive set of economic data has provided economists and investors with a detailed understanding of the US economy. Notably, today’s market reversal was driven by a shift in market expectations for the Federal Reserve’s target rate, presenting a challenging path forward for the stock market and raising uncertainties.

The latest labor market data revealed a hint of tepidness in the June nonfarm payrolls report. Job growth of 209,000 fell slightly below consensus expectations, and revisions showed a net gain of 99,000 jobs, signaling a slower pace compared to previous months. This suggests that the ongoing reduction in the M2 measure of money is gaining traction and beginning to impact the economy. Tight monetary policy, as a result of the Federal Reserve’s hiking cycle, is starting to have an effect.

Despite the softer labor market data, it is unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates at the upcoming July 26 meeting. Civilian employment, including small-business start-ups, rose by 273,000, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.6%. Average hourly earnings increased, and total hours worked saw an uptick, reinforcing the belief that the Fed perceives the need for further stabilization of the economy through additional rate hikes.

A divergence becomes apparent when shifting focus to the goods and services sectors. The ISM Manufacturing index continued its contraction for the eighth consecutive month, reflecting concerns about a slowing US economy and reduced customer demand. In contrast, the ISM Services index rose to 53.9 in June, with fifteen out of eighteen major industries reporting growth, surpassing even the most optimistic forecasts. While signs of a potential recession loom, the services side of the economy appears to be holding up for now, with business activity and new orders within the services sector remaining in expansion territory.

International trade data indicated a decline in the trade deficit for goods and services to $69.0 billion in May, accompanied by decreases in both imports and exports. This aligns with forecasts of a recession, reflecting weakened domestic demand for goods and a shift towards increased spending on services. Import numbers from China have plummeted by 24.3% compared to the same period last year, resulting in China slipping to the third-largest exporter to the US behind Mexico and Canada. Falling daily freight rates further indicate a weakened global trade environment.

The most significant market impact today was driven by new expectations for the Federal Reserve’s target rate. The provided data reveals an increasing probability, now at 92.4%, of the target rate falling within the 525-550 basis points range. This shift in rate expectations has led investors to reassess their strategies and pricing models, incorporating the potential impact on various asset classes.

Though rates off recent highs, this week's still-large backup in yields reflects fears of a more aggressive Fed and continued global tightening (though market pricing continues to forecast only a single July rate hike before the Fed pauses).

Considering the implications for the stock market, the outlook appears uncertain. The ongoing slowdown in the goods sector, coupled with reduced demand and inventory buildup, raises concerns about future factory output. Persistent inflationary pressures, as indicated by the prices index within the manufacturing sector, pose challenges for companies.

As the market adjusts to shifting rate expectations and economic indicators, caution should be exercised. The stock market may face downward pressure as it navigates these uncertainties, potentially impacting company valuations and investor sentiment. Market participants are urged to closely monitor developments, adapt investment strategies accordingly, and remain diligent in risk management.

The message the world’s top central bankers delivered late last month could not have been clearer. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, and his US and eurozone counterparts Jay Powell and Christine Lagarde, all insisted that high inflation — and high interest rates — would endure.

The impact of the shifting economic landscape and changing rate expectations will mainly impact cyclical stocks, stocks particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations.

* There is so much data and so many indicators to gauge how the economy is doing
* But, the data has so much noise and many caveats (*data isn't timely, flaws in how the data is collected & measured, not actionable to connect-the-dots on what I should be doing as an investor*)
* I've had to deal with similar issues as a Finance Manager who needs to report to the C-Suite and investors on how we're doing with the business. We have so much data and the same problems with our data, but how do we use this data to make actionable & swift decisions? 
* Using a similar philosophy, I identified 5 economic indicators that help me quickly & sufficiently gauge how the economy is doing and help me connect-the-dots on what I should be doing as an investor. 
* This is what I found helpful, but love to see your comments on what economic indicators make you a better investor 

&#x200B;

**1. Jobs Report**

* **Why:** The North Star for me is that my companies should be delivering strong results if people are employed, making money, and spending their money on goods & services that my company provides. Low unemployment, strong job creation, and a tight labor market quickly signals to me my companies should continue to do well with a firm economy.
* **What I look for**: I'm very focused on the unemployment rate (*3.6%*), number of jobs created (*+390K*), and the labor force participation rate (*62.3%*). The labor market is strong which is great for my companies , but my longer-term outlook for unemployment (*4.0% - 5.0%*), job creation (*+100K*), and LFPR (*\~60%*) is softer to align with demographic trends.
* **Where:**  [Employment Situation - 2022 M05 Results (bls.gov)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm) 

&#x200B;

**2. Jobless Claims**

* **Why:** I really like to get a weekly Thursday update on how many people are filing for unemployment so I can get timely & high-frequency update on how the labor market is doing. A strong labor market is very important so my companies can sustain demand and deliver strong results.
* **What I look for**: The pre-COVID average is 218,000 claims so anything below or around this level means the labor market is strong and gives me an indicator that the monthly jobs report should be strong as well.
* **Where:**  [News Release (dol.gov)](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) or find the unemployment insurance weekly claims report here [News Releases | U.S. Department of Labor (dol.gov)](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases)

&#x200B;

**3. Materials released from the Federal Reserve like FOMC Projections, FOMC Minutes, FOMC Announcement, and Fed Chair Press Conference**

* **Why:** They're professional economists, have more resources, and connections than I do to understand how the economy is doing & where it's going. I learn a lot from their expertise and try to make sure I'm on the same page on my understanding of the economy so I know where monetary policy and interest rates are going.
* **What I look for**: My favorite thing to look for is their FOMC projections since they share their forecasts for economic growth (*\~2%*), unemployment rate (*\~4%*), inflation (*\~2% in the long-term*), and interest rates (*another 175 bps by the end of the year*). 
* **Where:**  [The Fed - Meeting calendars and information (federalreserve.gov)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) 

&#x200B;

**4. Inflation**

* **Why:** The Federal Reserve looks at inflation to determine if interest rates should go up or down. If inflation is too high, the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates, tighten monetary policy, and will negatively impact stock prices regardless of how well my companies perform.
* **What I look for**: I look at PCE since the Federal Reserve wants that to average around 2.0% for stable inflation and I also look at CPI. CPI is available earlier than PCE and has recently been **\~2pp** higher than PCE. I expect PCE to be **\~6.6%** for May '22 since CPI for May '22 was **8.6%**. Not good compared to the Fed's target of \~2.0% for inflation.
* **Where:**  [CPI Home : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (bls.gov)](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) 

&#x200B;

**5. GDP from the Atlanta Fed**

* **Why:**  Strong business activity in a country translates to higher profits for my companies. It's an important metric as an investor for that reason, but low on my list because GDP released from the BEA isn't timely at all (*it's released quarterly*), I'm already making decisions as an investor way after this is released, and there are a lot of noisy components that affects the headline number that has no impact on my companies. That's why I like to see the real-time GDP forecast from the Atlanta Fed since their model is built similarly to how GDP is measured and the model really helps me understand how numerous data points that are released over time will impact GDP like home sales, manufacturing indexes, and other data points that are tough to make investment decisions on their own.
* **What I look for**: In the past, this has generally been around **1.5% - 2.0%**. I expect that to stay in the same in the long-run given demographic & productivity trends.
* **Where:**  [GDPNow - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow?panel=4)",96,interest rate is one. War is also very important.,"Edit: sorry - my sub is r/stockpreacher You're welcome to join as long as you aren't a dick.

Economic indicators,stocks,[Forbes] Are we in a recession?,"Experts have been talking about a U.S. recession for close to a year now, but with no official announcement, the debate continues. Here is an update based on the most recent economic reports to help better understand where the economy currently sits and if a recession is still on the horizon.

**Definition of a recession**

A drop in output across all leading economic indicators defines a recession. More specifically, if employment levels drop, consumer spending decreases and industries don't produce as much as they did previously. These areas of economic activity have to be in a long-term decline for there to be an official call, a definitive recession.

Even though the final monthly and quarterly numbers of these activities are used to determine a recession, they're not always representative of the state of the economy. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the agency that calls a recession whenever it notes that economic indicators are showing continued signs of a slowdown.

In the past, the NBER would call a recession after two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP). What makes things different this time is that other economic indicators still showed strength during the same contraction period. This forced the NBER to reassess.

There’s been eviction moratoria in various forms in the US for nearly a year now, and the numbers of people delinquent in either are rising.  Yet the market keeps going up even in retail companies.  We’re seeing a dip right now due to various things like rising bond yields, stimulus package wavering and negotiation, trade wars in semiconductors leading to a knock-on effect of decreased production in automotive, and Asian and European markets having their own issues.  Meme stocks are still flailing about with strange correlations not just to each other, but with the market overall (there’s something here that also concerns me, but that’s for another post).

Since a lot of income and spending numbers are relative to GDP, we can see that there was a massive drop Q2 2020, and regained only 34% of that drop in the following quarter.  We haven’t recovered that initial drop yet, not by a long shot.  Q4 didn’t help much. [(source)](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)

These articles and more all have the same theme:  people are behind on home payments, even if only partially.

There’s also a persistent expectation of loss of employment income with [this US Census survey](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?mapPeriodSelector=14&barChartPeriodSelector=14&mapAreaSelector=st&barChartAreaSelector=st) with weekly data for 24 weeks (raw data available for download).  There’s a nice map there that breaks things down by state and by metro area.  A common theme here is large non-farm employment hubs like L.A., Miami, New York, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, San Diego, and Nevada (where I suspect Las Vegas and Reno are getting hit hard since they’re heavy tourism and service sectors).  These expectation percentages are large in leading metro areas.

There’s [this January 2021 survey](https://www.blackknightinc.com/black-knights-first-look-at-january-2021-mortgage-data/) on mortgage data that appears mixed.  Two bullet points demonstrate this:

> The national mortgage delinquency rate fell to 5.9% in January, dropping below 6% for the first time since March 2020

> At the current rate of improvement, 1.8 million mortgages will still be seriously delinquent at the end of June when foreclosure moratoriums on government-backed loans are currently slated to lift

A large concern is the moratorium extension Biden issued on January 21st.  The extension moves the expiration from March 31st to June 31st.  The reason it’s a concern is because it’s only for mortgages, not also rent.

> The White House said the extended protections are in part aimed at prioritizing communities of color hit hardest by the pandemic. Homeowners of color make up a disproportionate share of the home owners with delinquent loans or on forbearance plans. 

> However, Tuesday's actions did not address the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's federal moratorium on evictions for not paying rent. That moratorium is also set to expire March 31. About one-third of all Americans, roughly 107 million people, are renters. [(source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/16/mortgage-relief-ban-home-foreclosures-extended-joe-biden/6755036002/)

We keep pushing these quarterly moratoria out by one quarter, and I’m not sure what politicians are expecting to happen inside three months that will address this situation to a sufficient degree.  Debt is debt, and people getting their jobs back doesn’t mean that debt goes away instantly.  

The service sector is the largest non-farm sector in the US economy by employment [(source)](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm).  That sector has also gotten kicked square in the balls by the pandemic.  The fact that the service sector pays crap to most of its employees means that they have a really hard time building up emergency funds and are therefore likely to be small.  With an extended period of reduced wages or just plain unemployment means that most of those emergency funds will have likely been drained by now.

That’s a long way of saying there are lots of low-income folks on the edge of eviction with no help whatsoever in sight.  From the Bloomberg article above on February 8, 20201: 

> Some 9.3 million jobs were lost last year and the U.S. suffered the sharpest rise in the poverty rate since the 1960s.

Bash a bear all you want, I don’t see any other interpretation of this data other than politicians refusing to defuse a massive economic time bomb.

That does not mean that there won’t be growth in sectors.  I just don’t like the fact that I just now seriously considered for a few minutes getting into a payday loan ETF (they’ve somewhat flatlined, which I’m actually thankful for, maybe due to various state-level legislation in recent years limiting their collective growth potential).

If [current monetary policy](https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0Ex6kAKAoFRsFh6M/200.gif) was to avoid a crash in March 2020, they succeeded.  I’m no economist, so I can’t critique one way or the other if it was the smart thing to do, but we can’t deny the effects that it’s going to have:  increased inflation.  It’s possible that the intent was to turn a crash into inflation which the Fed can manage better, but it’s not clear if really they just dumped money into the economy only to save the stock market with near complete disregard for the long-term effects.  We’ve heard JPow say their policy has been adjusted inflation targets to *average* 2% per year, but naturally that implies at least one year of > 2% inflation, likely more.  If an economist or two can lend some insight here as to their intent and potential mitigation strategies, it would be extremely helpful.  I worry that the party will be over when they transition to finite QE.

The picture is far more complex than these statistics.  As far as calling this DD, it’s incomplete, but I’m posting it here to get a more in-depth conversation started.  There are gaps to fill, statistics to clarify, and simply just more research that needs to be done to get a better picture.

Personally, I’m not doing this to profit on what could be a gut punch followed by a long, slow bleed.  I want to have hard data to present to my representatives and tell them what areas need fixing.  The only thing I can think of is blanket federal support for gradual home payment debt assistance, but a more thorough examination of our current status is needed before I go to my reps with such a heavy-handed solution.",8,"You’re not off-base here. This has been a major concern of mine for some time. Two points I’ll bring up:

1.  Most of the people who are behind on mortgage payments will be able to work things out with their lenders. Lenders don’t want to foreclose on a property unless absolutely necessary. I personally think that a lot of the people behind on their mortgage will negotiate plans to tack on their missed payments to the end of their mortgage (essentially just extending the term of the loan). This won’t help people who rent, but I do think it will help reduce the risk of a flood of home foreclosures.

2.  I understand that investing in payday lenders can be profitable, but I’m begging anyone reading not to do so. I’m not too big on ESG, but payday lenders are the scum of the earth and do not deserve to have capital allocated to them. They are just as bad as Russian mercenary companies and private prisons.",[deleted],"Not a financial advisor yadda yadda. 

I am a commercial lender. I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around what's going on. I happen to deal with a lot of people with large portfolios of rental properties - both apartments and SFRs and to a lesser extent commercial properties. Across their portfolios they are collecting rent like COVID hasn't been an issue. Also, basically non existent vacancy rates. Past due levels across our bank are crazy low.  I'm sure it has a lot to do with things being pretty good where I'm at regarding unemployment, etc. But still no real warning signs going off. 

Lending in general is competitive but I'm not seeing overly risky deals being made in the market. Rates are low and terms are generous. If you want business it is at low profit margins.

My fear, if you want to call it that, with the economy is that we are basically in a forever low rate environment. People have been conditioned to low rates. If a big hiccup comes along and rates go up people don't necessarily have the cash flow to cover it. We have been underwriting deals for basically the last 10 years based on minimum coverage ratios and consumer transactions on DTIs, with extremely low historical rates. People have gotten used to that and use the extra cash flow they were paying in interest expense to buy cars/boats/vacations etc and stimulating the economy. A rise in rates brings all of that to a halt. 

Our economy is also largely tied to construction and real estate. Right now we are seeing home prices appreciating and people are able to afford the mortgages on homes because the rates are low. With rates going up and home prices increasing its going to slow the real estate market. Homes are getting more expensive to build by the day so prices can't be cut to offset the rise in rates. At the same time inventory levels are low right now so people are going to keep buying, at least for awhile. But if rates are higher and cost is higher then people will have to cut back somewhere to afford it. Reducing their consumption. 

I watched a bit of a webinar yesterday where a guy was talking about expectations for mortgage rates, economy, inflation, etc. He said we can expect rates to increase for the near term before the Fed steps in with something akin to Operation Twist to pull long term rates down. We are bound to see inflation show up in the next couple of months because it is calculated based on a rolling 12 months. In March and April last year we saw negative inflation. As those months get rolled off it has to go up before settling back down.

Costs are definitely goin up, so there is undoubtedly inflation out there. At the same time wages year over year are up and our govt is flooding the system with money. And looks like it will continue to be trickled in over time with the current stimulus package and a likely future infrastructure deal. 

In my opinion at all costs rates have to be kept low. Not sure how that can be done long term but I'm also not convinced we can handle rising rates. 

To be frank I'm also worried about us pumping so much money into the system and what will happen with taxes. I think we will see a lot of cities facing debt issues due to tax collection issues. 

Who knows?"
Economic indicators,stocks,"Nobel Economist Paul Krugman says the economy is doing better than people think and ""those recession calls were clearly a false alarm""","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/paul-krugman-economy-nyt-recession-unemployment-growth-2023-5

Americans are still fretting over a potential recession, but the economy is actually faring much better than most people think, according to Nobel economist Paul Krugman.

In an op-ed for the New York Times on Monday, Krugman pointed to widespread pessimism about the US economy, despite indicators that show economic activity is fairly healthy.

Though 93% of CEOs expect the economy to tip into a recession within the next 18 months, according to the Conference Board's latest survey, Krugman noted that the job market is the strongest it's been in decades, with the US adding 6 million jobs since December 2021. The unemployment rate has also dropped to its lowest level since the 1960s, while job satisfaction is at an all-time-high.

And while inflation was a top concern for Americans in 2022, prices have been coming down for much of the past year, cooling to 4.9% in the April Consumer Price Index report. That's over 500 basis-points lower from where prices where in June 2022, when inflation notched a 41-year-high of 9.1%.

""The interesting question now is why, at least according to some surveys, the public remains very negative on the economy – as negative as it has been in the past amid severe economic downturns – even though those recession calls were clearly a false alarm, and the economy is actually looking remarkably strong,"" Krugman said. 

Markets grew particularly skittish about recession risks last year when the US slipped into a technical recession defined by two straight quarters of negative GDP growth.

But official recessions are declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which uses other data to determine if the US is truly in a recession. So far, those other indicators say that it is not, Krugman said. 

He speculated that the gloomy outlook on the economy stemmed from Americans who were assuming others were facing economic difficulties, though most people themselves are still dealing with upbeat personal fortunes. The odds of a future recession have also been widely publicized through media reports, which could be creating a negative bias.

""While many Americans tell surveys that things are terrible – which says something about how people respond to surveys and where they get their information, this doesn't contradict positive assessment,"" Krugman added.

Still, other experts have warned a downturn is still possible this year as the Fed signals it will keep interest rates high. Bank of America strategists said a downturn could start as soon as this quarter, judging by a notorious bond market indicator that predicted the recessions of 1990, 2001, and 2008.",726,isn’t he the guy who is always wrong on an almost jim cramer level?,Krugman got roasted in the comments section of the NY Times.   He was lambasted as an affluent professional who is not in touch with ordinary people who can't afford to buy food and pay the rent.,"Everybody expected a recession. It’s been what, 2 years now? 

Nobody has a crystal ball but if I were to take a guess, a recession would be quite a surprise after some sort of rally."
Economic indicators,stocks,Anyone else think we’ll be below 2020 prices soon?,"Although most stocks are down pretty hard right now I’m wondering what the general sentiment is about a continuing decline? 
2020 was the pinnacle of cheap rates, free money, and artificial Covid growth. I’m wondering how much true growth has taken place since 2020 and if prices accurately reflect that. Considering the last two years we’re propped up and the economic indicators for the next two years are negative I’m thinking we could break late 19, early 20 prices?

Defensive stocks have a chance of avoiding that steep of a decline. I think most commodities have a good chance too.

Economic indicators,stocks,Current positive economic indicators,"I'm seeing a lot of market pessimism on this sub lately. 99% of the reasoning that comes with this pessimism usually has to do with Trump. Well, guess what, after every presidential election about 49% of the country disagrees with the outcome, this isn't a new thing. The market may make short term jumps up or down based on politics, but the real bread and butter of the markets is the economy, and I believe that right now the economy is stronger than ever, thus supporting the ever continuously rising markets.

First, the S&P P/E ratio. This ratio takes the price of the S&P and divides it by the collective earnings of the stocks within the S&P. It works as an overbought/oversold indicator much like it does on individual stocks. Currently it's ~25, which is maybe ""slightly"" high but it is nothing close to estimating that recession is coming.

Economic indicators,stocks,"Many indicators are suggesting a recession in the near future, what's your opinion?","The yield curve

At the point of closing on Friday, the US treasury bond yield curve is slightly inverted between the 7 and 10, besides the slight inversion the yield curve is generally extremely flat pointing at a high probability for a weak economy in the future if not a recession. The yield curve flattening started already last year but became recently only flatter. The yield curve inversion is known to be a very accurate predictor of recessions.

The eurodollar futures curve 

The eurodollar futures curve, which is a bet on the 3 months libor, started inverting already early last December and is currently inverted from the Dec. 2023 contract. The inversion is only becoming deeper in the later contracts and suggests that there is a high probability that the economic situation in the near future will be such, that the FED will be forced to stop hiking rates, or even has to lower the rates again. The eurodollar futures curve is also an accurate indicator for recessions and predicted the reaction of the Fed for the GFC as well as March 2020

The rising dollar 

Since the lows about one year ago, the US dollar is rising rapidly on the DXY. It is already very close to multi year highs and if it keeps it's momentum we could see levels not seen since 20 years. A rising dollar suggests an illiquid dollar shortage situation which isn't any good for the economy. 
https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy/charts

The rising oil price

I think this one doesn't need much explanation, but if the oil price it too high it will damage the economy because it will squeeze out the budget of the people causing to less economic activity for anything else. A quickly rising oil price is associated with recessions and this time the oil price is definitely rising very quickly. 
https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/


High CPI prints

Similar to high oil prices, if the CPI rises quickly without similarly high rising wages across all income classes, the people will be squeezed out in their spending for other stuff and services, which is bad for the economy. 
https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm

I think that's not even everything, but at least an overview of important and usually very accurate indicators pointing towards a recession. It's also very interesting, that all the above mentioned indicators were pointing in to the bad direction far before Russia started the war and the west reacted with sanctions, implying that the situation was developing badly independently from the war. Obviously the war on the top makes things only worse.

stock,stocks,Shouldn't the Nvidia stock be skyrocketing?,"Gamer here, live in a basement, play games 24/7, don't have money, don't own stocks.

But I do know what the stock market is.

So here is my question: *why on earth isn't the Nvidia stock going up and up until there is quite literally not enough money in any investor's pocket anymore to buy another share?*

Do the people with money not understand what's going on? Nvidia has 0 competition and every single one of the richest people on earth is buying as many GPUs as they can, probably paying double/triple to get their hardware delivered first. This is happening right now as we speak.

Sooooooo ... uhm ... do only people that game 24/7 actually get what the AI revolution entails? Isn't it obvious? Are nerds with 10+ years of ""experience"" in their field the only people that can actually tell what's happening? Like do I have to be a hobby pilot for 10 years to see when a revolutionary invention is happening in the aerospace industry? Is everyone else blind to that? I'm confused. Do people always think they are being tricked when it comes to stocks? You could have had a nerdy friend working in machine learning and he could have told you everything that's going down now back in 2019.

If I understand this correctly, then the only reason Nvidia stock isn't rising every week is because people think they are being tricked by nerdy gamers?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Alright, thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts! Really appreciate it. To wrap up, here's a summary of the reasons why Nvidia stock isn't continually rising:

* People only trust their own eyes. Which I think is fair. I could sit here forever explaining how the AI revolution will play out and people would still wait until they can actually feel the impact themselves. For example, in the next 4 weeks, ChatGPT will roll out an image creator. A large amount of normies will absolutely love that feature. Normie subs to ChatGPT -> normie loves it -> normie understands Nvidia hardware is driving it -> normie invests -> stock rises. That's the only way it happens. No reddit post can compete with that.
* Supply. Nvidia just can not keep up with the orders. The demand is wayyy higher than the supply. And this isn't changing anytime soon. Takes forever to build these factories.
* Ursula got wind of the numbers Nvidia is crankin' out and is preparing a 4 billion fine for being smarter than the competition.
* Geopolitical uncertainties.

TSLA -2.44%▼ stock in recent days, regulatory disclosures show, just months after saying he wasn’t planning to sell additional shares in the company.

Mr. Musk sold around 7.9 million shares between Friday and Tuesday, regulatory filings show.

stock,stocks,Tesla stock pops after plans to enable another stock split,"Shares of shot up Monday, after the electric vehicle giant disclosed plans to enable a stock split, which would be the second in two years.

The company TSLA, -0.32% said in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will ask shareholders to approve an increase in the number of shares outstanding. The request will be made at its 2022 annual shareholders meeting expected in October.

The stock rallied 5.8% in premarket trading, putting them on track to open at the highest price seen during regular-session hours since Jan. 13. It slipped 0.3% on Friday to close at $1,010.64, to snap an eight-day winning streak. Monday’s rally comes even after a report that Tesla will pause production in China amid new COVID-19 lockdowns.

Tesla had 1.033 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31. In the 2021 proxy statement, the company said it is authorized to have 2.00 billion shares outstanding.

The company’s only other stock split, a 5-to-1 split, took effect on Aug. 31, 2020. At that time, the stock was trading at a pre-split-adjusted price of about $2,213. The stock closed Aug. 31 at split-adjusted $498.32.

To lower the stock price to around that level, Tesla would have to increase number of shares it is authorized to have outstanding by more than 1 billion, so it could enact a 2-for-1 split. To match the previous 5-for-1 split, the number of authorized shares outstanding would have to increase by more than 3 billion.

Although a stock split doesn’t change anything about a companies fundamentals, it has historically helped boost the stock price as it is viewed as a sign of management’s confidence that the stock will continue to perform well, as Mark Hulbert has written for MarketWatch.

Tesla’s stock had soared 78% from the time the company said after the Aug. 11 close that it approved a 5-for-1 stock split through Aug. 31, but then fell 33.7% over the next week. The stock didn’t close back above the Aug. 31 closing price until Nov. 19.

Tesla’s stock has lost 4.4% year to date through Friday, but has soared 63.4% over the past 12 months. In comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.51% has gained 14.3% over the past year.

trade,stocks,What $GME has taught me in 36 hours of day trading,"Jumped on the $GME bandwagon on Friday, 4 @ \~316. My 36 hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out, I will never YOLO on a bubble ever again.

The principle seemed straightforward: hedge funds got lazy/greedy, over-shorted their positions, bet against a company that wasn't actually going under, and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze. Even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market, the basic premise makes sense. But the devil's in the details, and hype is blinding.

First red flag was when I realized [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) did not bet on the short squeeze, he bet on undervalued stock price *over a year ago*. He has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze, he walks away with 8 figures. So the people screaming ""if he's still in, I'm still in!"" and ""look at those brass balls, if he can lose $5MM in a day then I can hold"" are really living up to the dumb ape meme. He didn't lose $5MM yesterday, he lost $5MM in \*unrealized gains\*, there is a \*huge\* difference.

Second red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds won't go down without a fight, and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience. You don't get that without learning how to game the system in complex, subtle ways. So even if they are still heavily shorted (which they might not even be anymore), and even if somehow [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them, that doesn't rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about.

But even in the off chance that somehow this turns around, and $GME does go ""to the moon,"" that doesn't change the fact that it's bad long-term strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons. They almost certainly fail, and if they don't, they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble. I'm still holding my shares but I don't expect to see my \~$1200 ever again. In the off chance I break even or see a profit here, I will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains.

**Edit:** holy shit RIP my inbox. No way I can read all that.

Want to clarify a few things. Not financial advice.

**My position:** I knew I was late to the party. I *wanted* to gamble. I knew what I was doing, and (mostly) why I did it. Hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than I wanted to admit, but still, I'm not surprised by the outcome so far, and I'm totally OK with taking the L and calling it a lesson learned. I don't blame DFV, WSB, or anyone for my choices. I own them, even proudly, because I wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs. sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss. I'm holding because I already bought my tickets to this ride, want to see this thing play out, and I'm fine with gambling the final $300 on the outside chance things turn around.

**Your positions:** brothers, sisters, nonbinary siblings: **you are not your portfolio**. whether up or down, your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is. you are a human being on the bleeding edge of 3.5 BILLION years of evolution, you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than you'll ever know. 12 years ago I was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on 211 Steel Reserve. I hit my bottom, joined AA, and now I'm a network engineer, wife, kids, the whole lot. Anything is possible if you don't give up on yourself. But I know it's not that easy, we all need borrowed self-esteem before we can see the real value inside. So if this $GME gamble hit you hard, please reach out to someone. don't give up. Hell, this bubble isn't even over, it might even turn around! But either way, don't give up.

**Edit2:**

wow, never expected this to go this far. wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation. read a ton of replies, probably missed most of them. thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween! A few more points:

* Agreed that RH deserves to be held accountable. No question they manipulated this.
* Agreed it's not over yet. the squeeze could happen. but if it does, **my** main personal takeaway from this experience will stand: I won't speculate on bubbles anymore. This is my position if I lose everything or make $100k.
* if you posted gains, that's awesome! so glad for you, I wish you the best!

**Edit3 2/3/21:**

Full disclosure, I closed my position this morning at a \~$900 realized loss.

My gut says the squeeze happened, short interest isn't what I thought it was on Friday, and the stock will return to actual value soon.

**Edit4 2/25/21:**

**I stand by my decisions, both to buy and to sell. I don't speculate on bubbles. Period. But you can do whatever the fuck you want with your money and you'll never find me shaming you about it.**",26717,"Unlike most - I actually watched most of DFV's videos. He was never bettering on the short squeeze.  He was campaigning for GME being around for much longer.

WSB was shitting all over him when he was posting his losses, up until he started making great profit. That's when they all started calling him their God.","Another good lesson that you performed is to never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially on a risky play. By going in with just 4 @ $316, it's easier to look at things from a more objective lens and not fall prey to the hopes, hypes, and hysteria when the price swings big.

I'm in the same boat as you, and I'm taking this as a very educational week.",The biggest winner in this whole farce is AMC. The company literally got $600m for free without doing anything.
trade,stocks,This killed day trading for me..,"I haven't told hardly anyone this because it kills me to think about.  I had started day trading paper stocks. I was reading day trading books by reputable day traders, watching live YouTube traders and actually was doing pretty good. In 1 year, I had turned the original 10,000 paper money I started with into 140,000. It was like I couldn't lose. For every red day, I had 3 green days. I was doing everything by the book and it was really working.  
   
   So, not having any money, I took out a personal loan for 5k. Put 2k in the bank and 3k into my day trading platform. I was so confident in myself that i laughed when the loan guy told me 5 years at 23%. I told him I'd pay it off in full within 6 months. 

   Now in day trading they teach you to look for a catalyst. A reason why a stock will go up. They also teach you to set a stop loss at no more than 5% so you don't lose everything if it drops. Well I started day trading for real and was doing only ok. I would make 250 dollars then lose 150 dollars. Lose 300 then make 200. I was about 50/50 red days and green days. My 3k was down to about 2,800 after a week. Then it happened.  I read a stock twit at 5am about a small company that just had their product approved to sell on Amazon. I looked it up and it was true. I told myself I would buy 2k worth. When I looked up the price, it was only .88 a share!

   The bell rings and I buy like 2,200 shares. It instantly goes up about 6 percent and I'm getting excited. Then, literally as I'm setting my stop loss (not even 2 minutes into the session) it drops. Alot. Below where my stop was gonna be set. I'm down 100 so I'm like we'll shit. I go to set another stop but it falls so fast that I can't set it in time. I'm down 200 then 300 then 400 and I'm freaking out. I finally set a stop and it sells immediately for a 400 dollar loss. This was the first 5 minutes of the session. Over the next 20 minutes it dropped to .40 a share. I thought well at least I got out before it went that low. Upset and confused about why it would fall so low on positive news, I Ieft to work. I had about a 35 min drive and decided about 10 mins into it to check on that stock. It was 2.50 a share! The app for the particular platform at the time was only for checking stocks, I could not perform any buy/sell action from the app and I was driving to work. I checked again 10 mins later, it was at 4.50 a share! I got to the supply house about 20 mins later and checked while I was waiting on parts. 7.00 a share. I couldn't stop watching it all day so when the market closed and it was at 12.35 a share I literally felt sick. The next day it fell a bit early but then ended at 17 dollars! 

   Over the next two weeks it had massive swings but hit a high of 34 dollars a share. Now I don't know if I would have held it to that point but I beat myself up for months thinking I lost 400 dollars when I could have made 60k. It completely killed my spirit. I started sucking at my trades. It only took a few months and another almost 2k in losses for me to lose all motivation and pull out my 600 bucks I had left and put it in a different stock trading account, close my day trading account and completely lose all confidence in my ability to day trade.

   They say 84% of day traders claim a loss at the end of the year. I guess I was part of that statistic. I went from being on cloud 9 with my paper account for a year, just slaying the market to being completely shut down in just a few months. Every time someone brings up ""yo man, you still doing the day trading thing"" I just lie and tell them no I don't have enough time to dedicate to it anymore. But really I think of the perfect trade that I knew would go up, that I sold for a loss and, unable to do anything, I watched it go up 3,500% and it still makes me physically queasy. This was 4 years ago. I am what they call in the business an emotional trader. Just thinking of day trading for real money now actually gives me anxiety. Thanks for reading my story. 100% true btw. Nothing in this is made up or exaggerated. Real prices, real time frames. I just can't remember the ticker. 
 
   It ended up falling to about 3 or 4 dollars a share over the next year, and yes I watched it for the next year but 2k into 26k in one day would have been great. 2k into 35k the next day would have been better.  Turning it into 60k would have been life changing for me at that time but I think what hurts the most is that I found that obscure twit. I did the research. I truly believed it would go up, I knew it would go up. Then I panic sold my perfect trade that was truly perfect. Thats worse than losing the money.


EDIT: ok so I found the stock ticker!!!..I was able to log into my tc2000 account from my browser and look at my trade history. it was OBLN. I had trouble finding a chart for it for some reason but I did find one. The prices are totally different than what they were that day. They must have had some splits or reverse splits or something. 

   I also got a couple details wrong. I didn't buy 2,000 shares. That was actually a different stock. I yolo'd my whole 3,000 dollars and bought 3,448 shares at .87 each on May 23, 2019. Another detail I got wrong, It wasn't almost 4 years ago it was almost 3 years ago. I sold 2 minutes later at .57 a share. It wasn't a 400 dollar loss, it was a 600 dollar loss. According to the only chart I could find that recognized the ticker symbol, on May 23, 2019 it opened at 20.40, hit a high of 28.20, a low of 18.90 and closed at 20.40 a share, exactly the same as the open. Totally different than what my trade history says. There are some other weird things about this stock besides having trouble finding a chart. On tc2000 it is now listed as OBLN.OLD Also, my trade history is wonky and not correct. I bought all those shares, watched it drop and sold them. Then watched the price skyrocket for the rest of the day. According to Tc2000, I bought 3,448 shares at .87 which is correct but then it says I sold them all 2 minutes later for .84. This is not correct. It also shows me buying 4,000 shares the next day at .57, then selling 3,000 21 minutes later for .55 then selling the other 1,000 17 minutes after that for .57. None of that happened. I never traded it a second day. I bought at .87 then sold a few minutes later at either .55 or .57. It was one transaction on one day. Tc2000 was always a little funky and I grew to not like it all. I'm sure since the chart and my numbers do not match there will still be people saying I'm lying or this is fake or whatever. If those people would like, I can send them screen shots of my buy at .87 on the same day that the chart says it was 20.40. I wish it matched but I currently have both up on my computer and I can send them. I don't understand it either. But I found the ticker!!! Yea!",2008,Biggest mistake was trading money that wasn't yours. That makes your trades much more emotional.,Stocktwits is manipulative pump garbage. Stay off of there and find another source of leads.,"If you sold at the top and netted 60k it probably would have stoked your confidence and made you more comfortable taking on even riskier behavior and exposing yourself to even greater downsides.  Just some food for thought.  Lack of sustainability is a key feature of day trading.

trade,stocks,Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653

Hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers’ actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found

Thousands of officials across the government’s executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.

More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.

A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.

The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.

The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren’t available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.


Among the Journal’s findings:

• While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

• More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.

• More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.

• At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.

• About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.

• When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency’s work.
Number of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks, 2016-21

Federal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield “immense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,” said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.

He said many of the examples in the Journal analysis “clearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public’s confidence in the integrity of the government.”

Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. “The buck stops with the official,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. “It’s the official who could benefit or be harmed…. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.”

Investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.

Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.

This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.

U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.

The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges.

Most officials’ financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.

Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven’t turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn’t provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)

Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren’t considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn’t restrict investing in diversified funds.

Some federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is “committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government,” said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.

At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump’s pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.

Mr. Molina’s job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He “reviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,” said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a “personal and confidential representative” of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.

In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.

Reported trades in energy and mining firms;

made by spouse through a financial adviser

The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband’s account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.

Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don’t conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal’s review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.

In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn’t know much about the energy trades. “I can say this on the record: I didn’t even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,” he said.

In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.

In about 2½ years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina’s disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.

In the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.

Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.

After publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: “Neither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‘pool’ of several dozen clients—not for us individually.”

Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency’s ethics office “counseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.” EPA officials signed Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.

U.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.

The EPA doesn’t have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren’t working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina’s boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.

Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department’s director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.

Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias’s portfolio.

Mr. Zacharias’s office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn’t attend those meetings.

In an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn’t involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. “I could always walk downstairs and ask them how it’s going. But that really wasn’t an interest of mine,” he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.

Mr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn’t pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: “I’m just the pipe-smoking science guy.”

The Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal’s analysis.

“I apologize that things don’t look good on the buy side,” Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: “I just decided that would be a good investment at the time.”

He said ethics officials didn’t raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be “a little tighter.”

A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias “worked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.” She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees’ disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.

Some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies’ misunderstanding of their own rules.

The FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are “significantly regulated” by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.

An FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.

Mr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA’s planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.

Mr. Bertoni’s lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.

The stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.

They did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni’s forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. “The FDA’s Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,” the attorney said in an email.

After considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.

An FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family’s holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.

“The FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,” said the spokesman.

When federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.

Valerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board’s Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.

Members of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers’ rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office dismissed the charge in January 2021.

Last November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB’s inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.

The report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney’s office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report—Ms. Hardy-Mahoney—received additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.

At the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei’s husband.

In June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank “in a very, very difficult position.” Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he “just would love to see” a clear policy on the matter.

Because Mr. Powell didn’t dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.

In early September 2018, Ms. Wei’s husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.

It then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.

Ms. Wei’s husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei’s disclosure.

The Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.

The new Fed rules for top people don’t apply to Ms. Wei because she isn’t senior enough. The trades were “permissible then and are permissible now,” said the Fed spokeswoman.

Ms. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had “no responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.” She said the Fed “did not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.”

Ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei’s trades didn’t violate conflicts rules.

Roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.

In one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC’s own rules.

The financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal’s review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020—an average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.

About one-third of those reported 2020 trades—2,994—involved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.

Over the years, to safeguard the CFTC’s integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees’ investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC’s role doesn’t include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.

Nonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail’s husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission “could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.” The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission’s statutory authority.

Mr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn’t speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn’t respond to requests for comment.

At the CFTC, “employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,” said the agency spokesman. “In this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse’s investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.”

Mr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: “The FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.”

The Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.

Across the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.

Reed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

At the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.

Defense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.

Nearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn’t include Alibaba. The company’s stock rose 4% that day.

Three days later, Mr. Werner’s financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.

The sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.

In an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn’t involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.

The Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn’t own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee’s duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.

At least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon’s top cybersecurity official.

Between 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

Mr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn’t direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn’t involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn’t see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.

Within federal agencies, ethics officials generally don’t consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials’ ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don’t know what employees are working on.

When ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies’ inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.

A Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.

One matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse’s financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren’t allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official’s work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.

When a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC’s inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.

The SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: “We take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.”

Are stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.

Most federal agencies don’t have protocols to verify that officials’ financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.

The official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.

At the EPA, Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.

The conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not “participate personally and substantially” in matters that have a “direct and predictable effect” on their investments and those of family members.

When the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn’t have any influence over environmental policy.

His “duties are administrative in nature,” his boss, the EPA’s chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. “He provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect” on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina’s financial disclosure.

In his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn’t file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.

Ethics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina “scores” of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In one email, a senior ethics official said his office had “provided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.”

Mr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn’t know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.

“We have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,” wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, “so I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.”

The next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. “I feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,” he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.

“If the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,” Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. “I believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.”

Ethics officials didn’t investigate Mr. Molina’s trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.

On the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina’s final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.

Mr. Molina wrote out a personal check to “U.S. Treasury” and sent it to officials in the EPA’s ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed.",1821,Buffet says invest in what you know.,"At this point, what even is there to do ?

in the current times of turmoil I sometimes look back at ten year charts and think to myself: Goddamn I'd be so fucking rich if I had started investing 10 years ago. Given the current state of the world, I'd not be sure we see those gains ever again.

Many companies out of those sectors that were around back then and are around today, multiplied it's value by at least 10x. Even broad investing into indexes would have made you 3 to 6 times richer.

Stock market,wallstreetbets,MY (f19) BF (22M) JERKED OFF TO THE STOCK MARKET??," 

I know the title sounds deranged, but I swear to god im not a troll. Here’s the context:

My bf and I are long distance, so we used to have plenty of phone sex, however, that’s been happening less and less often as our relationship has gone on (according to him, he just doesn’t feel as horny as often anymore). We’ve met and had relations irl a few times, and he’s always the kind to last very long in bed, and during phone sex as well. I used to be insecure about it, thinking that maybe it was something wrong with me, but hes genuinely a great bf who constantly assures me, and has never once said anything bad about our sex life.

It should be noted that he watches plenty of porn (as do I), and neither of us see that as an issue, so this isnt about him hiding porn from me or something. We were calling today, and I was playing a game on my phone (papa’s cupcakeria, you can’t make this shit up), and after about twenty minutes of us doing our own thing, he suddenly goes “im done” and shows me his cum????? Obviously, I get really confused and ask how the hell he was jerking off this whole time without me realising (we were on video call), before mentioning that I thought he was looking at the stock market (he spends his free time just staring at the stock market for hours on end like a lunatic, but I love him so it’s whatever).

Tell me why this man then looks me in the eyes and goes “yeah, I was looking at the stock market, I was too lazy to look for porn.”

It then hits me that he literally just CAME to the stock market. When I point this out to him, all he said in response was “it’s a man thing, I didn’t wanna bother you while you were playing your game” and told me not to worry about it.

Now, I don’t want to sound insane, but I got a bit upset, because in my head, he could have very easily asked to have phone sex with me, but chose to literally jerk off to the stock market instead. To add insult to injury, he came REALLY quickly (like significantly quicker than he would during anything involving me) which makes me feel like SHIT, because there is no way the goddamn stock market is somehow more stimulating than his own damn girlfriend.

Don’t get me wrong, i’m not super genuinely upset, but you’ve gotta admit this shits gonna hurt your pride if it happened to you. I honest to god have no idea how to even move forward after this, and I just needed to type this out, because no one would believe me otherwise 💀",5835,"

Trading strategy,wallstreetbets,GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,"I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.

Obviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.

**First, the comment as it was:**

*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.

Holding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.

If you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).

If you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*

Essentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. 

1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.

2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.

So what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* 

#Volume

Without volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.

This thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.

Now this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.

#Options

The other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.

1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.

2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.

You can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.

If, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:

1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.

2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.

Not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.

If you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.

Tl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.

Trading strategy,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with this trading strategy?,"I gotta be honest with you, I'm kinda mentally handicapped.   
But I don't understand how my strategy couldn't work. I've been using Bollinger bands  
since they do a great job of keeping the chart within the boundaries almost at all times.  
So isn't it a good idea to just always sell an asset short while it's at the top, say above 2SD,  
then secure gains at around the midline? Wait for it to go to an extreme value again, and take a long or short position accordingly once again?  
I identified two risks, first is the price moving in a slow trend with low volatility, when there might not be any opportunity to sell, or when the price makes a strong fast movement. The first risk can be mitigated by simply selling after some set time, and when the price remains roughly in the middle for a long time, and the second situation can be identified with moving averages. This strategy has a downside of not taking advantage of long and big price movements, but should be absolutely killing it in ambiguous market conditions when the price is moving horizontally, or at least that's what I figured. Most stable stocks should have a lot of those ""boring periods"", when the strategy works. Even if the market was changing periodically, it should still generate positive outcomes. With well planned stop losses, how could this not generate worthwhile returns? ",6,"

>TL;DR: I think Bollinger Bands could be used to generate consistent returns in sideways markets, but I may be wrong.",TA tells you what has happened.   It has zero predictive power.   Trends that you think are ending will continue beyond what you would expect and price action will reverse at the most unexpected times.   Bollinger bands are not the path to unlimited effortless money.,">It is impossible to predict the future movements of markets with 100% accuracy, so there will always be some risk involved in any strategy. However, your strategy sounds like it could work well in many situations and may produce good returns overall. One thing to keep in mind is that Bollinger bands are based on historical data, so they may not be as accurate in predicting future price movements. Also, moving averages can lag behind the current price, so you might miss out on some potential profits if the market starts moving up or down quickly. Overall though, this seems like a solid strategy that could work well in many cases."

Options trading,wallstreetbets,I am never trading options again,"This was the original title and post I wrote up before the events of Thursday transpired. Everything in quotes was written by past me: 

""I’ve disabled options trading. I will dump all my money into blue chips and index funds. I’ve just made 100k over a span of 3 days. 

[The contracts gained more value, but I didn't screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/m6328lnwazxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a795f81624d5e6cd1fe43471261a27692664af)

https://preview.redd.it/ku4wnnqxazxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=b802bab4bd2b9cf7c4cf18b79aea65a065133c31

The screen shots are incomplete because I was trying to sell quick. It’s about 100k profit when you factor in I lost 60k entering the trade on shorter dated puts. 

I’m going to be completely candid. Whether that gets me banned or not, I will take that risk. 

From the moment I uttered this comment, I set fourth the most regarded scheme in history. 

[When I decided to hold until recivership ](https://preview.redd.it/hgp4xiumdzxa1.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=9577ebc5463dacf10930ba6fc247f670d1757060)

At the time, FRC hadn’t halted trading. I reached out to Robinhood support to get their stance on what would happen during a halt. I didn’t show the full conversation, but they were extremely unclear. They said that I would be short if I exercised, but I’d have a hard time covering that short position. Although this is not saying yes or no, it’s definitely terrible communication on their part. 

A lawsuit based on the hypothetical scenario we discussed is a complete long shot. Out of curiosity, I asked a lawyer that day. They said I was likely to win if Robinhood backed out but they needed more details. I did not trust this scummy lawyer. I had another option. [Robinhood had previously cracked to social media pressure and allowed people to exercise puts into a short position.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/03/16/robinhood-bends-to-pressure-and-permits-short-selling-to-replace-put-options-on-signature-bank/?sh=6a7e783c2312) They have a history of bending to social media backlash. There’s even this disclaimer when stocks are halted: 

[This is directly from backlash on Reddit when they disabled the buy button. ](https://preview.redd.it/hmv5lc8jbzxa1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e03b956c1bb8cc242788f12d541215efbf27d44)

I thought I could increase the odds by creating viral posts about Robinhood’s misdeeds. Hopefully Robinhood would crack knowing their name was being smeared on the front page of Reddit. WSB backing me would have been helpful but not necessary. I just needed to make noise. 

I believed the chances I could cash out were high to begin with. I was sort’ve right. Multiple brokers allowed exercising into a short. Just not Robinhood. They still may have made an exception, as their support told me multiple times it “might” happen. But I wasn’t about to wait till expiration without a fight. 

Within the quest to fight Robinhood, I made this bet: 

[The fateful ban bet](https://preview.redd.it/a7vosyp6azxa1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7fae27f31c7a2a414df81c845c96d931e7c0e6b)

Robinhood did not allow short selling for FRC put holders as the terms of the bet demanded. I sold the contracts instead of exercising. \[Based on the terms of the bet I do not have to pay anything. I still planned on donating a few thousand until yesterday.\]

Whether this scheme would have worked, I guess we’ll never know. FRC began trading OTC and exercising was not necessary anymore. 

Despite being correct, I’ve taken up a reckless unsustainable trading approach. If I continue on this path, I will lose everything. I’ve seen it so many times where someone makes a very intelligent correct trade, then starts thinking they’re a trading genius. They start making reckless bets in things they have no business buying. This is an extremely slippery slope for me. I’ve blown up multiple accounts and I refuse to make the same mistake. I hope I can set an example- don’t keep rolling the dice. Take the money and run. 

I know it’s very obvious to everyone; cashing out is the smart thing to do. But in my position the rush of euphoria from a massive win like this is intoxicating. The sobering despair of previous losses melts away. It’s very hard to fight the imaginative ideas of becoming a multimillionaire and retiring under 30. I hope I can set an example and inspire others to break the gambling cycle. Hopefully, I will be able to maintain self control, but the urge to make one more bet is always there. I refuse let myself squander this life altering amount of money.""

**PRESENT MOMENT:**

I saw PACW tanking after hours based on news that they were looking for sellers. They had already said this in their ER that they were looking to sell assets. I felt the drop overblown fear from FRCs collapse. 

I bought when it was at $2.90 but because I didn’t put a limit order in RH averaged purchase price was fucking $3.40 my god. Immediate 40k loss.

[Paper handed while it was dumping after Robinhood's shitty payment for order flow bought the shares at an inflated price. ALWAYS SET LIMIT ORDERS](https://preview.redd.it/4oshkmswbzxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9875c83b56c10d33360ae3f29904aa82b15012e)

 Then I think to myself: PACW’s drop is not completely overblown. The need to shore up liquidity is bad in this environment and a recovery is higher risk. So I thought, let me buy a regional that is being pulled down just because everything is tanking: FHN. 

The TD CEO firmly stated they were committed to buying FHN. So any massive drop has huge upside. Surely TD wouldn’t back out of the deal 8 hours after I go all in. 

[I sold around 9.70, still lost a ton, but this loss wasn't fully realized](https://preview.redd.it/uu66q2n6czxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=a72df7c25b41d92c98a20335ab656d421f3c6cdb)

I am completely spiraling into whirlpool of gambling and degeneracy. I am trying to control myself. I lost another 50k yesterday and made it back just as quick. I'm playing with fire and I'm foolishly dead set on making back what I've lost. I've finally found an amazing risk reward trade to make all my money back plus profit. Selling WAL puts. I still stand by the idea that this current panic in regionals is far overblown. WAL especially is nothing like FRC and its odds of collapse are extraordinarily low. Currently selling $12 puts for a huge premium while that stock is at $20, this is a very safe bet to make back everything. I will roll into the $2.5 puts for an even safe bet. IV is at 500%, this is almost free money. WAL is not like FRC, even if PACW falls, WAL will be ok. 

[Everything is riding on WAL surviving. Very safe bet in my opinion.](https://preview.redd.it/5z83n0mzczxa1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36ee99b374712bc3617a4cb469e7f0a5f27595ab)

Then I can finally end this nightmare, quit the gambling and move on with my life. No more sleepless nights, no more insane schemes. I will finally come out on top and follow my original intentions after I made out on FRC. I am jumping into a wild ape cage posting this. I am revealing myself to be a reckless fool to the millions that believe I owe an Autism charity $10k. The internet is brutal, do with me what you will.",2478,"""I'm never trading options again""

""So I found this strat where I'm selling puts on WAL for a huge premium""",Robinhood gave you the money cause they knew they would get it back.,You are going to lose everything. Might as well give it to charity today

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,AMC - Quick technical and fundamental analysis for the next weeks,"What's up Apes,

Let's have a quick look at AMC and some possible scenarios for next week.

TLDR at the bottom.

The sell off has considerably slowed down in the last month, and the price has been mostly consolidating between 30 and 40 usd. Better than expected results for the third quarter, and some news announced in the earnings call on the 9th of august have led to a considerable price increase and gap up , which was quickly met with strong selling back down to support. From there, price has once again formed a double bottom and was mostly up in the following 4 or 5 trading days.

Overall, volatility and volume are down, which is good news for the bulls, because it indicates that the bears have lost some steam.

Let's have a look at the technicals.  


**Price Action**

Price is currently trading inside two wedge patterns, a small and a big one, indicated in the chart below with red and blue trend lines. If price breaks the upper red line, a rally and a test of the upper resistance of the big wedge (40usd) is likely. If it bounces off that resistance, I expect price to retest the lower red support again (30usd). A break and daily close above 40 would indicate forther upside (target 50 usd), while a break and daily close below would indicate further downside (target 25 usd)

**MACD**

The daily MACD has turned green for the first time since june. The moving averages are crossing. Overall the MACD suggest the momentum is shifting to the upside.

https://preview.redd.it/fo3h65p1fih71.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=e42dc446a8e257ed4d9374ce73caba5931f07238

**RSI**

There is a bullish divergence in the RSI (Matching RSI lows while second price low was lower than the first), as well as a double bottom. Overall, the RSI indicates a decreasing bearish momentum and suggests that a (at least temporary) bottom might be in.

https://preview.redd.it/t6qpc4qofih71.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a43da79a122bfc655267ab28bb2ce7a7593b9f

**TLDR - Points of interest**

Long Positions: I am looking for an entry around 30 USD if price falls down there again. I am also looking for a break of the upper red resistance for a rally to 40. If 40 breaks, I am looking at 50.

Short Positions: I am looking at a bounce either off the upper red resistance back to 30, or if that resistance breaks, a bounce off the upper blue resistance back to either the upper red trendline, or if that breaks, 30 usd. However, bears should be careful. Price is down quite a lot, never chase.

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,TSLA fundamentals analysis - why it's not overvalued,"ARK’s latest price target for Tesla has been the subject of a lot of discussion lately. They believe it will reach $3000 per share in the next 5 years, which based on its current market price of $654 implies about a 50% annual rate of return. If you haven’t already, you can take a look at the [article](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/) they published explaining how they arrived at this price target and the assumptions they made.

I recently got [downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8pntp/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/grq28wo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) for suggesting that this price target wasn’t illogical and that Cathie wasn’t crazy. So I wanted to explain my reasoning a bit more so that more people can downvote me and tell me why I’m wrong.

Now just to be clear, I’m not here to argue about whether EVs are the future, whether existing car companies are unprepared to switch to EV, or whether Tesla is an insurance play. I’m assuming that you’re already interested in investing in Tesla and the only thing stopping you is its valuation.

**P/E. It’s over 1000! But is it a useful metric?**

P/E seems to be the most common argument for why Tesla is overvalued. Why buy Tesla at 1023 P/E when you could buy GM at 14 P/E or even Workhorse at 23 P/E?

Let’s step back a bit. Companies can be categorized into one of three stages: growth, maturity, and decline. P/E is useful for valuing mature companies against their mature competitors, since all other things being equal we’d expect their P/Es to eventually equalize as well. For example, I recently bought Target partly because of its P/E of 22 vs Walmart’s 28 and Costco’s 34 (although one could argue that some/all of these companies are still in their growth stage).

On the other hand, P/E is less useful when looking at companies in the growth and decline phases. You could find companies with P/E below 1, but they may be value traps rather than automatic buys. If they go out of business next year, their stock will be worthless.

P/E is similarly flawed when looking at growth stocks. P/E doesn’t account for whether a company is spending a lot aggressively re-investing in itself, or if a company has small earnings now but a good chance of quickly growing into a much larger market. If you had the chance to buy a loss-making company now at $1B market cap now, knowing that its addressable market will quickly expand to $100B, you’d still make a profit over the long term, even buying at massively “inflated” P/E.

That said, P/E is still useful for measuring risk in a growth stock or upside in a declining stock. If Tesla were to transition from growth to maturity or decline, there’s no doubt its P/E and share price would decline significantly. But risk is part of growth investing; this risk exists with other growth stocks too.

**Forward P/E**

While Tesla’s trailing P/E is 1023, its forward P/E is a high but less eye-popping 119. Trailing P/E is calculated by dividing the stock’s market value by its share price, while forward P/E is calculated by dividing the company’s estimated earnings in the following year by its share price. Forward P/E is a more error-prone and risky metric since nobody knows what a company will earn in the future. But it can still be useful when considering the price of a stock, since the market tends to price in expected future performance.

Comparing to some other popular growth stocks, Tesla’s forward P/E is still high but not unreasonable. PINS has 58, SHOP has 227, NFLX has 40. And at least it’s positive. Many growth stocks such as NIO, NKLA, lucid, PLTR, and LMND don’t expect to be profitable within the next year.

And while Tesla’s P/E is high it’s difficult to make a direct comparison with these mentioned companies since they’re not profitable companies in the EV space. There really isn’t another profitable EV company to compare forward P/E with, and that uniqueness/first mover advantage could be partly why Tesla trades at a high forward P/E.

That said, Tesla is still overpriced if (unfairly) comparing against mature auto-makers; GM is at 10 forward P/E, F is at 8. But if you believe those companies have a chance to become EV growth companies and won’t be weighed down by their mature/declining combustion businesses, I’d argue that’s more of a reason to buy them than to sell Tesla.

**Price-to-sales**

If a company is re-investing in itself aggressively, it may be incurring costs that aren’t part of its core business. Once growth slows, it may be able to cut these expenses and dramatically improve its P/E. To account for this, we can look at price to sales.

TSLA’s price-to-sales is 20. For comparison, SHOP is at 47, PLTR is at 40, FVRR is at 42, NIO is at 27, NKLA is chilling at 63619, lucid is at infinity since it doesn’t have sales yet. It’s quite an oversimplification to make these comparisons without considering what portion of a company’s expenses is related to operating costs. SHOP has better margins than TSLA for example, since it’s in a totally different business. But nevertheless, one could argue TSLA is currently undervalued by this metric, even compared to other EV companies.

**A historical example**

Another common argument is that the whole market is overvalued right now, and this is especially the case for growth stocks. I don’t pretend to know what the market will do in the short term, and I’m certainly not discounting the possibility of a further rotation out of growth in the near future. But I know that eventually the market will rotate back into growth stocks. You may have looked like a fool buying Amazon or Microsoft at the height of the dot com bubble, but if you held until now, you’d get the last laugh.

So let’s look at an example from a time when there was less talk about stocks being overvalued. Facebook IPO’d in 2012 at a P/E of 91.2 and price to sales of 24 ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2012/05/17/facebook-is-flat-out-expensive-compared-to-google-at-ipo/?sh=5c83b70c6d03)). Both FB at the time and TSLA now have an annual growth rate of about 45%.

If we take Tesla’s forward P/E, this comparison actually makes Tesla’s price look reasonable, even though Tesla currently trades in a market with record high average P/E.

**Market cap**

One last note - market cap. Yes, Tesla’s market cap is quite high as it’s already one of the most valuable companies in the world. At $654B, if Tesla actually reached $3000 per share it would be the most valuable company in the world (unless other top companies continue to grow as well, which is likely).
The global market for EVs is expected to grow to $800B by 2027, from $162B in 2019. If this is accurate, and you believe Tesla retains its market share and current valuation, without expanding into other areas like ride hailing and insurance, then  the EV market ~5Xing could justify Tesla’s share price ~4.5Xing.

**Tl;dr**

While Tesla is certainly overvalued by trailing P/E, this is a somewhat flawed metric, and by looking at other metrics like forward P/E, price-to-sales, and growth rate, an argument can be made that Tesla is more-or-less fairly valued, and potentially even undervalued. This argument holds even if looking at historical examples from less frothy markets, such as FB after its IPO in 2012.

Like any growth stock, Tesla is a high-risk investment, since its future share price depends on future growth of both the company and the EV space. But the potential for reward is also higher.

I’m not a financial advisor and this isn’t financial advice.

The wedge looks like it has broken down, but it could easily be just an extension of a wedge. The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze.

But this is not the point of the post today. Today I am here to convince you why a cost basis of 20 or 25 doesn't matter for PLTR. You are buying the company at around 40-50x 2020E sales, Which seems quite high  (not as much compared to SNOW and some other big data plays) but still. So why bother with PLTR?

This was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017

[https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)

I started by looking at the S&P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today’s technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.

There is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.

I agree with Peter Thiel’s thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the “world of stuff”. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched  out like a tree and built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed  into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.

So I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.

**Information Technology Cycles**

The following is my attempt at describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.

Electronic Age

**Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace physical labor.(Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)

**Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.(Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)

**Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.(Important companies: AT&T, NBC, IBM)

Computing/Software Age

**Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace  basic mental labor.(Important companies: IBM)

**From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.(Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)

**Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.(Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)

Cloud/AI Age

**Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.(Candidate Important companies\*\*:\*\* AWS, Microsoft, Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)

**Specialized AI (2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.(Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)

**General AI (2075-2100):** Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.

The average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.

The initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:

In the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.

The proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).

The consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.

What it means today,

I would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.

**From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.

It is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.

2020 Update:

If we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever and they could start selling other equipment and devices all of which were collecting licensing or patent fees.

I have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.

Sorry if this DD sucks ass and leads a bunch of people to ditch $AMC. Just focus on the future, and think about the mind of the consumer. Most of that shit they teach in business school is bullshit is trash. Trust me. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

​
I will return to that a bit later in this DD. Here's another take based on fundamentals on why you might consider $AMC at \~$13/share one of the great value investment opportunities of our time. ~~Bear~~ with me as I, too, am just a retard like some of the readers here.
​
Let's begin with the basic asymmetries in a macroeconomic context:
​
* Market Cap (MC):  427.869 M
* Enterprise Value (EV): 11.349 B
​

When seeing that figure, you might wonder if you don't know shit, why might a company have an enterprise value so much greater than its Market Cap. A Company's EV is the total debt + market cap - cash on hand. As you may have heard in the recent news, nobody is having trouble getting access to cash. So then, why might that figure be significant at all if it is practically just about how much the company owes + aggregate value of the stonk. Well, my father used to say, the price of a product is what someone is willing to pay for it. If someone wanted to buy or takeover AMC, they need to pay around 11.349 B. In a few months, I anticipate that number to be so much higher.
​

The main reason I think $AMC dropped so low and generated so much short seller risk to begin with is the fact that there was a bankruptcy risk. That risk has been wholly eliminated, though I never saw it.
​

As we find ourselves in a cash flush world where at least 18 Trillion in debt is negative yielding ([mostly bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/world-s-negative-yield-debt-pile-at-18-trillion-for-first-time)), we should expect a company with so many assets and a previously healthy balance sheet like AMC to be have access to some of it. The rising stonk price even incentivized Silverlake to convert their debt to shares and sell them (silly bankers).
​

At the same time, the all-star CEO boomer Adam Aron himself grabbed an additional $304.8 M in cash through a direct listing initiated on Monday. I don't know why he couldn't wait until Wednesday to initiate because [it would've been over $1B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-stock-sale/amc-seizes-on-rally-to-sell-stock-but-misses-even-bigger-payday-idUSKBN29W2UP). I trust his judgement. Boomers are more experienced and have ~~steady~~ hands. At the same time, Aron beat back the well known short selling smuts known as Apollo Global Management as they attempted to force bankruptcy on AMC.
​

The confluence of these factors (EV, Access to Liquidity, Stellar Executive Team) and the four I outline below, lead me to believe that even Stevie Wonder can see that this stock is obviously worth at least $30/share.  
​
​

**The undisputed market leader in theaters.**
​

* 1,0004 Theatres worldwide
   * Many auditoriums at AMC locations, often holding over more than one auditorium, seat over 400 people. 
      * They posted 5.47 million in revenues. Auditoriums were rarely at capacity.
   * 8,043 screens/auditoriums.
   * They will all be packed when opened back up.
      * Tons of really great movies were held anticipating the end of the lockdown and the re-opening of the movies. Keep this in mind. This is critical to the fundamental analysis and related to the subsequent points.
   * Margins are *ok* but especially good on the snacks. In the past, consumers have tended to say fuck AMC's margins and bring in their own goodies either because AMC's were ass or because they wanted to save a few dollars. We expect this pattern to slow down substantially because of what they mean for the people.  I recognize that this one is a reach, but it's my opinion not investment advice.
​

**The shifting sentiment from ""Netflix and Chill"" to in-person, shared and enjoyable experience.**
​

* I don't like people, but I miss them. Maybe you do too. In a mid-pandemic Gallup Poll, we all know how much those matter, [71% of consumers want to go to the fucking theaters](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/). If I just put my finger in the air and give 35% of Netflix's market cap to AMC... you see where I'm going with this.
* I have seen others say this one as well, but I miss when everyone went to the movies and watch the same thing, on the same screen, at the same time because we can share. 
* Netflix and the streamers need to watch out because come July, the boomer is coming with that heat. Everyone is anticipating trips to movies. I tried to make the popcorn. I used a half a stick of butter. It's not the same.
   * Running to 7-Eleven to get Slurpees and Raisinets while Netflix is buffering is super annoying. Last time, my 7-Eleven didn't even have Raisinets. \[Samuel L. Jackson voice\] ""Where's my mothafuckin Raisinets Jack?""
* As you think through this point, remember the last time you saw Samuel L. Jackson in the theaters. you weren't the only that was scared, so it was entertaining and not stressful.
* This point isn't totally out of my ass either. As streaming popularity has grown, so has AMC's  revenues, not including 2020. People watch more movies.
​

**Relationship with distributors and studios is still a strong moat.**   

Everyone here should check out a movie. They don't have the awesome search and browse capabilities afforded by Netflix or the sweeping device compatibility. You can stream from your laptop and connect to your.  
​
​
* Studios have ben delaying their films repeatedly to wait for AMC to open back up. To me, that sounds like immense power and a very strong relationship. I commend the studios for that and I think you have to be a hedge fund jackass not value that moat accordingly. Even Morningstar sees that and they usually don't see shit!
* The Netflix app is cool but we can all agree, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 80% of the content is ass. Movies are a crap shoot. Shows are a political statement. And there's not enough Chapelle.
   * What Chapelle represents amongst so many other things is someone who has walked away from the traditional film industry. While I am all for the new person on the block, I feel movies are very hard to make. Sometimes the Netflix ones suck hard. I don't recall too many times when I went to a movie theater and had to leave because the movie sucked that bad. I've been disappointed, underwhelmed, but have never chucked my remote at the screen. I cannot say the same about Netflix. I have seen some terrible shit on Netflix, multiple times. I go there every day still because their app is so good, but Hollywood is still better at making films than Los Gatos or wherever the fuck. \*
* You can rent some of the movies that would be in theaters now. I'm sure the quality of the acting and dialogue will be superior to the shit we often get on Netflix.
   * I haven't done it yet, but I promise to do it for the first time tonight as I discovered the [On Demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/news-of-the-world-61825) product line in doing some research for this DD. I assure you that the products will be overpriced, and the digital experience will be ass, but they just got $300 M to go figure that shit out. 
   * Boomer CEO: Lower your price point and move your on-prem servers to EC2 instances. You got this! Re-invest hard for a while as you build up the integrations to be a first-class citizen in Roku, etc.

**Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice.**

In doing more research, I learned that both AMC and AMCX were seeing incredible short interest. Every resource I used reported both higher than they should be, but the inconsistency in the numbers from trusted and premium services has led me to withhold my numbers.  The ranges for AMC were between 24% of total float and 68% of total float. When I tried to calculate myself based on short interest theory and the average volume of the stock as of  a month ago, I landed at 62. Since I am retarded, the answer is probably in the 40-50. 

​
*Current short volume:* 44,670,000 shares


*True Float:*  71,000,000 shares

​
*Dollar Volume Sold Short:* $385.50 million 

​
On the last one yes, you read that right. This idiots have sold more short volume in price than the market cap of the stock. How could they do this shit all over again. They don't give a fuck. They think they will get away with it. 
​


Regardless, some idiots sold another 8,000,000 shares short ON FRIDAY. Well, I have 2500 shares across four platforms. I am buying more on Monday, but my buddy had an interesting idea because the stock is so low. Options may actually be an even better play for me because I can buy hundreds of them (thanks to this subreddit). If I exercise as many options as I can hold the stock with diamond hands, it could accelerate the gamma squeeze that will happen if those short selling assholes don't back down.  And we know they won't . 

​
In closing, as with $GME, I have fond memories of my times at AMC as a child and teenager. It was the first place my friend drove me after he got his license. 
​
Also as with $GME, I like the stock.

​
*Positions*

​
shares: 2479, avg cost basis of 6.54,  I have been building up for a while

​
options: a lot (strike prices ranging from $2.5 to $9 because these jackasses thought they knew wtf was going on but are out of touch with the commoner. On Monday, I will buy more. 98% of my options are already in cheese.
​
​
On WeBull, I learned that you can buy stonks starting at 4 AM / 7 AM or something like that so I am moving some money in there.
​

Edit: I will set a limit order of 100 to expire in 90 days, the brokerage cannot sell my shares. If I still don’t want to sell at that price and it gets close, just add another $100. I will never sell, but always have a limit order if these short sellers want to try and screw you out of deep fucking value.

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,I track YOLOs so you don't have to - August 2019 (+ new fundamental analysis added to the site),"For those of you that aren't familiar with the site I created, it's at:

[SwaggyStonks](https://www.swaggystocks.com)

It contains a WSB 'Sentiment' analyzer, Due Diligence tracker, and a YOLO tracker.

# Quick ""How it works""

I log positions of posts flagged as ""YOLO/Gains/Losses"" and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it's appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments/juicy details as well! All other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the ""Expired YOLOs"" section.

New Section! I've added a new section of ""Top YOLOs"". Here you can go through the TOP YOLOs of All Time (TYOAT) and view the YOLOs by: most upvotes, biggest gains, biggest losses.

Please note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It's fun to see what they could be worth!

&#x200B;

**Recent additions to the site:**

\* As per last month's post. I've finally pushed the updates that include viewing some nice stock financial charts and fundamental analysis. Here's a short breakdown of the new features I've added. If you want a full summary on them, I made a post in r/StockMarket that has a lot more info! The post can be found here

[Fundamental Analysis Post - Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/cvtrpc/i_created_a_stock_market_site_that_visually/)

&#x200B;

**New Features**

**1)** A new ""Stocks"" section where you can search stocks outside of the WallStreetBets sentiment. In this section you can search for tickers to do your own fundamental analysis. The stock page contains the following data:

**1-A)** Short-term stock chart, fundamental data, key stats, and recent news.

**1-B)** Stock Financials: For you fake autists you can finally view your favorite stock financials data in nicely organized charts (w/ pretty colors). Here you can quickly scan fundamental financial data to get a quick understanding of how your stock is operating. Personally, I find the charts on the ""Fundamental Data"" section the most helpful, but if you want to dive into all the financial statements that's cool too. For you REAL autists who love crunching numbers switch between ""Chart-Mode"" and ""Textify"" to read those beautiful numbers.

**1-C)** Historical Earnings: Wanting to do an EARNINGS YOLO? View how your stock has reacted in the past to previous earnings report and take a gamble where the next one will go. A good example of this is AAPL who's stock price has declined on earnings only 1 time! (literal WOW).

**2)** Earnings Calendar: MY earnings calendar isn't as pretty as ""Earnings Whisperer's"" calendar, but I feel it provides a bit more data to see who is reporting that day. Scroll below the calendar and you'll be able to see all recent earnings reports and stock price reactions to those reports. The calendar only displays stocks greater than 45-50B in MARKET CAP, but there is a button at the top to display ALL upcoming earnings in list-view.

&#x200B;

**Future Updates** (Here's what I am currently working on for the site and should be ready in the next week or two):

I am currently working on adding an ""Options Analyzer"" tool. The tool will work by scanning day-old options data (maybe 3-4 days old for smaller cap stocks less than 5B) and log it to my database. It will be similar to Barchart's ""Option"" analyzer tool (mine is also FREE), but I wanted to focus on less of an options screener/filter and more on improving how you can compare the prices on purchasing/selling an option. For example, the tool can be used mainly in the following ways:

&#x200B;

**1)** View the historical yield for an option of a specific expiration date throughout the entire life of the option. (IE: You view the call option chains for AAPL on September 6, 2019. You will be able to view an estimation of what the options were yielding (say, at 5% OTM) from inception to current date and see how the option price changed with reporting earnings or other market fluctuations/news.

**2)** Filter through a list options of highest premiums and lowest premiums. Use this tool to see where you might want to sell a covered call or a spread and collect premium vs outright buying the option instead. This tool will be great as a guideline rather than an indicator (IE: you see JNUG is at the top of the list providing 10% premium on 2-week options doesn't necessarily mean it's the best option to collect premium on. However, if you've been following AAPL and you see it's reached a high of $220 you can then see how much premium you might be able to collect by selling a call spread or covered call.)

**3)** Option Yields Comparisons: Say you've been following 3 stocks: DIS, AAPL, AMZN. You think all 3 stocks have been hit very hard in the short term due to some Trump tweets, so you think it could be a great time to collect some premium by selling PUTS on the stock. The Yields-Comparison tool will be able to show you what each of the 3 stocks are currently offering in terms of yields and help you with your decision.

\*The options tool will also tell you specifically which options include an upcoming earnings, which would become more of a gamble at that point, so you can avoid accidentally purchasing options that are more expensive due to earnings.

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,GME: My easy to understand and short fundamentals analysis March 24,"Not a financial advice

I did company valuations before and have gotten pretty accurate estimates. While I’m doing this valuation on GME, I can tell that I like the fundamentals of GameStop. Just think about it:
1) stating the obvious but would any of these senior leadership with massive backgrounds go work in a sinking ship? Of course not. GameStop for the long run
2) the gaming industry is growing on a compound annual growth rate of 11% and no one is positioned to take over that market like GameStop now with all their existing members and experience in the industry
3) e-commerce sales of GameStop accounts for 32% of all sales in just a year. This is insanely good. Reducing the brick and mortar side of business and increasing the online one is how it’s gonna be going forward. And this is all done under the supervision of e-commerce geniuses who built startups from scratch
4) when GameStop closes many of their stores that cost a lot of money per year, they’ll cut down on staffing, rents, and utilities which in turn will reduce their overall costs and increase their margins. They can even reduce margin on consoles and other accessories to the extent where it’s perfect competition with Amazon and ignite that huge used products market. 

It’s late here and I have to sleep but there’s a lot more that makes me believe this company is worth much more than chewy, zalando, and other e-commerce platforms.

Not a financial advice but here’s how I’m thinking about it",1032,Jenna Owens didn't leave Amazon to not get 2.5m in bonus money in a sinking ship. Not taking questions was probably a big f u to the analysts that pissed them off last time.,"BUT THEY MISSED EARNINGS!!! 😂 by 1 cent I’d say they did pretty damn good over all. 

And I agree. All that talent on a sinking ship??","They should reduce their overall store locations, but opt to put together  warehouse like locations for supply chain purposes. Maybe make it a warehouse that not only gets its products out immediately (they seem to strive for same-day shipping) but also allows people to come in and get what they need if they were to want to do that. Cost of having your own locations instead of paying to use others would have to be better one would think."
Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,TSLA Tesla Evaluation - Fundamental Analysis,"Hello Investors and Gamblers! We all know what Tesla is, but do we really know what it is worth? Are you bagholding and want to know if you shall cut losses or hold it to the core of the Earth? Or are you looking for a good entry price for a heavy Call or Put slapping?

Well you came to the righ post! Here i am evaluating TSLA Fair Value for you! Hope you enjoy the reading! And don't forget to share with the community your thought and prayers! Cheers!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Purpose**

The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the development of Tesla during the past three years, from 2019 to 2022. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration. In addition, a comparison to its main competitors and the market situation is also made. All is made to determine the fair value of the stock price and determine the investment strategy. All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company fairly valued by the market by its fundamentals?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

**Delimitations and Assumptions**

This thesis is delimited to an analysis of TSLA between the years 2019 and 2022. The thesis is based on the assumption that TSLA is the one of the most trending automotive company in the world, and that the prestige it has will support its price action in the next months.

**Methodology**

In this thesis, data from its financial statements are taken from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance and other publicly available information on the company on-line. The Company valuation is made based on:

* Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula
* Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model
* Discounted Cash Flow Model

**Hypothesis**

* US next interest rates hike of 25-50bps
* Inflation of 6.5% and cooling down to 6% for January 2023
* TSLA is high volume stock
* TSLA is overvalued
* There are many TSLA bagholders
* TSLA can’t outproduce its competitors in the near nor mid term

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Methodology

The thesis used macroeconomics data from the 13th of January 2023 for its valuations, Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Cash Flow are considered and projected to the next three years. The final price tag is obtained by the average of three valuation methodology: Graham Formula, Discounted Cash Flow and Cash Flow Evaluation. It is then given a 20% margin of error in both direction.

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, three methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

&#x200B;

# Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 24.40%** is determined by the average analysts consensus for the company’s next year growth rate.

&#x200B;

# Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company last year’s available cash flow data, its WACC based discount rate of 12,84% and its Growth Rate of 24,40% to determine a fair value of **$78.88** per share.

&#x200B;

# Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing. This thesis uses the adjusted formula to better adjust it to the current market environment.

Data used for the calculation:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|EPS|3.24|
|Growth Rate|24.40|
|AAA Bond Yield|4.40|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$101.74**

&#x200B;

# Discounted Cash Flow Model

This thesis uses Free Cash Flow, gained by subtraction Capex from Cash floe From Operations. Free cash flow (FCF) is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|WACC based discount rate|12.84%|
|Growth rate|24.40%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|Average Shares outstanding|3,157,752,000|

Which projected a FCF for the next five years as per follow:

Note: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is highly improbable due to unknown future events and variations in the market. This shall be taken only as an indicative forecast.

The calculation gives us a Fair Value of **$70.99** per share

&#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$78,88|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$101.74|
|Discounted Free Cash Flow Model|$70.99|
|**Final Price + 20% error margin**|**$104.83**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$83.87**|
|**Final Price - 20% error margin**|**$62.90**|

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Insider Transactions

There are heavy and frequent sell activity from insiders of the company from all departments, biggest drop of shares come from the CEO itself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SWOT ANALYSIS

Strengths

* **Most Valuable Automotive Company**: It is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation.
* **Tesla Increased its Electric Vehicle Delivery**: In 2022 it increased its deliveries of 40% from 935 thousands  to 1.3 million units.
* **Cross-sell and Diversification**: Tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with Liberty Mutual insurance company.
* **Innovative Company**: Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.

## Weaknesses

* **Manufacturing Complications**: Tesla faces continuous launch, manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products. For example, Tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch Model X, which lead to constant delays for distribution. Similarly, the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing Model X’s battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1.
* **Unable to meet demand might affect brand value**: Due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures, Tesla’ might face an unbalanced supply and demand, unable to meet the production ramp.
* **Lack of High Volume Productio**n: It has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models. Even now, as the company plans to manufacture Model 3 vehicles at high volume, it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources.
* **Shortage of Batterie**s: The shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
* **Elon Musk as Tesla’s Sole Representative**: Musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests.
* **Financial Uncertainty**: Tesla has outstanding debt of $5.38 Billion. If the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt, then there is a risk of delaying expansion, reducing investments, selling assets, etc.
* **Employee Safety Concerns**: Tesla was recently fined in 2019 for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection. Also, the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching California’s heat.
* **Leadership Wrangles**: Friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and long-term success. Tesla’s management and board have been engaged in several power struggles.
* **Tesla Faces Lawsuit over Sexual Misconduct**: Many Tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace. The women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct. They also alleged that they were cat-called and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks, groping, and misogynistic behaviour.

## Opportunities

* **Sales expansion in untapped Market**: The most significant opportunity for the company right now is the Asian market, even tho there are increased risks.
* **Less Expensive Car**: Tesla’s Model 3 is a more affordable version of Model S with less range, power, and fewer features.
* **Bringing battery production technology in-house**: Tesla intends to make its own battery cells.
* **Market Confidence in Tesla**: The stock market has shown confidence in Tesla after beating the projected car deliveries.

## Threats

* **Product Liability Claims**: The company has faced lawsuits and claims related to the failure of technology in their products. If these liability claims continued, then Tesla may be subjected to greater financial setbacks.
* **Extensive Competition**: Tesla, Inc. faces aggressive competition from both alternative fuel vehicles (Hybrid, Plug-in hybrid, fully electric car) and self-driving technology. Many automotive brands in the luxury segment like Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and in the economy segment like Toyota, Ford, General Motors , Volvo are getting ready for a fierce competition. Many brands are not only launching or planning to launch their environment-friendly-Self-driving technology but also, they are offering them at a comparably lower price.
* **Product Defects**: Tesla’s cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases. The defective products often have weaknesses in design, manufacturing, and other features which harm the company’s image permanently.
* **Long term confidence**: Tesla, due to its unstable manufacturing conditions, suffers from disbelief among the public about its long-term existence, which can result in a deficiency in further business development.
* **Customer Adaptation**: The company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles.
* **Disruption of Supply Due to Shortage of Materials**: Tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices. The company uses aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper, and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. All these materials have volatile prices, which can affect the company’s production line severely in the future.
* **High-Risk Factor Due to Usage of Lithium-ion**: Tesla uses lithium-ion cells in their battery packs. Lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element, which increases the risk factor of our products. Tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke, which has defamed the company on a major level.
* **Elon Musk’s Behavior Affecting Tesla’s Reputation**: Tesla’s entire reputation is built upon the cult of Elon Musk. But recently, his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting Tesla.
* **Competitors increasing productions of EV Vehicles**: Competitors are jumping in the EV segment eating huge portions of the market share.

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,Why are BioNTech & Moderna up 5% every day on no news? (Fundamental analysis),"BioNTech was $208 on July 13 and is $350 today, 15 trading days later. Its RSI is approaching 90. Moderna went from $235 to $365.

I understand they delivered wonders for humanity with effective COVID vaccines, but the magnitude of the surge is highly unusual. 

1) Delta - The variant is not exactly news at this point. The world has already gone through 3 major waves. This wave isn’t expected to be as bad as last winter’s, when BioN stock actually fell from $130 to $85 between early Dec 2020 & early Jan 2021.

2) Earnings - Since Pfizer reported earnings last week, BioN has run up another 25% since then. (They split vaccine revenues 50-50.) A large earnings beat should be more than priced in already.

3) Total Addressable Market

3a) Government deals - BioN & Moderna raised their vaccine prices in the latest EU contract. But this has been known for some time. The US government might push back against similar price increases.

3b) Booster shots - CDC has said booster shots are likely NOT needed for fully-vaccinated, otherwise healthy adults. Without recurring revenue, they would appear to be priced too richly (Moderna >20 forward P/E) for a largely one-time, even if multi-year, windfall.

There will also be political pushback against hoarding boosters for wealthy countries if most of the developing world hasn’t yet received their initial doses.

3c) Future products - No doubt both companies gained brand value from their covid vaccine, but future products are still years down the road.

4) Short interest - neither stock has unusually high short interest (<1% BioN, <4% Moderna) so it doesn’t appear to be a squeeze.

I don’t doubt both stocks can be worth $1,000+ by the end of this decade if they deliver other successful drugs. But a near-doubling in a month is crazy ... does anyone have some insights?",59,"

Technical analysis,wallstreetbets,Why Technical Analysis Is (Mostly) BULLSHIT,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Before you all comment ""sir this is a wendys"" -  I get that this is WallStreetBets, and you guys hate long posts and anything useful, but back in my day before this place had 12 million members - **people would actually post useful longform stuff and not just memes and loss porn.** Shit, I remember for a time we had a lawyer who started a book club and posted extremely longform in depth posts about all kinds of crazy stuff. So, if anyone is still around from that era, or if you are actually interested in learning something that can help you make even slightly more informed decisions, stay tuned.

This is an interesting sentiment/topic that many tards on WSB echo, but very few understand what they are saying or why they are saying it.

They simply echo this because they tried to all in their port one time on a stock that was RSI 20 and lost all their money. Or maybe they saw some other retard on the front page talking about how the MACD Crossover meant this stock **could not possibly go down again.**

The point is - most people write off trading indicators and pretty much all forms of technical analysis without really understanding what it is, or what it is used for.

I'm going to take a moment to elaborate on **why 99% of the technical analysis you guys see on the internet is complete bullshit -** and I'll even talk a little bit about how you can use some of it in a non-retarded way.

[Better TA Than Most Of The Shit Posted](https://preview.redd.it/q20i72v0c1391.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=58db4b87fdfe306fdcb7f902c31220665d0b8b87)

This actually might take longer than a moment, I am a retard after all and not great at counting (past 10), so grab some chicken tendies and sit tight.

# The Basics

To understand why most TA is bullshit, first you need to understand **what it even is.** Surprisingly, most people don't.

Put simply, TA is just about any form of analysis that uses **price and volume.** These are the two building blocks of TA. At face value, all a technical analyst has at his disposal is **price and volume.**

# The Problems & How Most ""Traders"" Use TA

[The Usual WSB TA Post](https://preview.redd.it/m13sgru4c1391.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c2d0e3ab4ee404a914c70f03ae10164f27251b)

Continuing on my last point. **RSI, MACD and all the other ""indicators"" you see are literally just ways of automatically organizing price and volume that our monkey brains couldn't possibly do in real time.**

They are not supercomputer machine learning algorithms that can save you from blowing up your portfolio. Depending who you ask, they can be beneficial for trading, but most people take it all completely out of context.

They take something like RSI and think: okay, when it's low, I buy - cannot go tits up.

Now you might be thinking ""what's the issue, when I look at a chart with RSI overlayed, it looks pretty darn useful""

**That's precisely the problem!**

If you glance at a chart and compare it to lot's of indicators - **they often appear useful.** However, this is where human psychology and our tendency towards bias comes into play. While at a glance it seems simple enough to just buy when MACD Crosses over - when you actually try this strategy out - you might explode your portfolio.

Why is this?

**1)** An indication to enter a trade is simply **one single part** of a complete trading system.

* It does you absolutely no good without knowing when to take profits, what option do you buy if you are trading options, how much stock or options do you buy, when do you stop loss if the trade is going wrong. The point is - there are so many other things that comprise a profitable trading system aside from **""WHEN TO ENTER"" - that's the easiest part! At face value, you have a 50% chance of being right regardless of what you are using to determine that!**

**2)** The technical method you are using to indicate when to enter a trade actually has no statistical significance.

* Remember how I said we have a tendency towards bias? When you are looking to go long on a stock, **your brain is already in confirmation bias mode.** You already decided to go long, you are just looking for the courage to pull the trigger. In this state, if you take a look at a chart, and on that chart buying at RSI 20 works 50% of the time - you will likely convince yourself into thinking it works most of the time! **Most technical analysis you see on the internet is cherry picking for confirmation bias.**
* A final point on statistical significance - 10, 20 or even 100 data points **does not prove statistical significance.** Market conditions constantly change, and with them so does what form of trading works and what form of analysis. In trading, you can't safely assume statistical significance without backtesting something across thousands of data points going back many years, and then forward testing it in today's market! For the record, most indicators by themselves do not have any predictive value. Like I said before, they are just organizing price and volume in a different way. In other words, they are telling you what you already know, but making it more glamorous.

**3)** The last (surprisingly common) issue with how most people do TA is that they **do not even take the time to learn how to do the bare minimum properly.**

* What I mean is, 99% of people on the internet can't even draw a trendline right. If you are this far gone - you will have much better luck using your pet Gecko's dietary habits to determine when to buy and sell (most of you probably weren't around for that age of WSB!).

# The Solutions & What TA Is Really Used For

Now that we have laid out why 99% of TA on the internet sucks ass - let's hear the other side of the story - and how you can use it in a non-completely-retarded way. The reality is, there are not many methods other than TA for trading **short-term.** Income statements and discount cash flow models will do you no good trading options weeklies.

When doing short-term trading - TA can actually be quite useful - so long as you understand the limitations it has.

So, what are some basic things you can employ to take **some usefulness** from TA instead of blowing your portfolio up because of it?

**1)** Stop listening to other people's analysis. Do your own fucking research.

* If you are going to do it, and going to fuck it up, at least have the decency to fuck up on your own, instead of following DickBusterXxX9012's Inverse Head and Shoulders setup he posted on WSB after watching a 5 minute YouTube video on what an ""Inverse Head and Shoulders"" is. It's funny how we will do anything we can to avoid actually fucking learning how to do something these days. Pick up a fucking book or something.

**2)** Understand TA (and indicators) are not and will never be an end all be all.

* **The truth is, TA is not a definitive methodology for being a profitable trader**. It's simply a way of plotting a roadmap to make better risk/reward trades than you would be able to otherwise. Sometimes, very rarely, the risk/reward you get from this roadmap, **in combination with all the other parts of a system I outlined in the last section**, results in you making a profit.
* Whether this profit is better than just throwing your money in SPY, or a profit at all, determines on your ""**edge"" -** or what you have to bring to the table that all the other retard's aren't already doing. In other words, what you can do differently that sets you apart. This is something that comes from thousands of hours staring at charts and studying or researching. No one can give it to you. The billion dollar Renaissance algorithms already arbitraged all the easy shit out.

**3)** Never make a trade based on a single data point in technical analysis.

* Remember I said most indicators alone have no predictive value. While this is true, multiple things lining up **can be useful.** Confluence is the lifeblood of technical analysis. If you decide to take things further and do some studying or research on the topic, make sure you are looking at multiple factors and how they coincide with each other. Looking at just a single indicator like RSI will never give you an edge.

**4)** Learn how to separate bias from truth.

* What truly separates a good technical analyst from a bad one is their ability to discern what is their emotions trying to confirm what they would like to happen, from what is actually a fact. The former is what most people do, and will do you no good. The latter can offer some assistance in picking short-term trades with favorable risk/reward. You could literally plot a chart in any number of ways that fits what you would like to happen, but there is only one way to plot what is most likely to happen.

# Conclusion & TL;DR

There is no secret magical indicator that is going to make you rich. It doesn't exist. Indicators themselves are not some revelation, they are just shit we already know stated differently.

Most TA on the internet is completely incorrect and retarded, but that doesn't mean TA as a whole is completely retarded. Without it - there really isn't many other ways to make short-term trades. If you want to use it, take it with a grain of salt, and do it on your own. Following behind other people's shitty analysis will do you no good.

However, TA isn't as easy as watching a YouTube video. There is no shortcut to being a good trader. It requires many hours of studying and practice.

If you aren't willing to do that - then just stop using it at all - and enter your trades based on whether you or your wife's boyfriend are fucking her that night. You will probably save a lot of money!",255,"

Hello apes, have not posted a technical analysis in a while. Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.

\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$

\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!

\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.

\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.

\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.

Please have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.

TL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr 🚀 🚀 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd",5586,"I can tell you right now, if this thing goes back to $40 I’m gonna buy so many fucking shares...",Colorful tits. I like,"Woohoo, at $348 I'll make $1 per share at that target!!!"
Technical analysis,wallstreetbets,$GME Technical Analysis: Waves go Brrr,"Hi Fam, its me, Fam. 

There is something going on with GME and it may be  **imminent**
This is my interpretation of GME thru wave counting/elliotwave. 

Refer to this image first : https://i.imgur.com/CR0OiQJ.jpg

From a yearly point of view, we have accomplished wave 1(A) and wave 2(B) colored blue for those colored blind (idk how that works). We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a *test* to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the **BIGGEST** wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several *mini* resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can *predict where Wave 3 may end* and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) 

Refer to image: https://i.imgur.com/cw86Lhx.jpg
This image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). 

On the daily,
* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start
* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves
* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. 

If this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. 

 TLDR: Wave 3's forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels. 

Im not a financially literate to be a financial advisor, but just shooting blanks, i think. My mom told me I lost a chromosome when she was dividing me during meiosis (not mitosis per SFWsosa93)  phase.

GME steadily has been producing some great gains this week, opening Monday bright and early at 154.89 and finally opening today at 269, looking poised to make our moonshot. Unfortunately, after peaking above 330, after a series of trading halts, plummeted down to 198, with restabilization by EOD.

Risk management,wallstreetbets,I just woke up literally to a margin call from risk management,"Account: https://i.imgur.com/TPFvsQ6.jpg

Was a $400k equity portfolio margin position that I bought $3.2m total of UPRO and TMF on, two 3x leveraged ETFs. 55% UPRO 45% TMF. I just rebalanced gains from TMF into UPRO  and it now blew up. 

I walked risk management through the positions. The SPX position is a short box spread financing the margin for the position. The other two positions are risk parity positions that I explained to him was much safer than the 100% stocks and  less correlation than a 50/50 stock bond portfolio. 

His response: Your ""safer"" portfolio just caused a $276k margin call.


Risk management is going to reevaluate their bond/stock correlation offsets both in general and for 3x levered ETFs. 

Anyways, I'm a bit off the hook. Since the margin loan is due to the market by 16 dec 22 and I'm getting 15k/mo tax free disability, risk management was nice enough to give me a 5 day portfolio margin call to bring the account back up to 100k positive equity. If not, the UPRO/TMF positions are liquidated, SPX remains, and I have until the date the short box spread is due. At that time I'll have a full margin call when the brokers account is on the hook. I'm down to ""risk reduction only"" trades. 

 I had to provide proof by sending in pay stubs that I really am getting $15k/mo in tax free disability insurance pay. 

So I'm going to pray portfolio goes up, otherwise whoever the fuck on the other side of my SPX box spread lending me 2.8 million at 0.85% APR to gamble on stocks is going to wish they bought US treasuries instead.

Risk management,wallstreetbets,Rules of Risk Management,"Given the current environment and with the past two days wiping out many new traders, I feel that it is appropriate to post my Rules of Risk Management, which have been requested by others on previous posts.

As a former fund manager and trader/investor with two decades of experience under my belt, here are the rules I have developed for myself concerning the trading of options:

**1) Never invest with money that you cannot afford to lose.** This is the cardinal rule of risk management.

**2) Limit your overall exposure in any single position** (this includes multiple directional positions on the same underlying) to a maximum percentage of your portfolio that does not exceed 1% for larger accounts ($100k+) and 2.5% for smaller accounts ($10k and below).

**3) Always analyze the direction of implied volatility prior to entering a trade.** Only look at debit strategies when IV percentile is low and only look at credit generating strategies when IV percentile is high. In situations where you decide to take a directional trade (bullish or bearish), the use of spreads is recommended when IV is elevated as this will negate much of the risk associated with both Vega (volatility decay) and Theta (time decay).

**4) Longer time horizons are advisable in selecting expiration dates for debit positions** and the use of shorter duration credit spreads can significantly reduce your risk, thus elevating your probability of profit.

**5) Where liquidity is concerned - only trade options that are highly liquid**, meaning that they have high open interest and, thus, tighter bid and ask spreads, which will significantly lower the slippage on each trade you take.

**6) Asymmetry of risk - only enter debit positions that offer 2 or more units of potential reward for every unit of risk.** This means that if you're risking $1 on a trade, your potential return should be at least $2. For credit positions, this is not feasible, thus, the tradeoff becomes taking in a credit with an exceptionally high probability of profit, which provides a positive expected value on the trade (for those of you unfamiliar with the term expected value - there's this thing called Google).

**7) Maintaining a cash position of greater than 50% of your portfolio value is always advisable** (I personally maintain 80% cash at all times). You never know when a position is going to go against you or when an exceptional trade/investment opportunity will arise, thus you want to be in a position of optionality with respect to taking a new favourable position or adjusting an existing one.

**8) Scale into your positions by laddering your orders.** This is especially important for those with larger account sizes since you can attain much better average prices on your positions by buying incrementally (or selling credit positions incrementally). For example, if you have $1,000 to allocate to a single position (assuming a portfolio value in excess of $100k), you can allocate $250 in 4 separate orders (or $500 in 2 separate orders). Conversely, when selling your positions, you should always scale out, which will allow you to ride your winners much longer than you normally would by incrementally taking risk off the table, which detaches you emotionally from your trade.

**9) Manage your emotions and avoid FOMO.** Option trading is a strategic game that should be done with much care, patience, and discipline. By managing your emotions and working strategically, as a trader, you will develop a pattern of decision-making, which is integral to your profitability and success over a long time horizon. FOMO is a terrible thing because it causes you to chase trades that have already passed you by. Focus on your trades, not what everyone else is doing. 

**10) Put aside money for taxes and live within your means.** Assuming you follow the above rules (and have a solid fundamental understanding of how options and the financial markets work), you should see profits in the long run, which means that you need to be disciplined in squirrelling away money for tax purposes (so that JPow and his band of merry morons can continue giving it away to those of you who are living off of everyone else). Read up on the tax laws where you reside and if you're generating enough profits, hire a proper accountant to take care of your taxes for you.

**Bonus rule:** Document all of your trades in a trade journal - if you DM me, I'd be happy to send you a copy of the excel template I use.

\-----

Godspeed and if you're serious about making your money work for you long-term instead of working for your money long-term, memorize these rules and apply them. Or don't, and continue chasing tendies like the majority of undisciplined individuals I've come across while repeatedly saying ""would you like fries with that?"".

The choice is yours.

Market trends,wallstreetbets,Understanding Market Trends,"I read a lot of posts in this sub about how retarded the rally was or how retarded bears are, and vice versa.  But I think that  known vs unknown frame is a better way to undesrtand the changes in market sentiment than bull vs bear.  

Before the virus was understood, the market fell, but during its spread, as it became better understand, the market recovered. It recovered even though it was killing thousands of people.  That seems ridiculous until you realize how institutional investors approach investing.  Massive underreaction before the virus, then massive overreaction after it. In other words, either ""Gay Bear Orgy"" or ""Stonks Go Up"".

The most important info is thus: How long does it takes big investors to realize unknown/latent factors. It took them two months to absorb the threat of the virus. To our credit, this sub was a lot quicker than most hedge funds. The problem with this sub , is that despite our retarded nature, we actually have a somewhat clear view of reality. We realize things far too quickly and react prematurely, then wonder why the market doesn't catch up.

So even though virus rates are rising, and consumer demand will not recover, and we will be in a depression for years, I am betting on calls this week and next week. Because big investors are too slow and too dull to recognize that. Just like they were months before the virus. Buy the dip.",25,"It has nothing to do with that. It was the Fed plain and simple. Compare the H.4.1 to the SNP chart. They are perfectly lined up. 

The Fed doesn't directly buy equities but it does buy treasuries and collatorialize banks and control capitalization requirements and basically the banks were given assurances that if they bought equities the fed would back them and the fed removed there capitalization requirement to 0. 

The fed has slowed down  its balance sheet and so has the market. Now JPow will go before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday to say we need more stimulus. The fed cannot in all reality print forever. They have other tools but there are huge ramifications if they print forever including the threat of the dollar not being a world reserve currency. JPow needs Congress to give more stimulus but Congress which is half controlled by Dems is critical of banks that have restricted credit access to the poor in the midst of this and want to see Trump fail. Trump tweets how well the economy is doing and Dems know if the market is bad he won't be reelected. So they probably want to reign in the fed and limit the member banks.

Market trends,wallstreetbets,Gearing Up For Future Market Trends and Preparing A Stress-Free Portfolio,"I've been studying the market across multiple sectors in the past two months. My primary focus is in the EV/Gas/Mining/Tech sector. This post might be more fitting for r/investing but I hope this can help someone on this forum as well.

First off, it's only suitable for me to preface this with a quick discussion on Tesla. I'd like to point out that Tesla's earnings report was largely good on the cashflow side, delivery + guidance numbers + margins. It's was pleasantly surprised by the cashflow since Tesla is developing gigafactories in Berlin, Shanghai, and Austin which should have tied up some of their cash, but it looks like these liabilities were deferred as debt. In terms of the carbon credits, I think this was a very strategic move to qualify for the SP500 inclusion and I previously thought it would take 2-3 months for companies to become inducted as per usual, but a lot of fund managers and analysts predict a much quick inclusion should it be approved. My price target for Tesla pre-earnings was $1350 as a I worried much of the quarter's catalysts are well baked into its current valuation, but am considering buying today's and potentially tomorrow's dip should there be one. 

On that note, I'd like to discuss the importance of being patient with the current market. I think options are great and a lot of fun, but it can hurt tremendously if you're too actively trading and without a proper set of hedging strategies to dampen the risk. That being said, lets first discuss my first pick: Nickel mining. Nickel is an incredibly important source of energy and a vital component for lithium-ion batteries. They are low in cost, but high in energy density and largely efficient. As I'm sure many of you are aware, Elon did mention Nickel's value in the ER conference call and this was preceded by many analysts having expressed interest in the Nickel mining market. 

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: Nickel demand has been growing substantially since 2016 and currently, the metrics to evaluate this demand is based on BEV\/PHEV\/Hybrid consumer data. The projections indicate nearly exponential demand curve moving into 2025 potentially as a result of automaker's shifting heavily into BEV-only cars.](https://preview.redd.it/cicbqbddfqc51.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f6f09201545d3e23d50214ddc950ef86c53eb70)

Currently, the market for precious metals are inflated obviously as a result of the rise of digital currency printing. The only issue with this is that people are speculating hyper-inflation in the forthcoming years should a vaccine fail to realize, and until some clarity is established in the coming months, I believe gold, silver, palladium, etc are all speculative metals that hold some intrinsic value. Nickel, however, is different. It is an emerging market in the precious metals category and has long been considered less valuable than its counterparts. It's only with the rise of the BEV market that people began to realize the potential and demand for Nickel. Currently, there are no environmentally sustainable ways to mine nickel as most of these metals are discovered in the form of lateritic ores, which is a combination of metals. The only way to extract pure grade nickel in this process is via large earth moving equipment + metallurgy process which has a carbon footprint. If mining companies successfully extract Nickel via more efficient means and in greater quantities, these companies will thrive in the BEV market. 

That being said, this is what you guys came for: VALE, BHP, LIT, XME in that order. VALE is the largest mining for Nickels at this moment with a low market cap. BHP is a sizeable mining corporation with the means to increase their Nickel extraction beyond that of VALE should they commit this route. LIT is the ETF for lithium batteries industry. XME is an ETF for mining companies of which many deal with Nickel extraction. Buy shares, go long, and stop stressing every 6:30am in the morning. Life is for living.

Also, cost average down on Tesla should it drop or rise. It's an attractive point still despite its high valuation. Long any energy companies associated with Tesla (i.e Sunrun, Vivint, etc. - but wait for consolidation or cost average down if you have the capital).",70,"This is why we invented blogs. Do you know what a blog is?

Yahoo bought Tumblr for 1.1 billion. It’s worth a bit less than that now","Nickel is so uncertain to invest in right now I think. The EV market is right in the middle of deciding whether to go Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) or Nickel based Li-ion (everything else). 

Tesla talked briefly on this and said they will still need nickel for high-end products like the Semi-truck, but their Shanghai Model 3 SR+ already used CATL LFP batteries. BYD, second? largest EV manufacturer after Tesla has also recently said they're abandoning all future plans of expanding nickel based Li-ion and will only be building capacity for LFP cells in the future. 

LFP is energy dense enough to power a car like Model 3/Y. To fit the long range version maybe you need to do some internal reworking but it should be in the same range. 

Imo, every car under $40k will only be using LFP, nickel will be reserved for higher end cars like the Model S/X or Semi. I don't think this demand for luxury cars is really high enough to move Nickel demand enough, stainless steel uses a ton of nickel so there's plenty of current supply that can be redirected to batteries if needed. 

https://www.adamasintel.com/lfp-market-2019-cell-to-pack-comeback/

Although, there's a chance LFP takes over the high-end market as well, it's way more thermally stable and really can't catch fire like all nickel based batteries has the potential to do. Theoretically charging with LFP can also be done much faster. A LFP Model Y should be able to be charged 10 - 80% in about 15 minutes. A nickel based Model S will need at least 30 minutes (just like smartphones). 

Would you want a 300 mile car that charges in 15 minutes, or a 500 mile car/semi that takes 30 min to charge? Are you ready to pay 2x the price for the 500 mile car? 

That said, if there's attractive, undervalued nickel, Lithium companies right now you could probably make some nice gains if they have a low market cap. For Lithium, I just think the current main way of extracting lithium by letting the sun evaporate salt water in a large pond, is kinda retarded. If there's a company that has a 21st century approach for lithium mining from salt brine, that's definitely something to look out for. 

In heavy speculation territory, finding a company that's developing ways of extraction lithium from sea water through desalination could be a niche play. Water desalination is like almost all electricity costs and today power costs are about 4x the cost of lithium. This still puts a hard upper limit on lithium prices, with lithium only being 1-3% of the battery material, manufacturers would be able to absorb the cost. 

Make a ton of cheap solar panels in hot af areas, run water desalination plants to remove salt from water, sell the clean water to local area, extract lithium from salt and sell it to Tesla, use lithium to build batteries and use them to store solar energy for night time. Use sand and electricity to build solar panels. 

That all seems like a nice sustainable loop.",Position or ban

The most amusing is the ""Fluffy Puppy"" indicator,

has consumers sharpening their budgets for the months ahead, it looks like their cuddly pets aren't immune to the cutbacks.

Over the four-weeks that ended April 9, sales of pet supplies — in other words non-food items that pets don't need to live — fell 1.9%, according to the latest data from Nielsen. That's a sharp drop-off from the 12-week average increase of 3.6%.

Pet grooming sales also plunged 19.2% while dog accessories fell 12.1% and pet bed sales declined 12.7%. The lone increase of any size came in cat litter, which saw an 11.7% gain.

Early signs of less discretionary spending on furry loved ones are a Fluffy Puppy Indicator for the health of the economy in the coming quarters. After all, who doesn't want to keep Fido happy?

stock,wallstreetbets,Robinhood Stock Lending Experience,"TLDR: How much can you make? About 0.1%. Not 1% -- 0.1% annually. Almost nothing.

I'm sharing my experience with Robinhood Stock Lending because it was very hard to find information online about how much you can make.

Robinhood states, ""... stocks with low market availability and high demand are more likely to be borrowed.""

I owned about 600 shares of a low volume stock that had a short squeeze in the month of February. It went up about 50% and had 50x more than the average volume on many of those days. Thus, I think the month of February encapsulates what would probably be the best month to loan out my stock.

Throughout February, I owned about $10k to $16k, with all shares loaned out for every day of February.

From February, I earned a whopping $1 and 36 cents (just to be clear). That's approx, conservatively a 0.16% annual rate.

So, this is nothing (at least with the amount of stock I own). And the question becomes, is it worth it for my stock to be loaned out to short sellers who are going to manipulate the stock I believe in and also apply downward price pressure? For me, that's not worth it, and I turned off stock lending.

According to Robinhood, they determine how much you make by ""a rebate rate that is 15% of the weighted average rebate rate we earned by lending that stock to borrowers on that day."" Per my understanding, this means they loaned it out with about 2.4% interest, which makes sense.

But, @ Robinhood, that's way too low. It's our money/property after all. Want us to take the risk that you default (which, check notes, [almost happened](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/27/robinhood-report-meme-stock-gamestop/#:~:text=On%20the%20morning%20of%20January,of%20the%20NSCC's%20rules%20and)) and let stock/vote manipulators bet against our own companies? 15% is too low.Robinhood Stock Lending Experience

Stock market,Forex,"Market Prediction Algorithms for the US Dollar, the Stock Market and Bitcoin","This book provides an intricate example of how to apply pattern recognition to the daily prediction of tradeable financial assets like Euro/USD and Bitcoin/USD. I demonstrate how the only way to be able to predict the price movement on a daily basis is by strictly using variations in positions of the 1. Moon, 2. Sun, 3. Mercury. & 4. Lunar nodes....and setting those variations within different parameters that call for predictions of either a price rise or fall.Using parameters that call for predictions of either up or down based on variations of the position of the sun, moon, mercury, and lunar nodes, one can find significant patterns that could lead to predicting accurately a tradeable financial asset on a daily basis for a long period of time....possibly leading to a holy grail algorithm or holy grail theory of daily trading via quantitative analysis.

The book also demonstrates how the Dow Jones Industrial Average follows a pattern based on the position of the Sun and Lunar nodes. The basic gist of the algorithm decrees that from the point when the degree of the sun is 3 degrees past(or higher than) the degree of the lunar node(in any sign) all the way until the degree of the sun enters a new sign at the 24th degree mark(using western astrology), a prediction of a market upswing should be applied. From the point when the degree of the sun enters a new sign at the 24th degree mark all the way until the degree of the sun goes 3 degrees past the degree of the lunar node(in any sign), the prediction of a market downswing should be applied.

The final volume contains the percentage ups and downs of the BTC(Bitcoin)/USD currency pair during times when the Sun and Mercury are in the same sign and also during times when the Sun and Mercury are in different signs. These statistics go back to 2012. My initial observation would conclude that there is a higher prevalence of a rise in BTC/USD when the Sun and Mercury are in different signs and a higher prevalence of a drop when the Sun and Mercury are in the same sign. Mercury retrograde periods, however, seem to reverse that pattern, making it to where the Sun and Mercury in different signs would drive the BTC/USD lower, while the Sun and Mercury in the same sign (during the retrograde) would bring it higher.

Trading strategy,Forex,Popular trading strategy category," When I started educating myself, I was in a group where owner shared courses. I watched so many courses and 99% of the courses you guys consider good are repeated contents. It's obvious those who teach don't have good ideas but copy from forums or each other. That's a high probability setup for those course makers to make money from you. Strategies always can be classified into these categories. I am not saying courses are useless but you could develop your strategy based on the category and keep it to yourself only. Because there's no holy grail and the strategy you make by your own shares the similar win rate within the category.

1. Confluence trading: (Obviously, this category could contain everything as a setup=a+b+c+d+...+z)  

   1. ex: you got liquidity grap at intraday high, then price returned to FVG, pd array, also fib 89.2 blah blah blah and don't forget we're out of 3 standard deviation of the range, now it's going to fade.
   2. ex: this level is confluence with TL, fib, ma, supply/demand, now here is a double tops/bottoms, head and shoulders...blah blah blah
2. Indicator trading:  

   1. ex: Price returned to ma, then my indicator showed me a divergence, also rsi is below 50... blah blah blah
   2. ex: Now market makers is trying to move the market, we have TDI divergence + double tops + pivot levels + correlation divergence + blah blah blah, let's hunt market makers.
3. Order flow:  

   1. ex: now price is at VAL and footprint shows aggressive sellers get trapped and DOM shows an absorption, let's get this.
   2. Big traders were at a level but they cancel their limit orders now, it is a spoofing. Let's get them.
4. Playbook:  

   1. ex: The market gives me one of my setups and I only trade setups in my playbook. If there's no setup in my playbook, then I do nothing.
5. Fundamental:  

   1. ex: lower time frames are for losers. We trade with fundamental trend, so we're with big institutional traders. Let's check the PMI report, economic data, weekly COT release and confirm them and trade setups on the HTF charts. Don't forget reading tweets and listening to your squawk. Information edge is everything.
6. Conspiracy:  

   1. ex: If I get in here, stop hunters gonna catch me. So, I wait for confirmations after the hunting. Damn, I get hunted again, my broker sabotages me. Let's only set hard stop loss where is 100 pips away to prevent extreme events. We only get out when our setup is invalid; otherwise, tell the broker freaking no!
7. Psychology:  

   1. ex: Everything works man. Let's do a meditation session and relax. Keep calm. Lose a trade? You are playing a long-term game. You get 10 losses in a streak? That's normal dude, keep your emotion calm. Let's do a yoga session. You will win one day... one day. It's all about psychology bro.

Now, you get the idea. Go to forexfactory and babypips. Check others' strategies. Modify them to whatever you like. Then, trade it on demo for 2 months. If good, live trade it.

Trading strategy,Forex,Best forex trading strategy?,"So for a while now I have been posting in this group and also reading many other subreddits to find the fundamentals of forex and the one single strategy that works the best. Lots of people recommend many different strategies and the terminology / strategies I hear the most are

* Liquidity trading
* Supply and demand
* Swing trading
* price action
* and then finally Wyckoff

So I individually researched all of these and squeezed as much info off the web as possible and for me supply and demand with price action works the best and to be honest it is the easiest of them all. I haven't actually back tested any other strategies yet. It took me so long just to find the basics of forex and just cannot understand how there isn't one single forex strategy that works for every single person when understood fully. I am finding it hard to word exactly what I mean but how come people who are getting introduced to forex can't just find the fundamentals of forex and stick to it? why do people have to make shit up like why do so many people recommend certain strategies like supply and demand but then others turn round and say its a lot of crap it doesn't work when it clearly does? 

help please",10,"There is no ""best"" trading strategy. A profitable strategy for one trader might not necessarily work out profitable for another, and that probably comes down to trading psychology of the individual

You can build them with straight arm static holds. 3 different strategies with the same end result of developing bigger biceps. This is what trading is.

You can get fancy with this by adding some weekly levels or RSI and look for some divergences. But you don't have to, just engulfing coming off 20 and 50.

You can experiment with your tf and emas, but 4h works best for me... not too slow not too fast.","From my experience (trying live some algos I have worked on), first thing is to notice a pattern that repeats frequently and does not depend so much on market changes (for example, in my case, it is breakouts of recent pivot highs and lows). Write some very specific rules (for example, consider a pivot high or low when it is the highest/lowest in a set of 20 bars, then consider a break when price reaches that exact level or a pip above/below, etc.) and then backtest it. That’s how I have been doing it and so far, even though I am still testing it live, but it is working.

Basically you first need some type of behaviour or pattern that you notice repeats often and then set rules and backtest, that is the only way to define a consistent strategy, never break your rules and if you took the time to backtest it and forward test it, then you know the stats and what you can expect.

Trading strategy,Forex,I profitably traded FX for a CTA. Here is my complete trading strategy. (Repost 4years ago)," A number of years ago I traded FX for a CTA. I achieved a return of 59.9% and my max monthly drawdown was 13.3% over about a 2 year period. Today, I'm giving away the complete strategy I built and traded to earn this return.

**Basics**

* **Why are you doing this?** I don't trade this strategy anymore due to a pivot in my trading objectives several years ago. I learned the basic concepts from others, so I'm giving back what I've received. It doesn't compete with my current style or the approach of the proprietary trading firm I work for. This strategy has sat dormant on my computer for the better part of a decade so I figured why not dust it off and pass it on. In terms of *why now*, I've noticed an uptick in strategy 101 questions on Reddit and I've started writing answers but stopped because it's just too much for a single comment. My plan is to reference this post in future interactions with traders.
* **How do we know this works?** I could show [my equity curve](https://imgur.com/bsukfTV) and I could give [you all the analytics you want](https://imgur.com/nVRdZyu). But at the end of the day, all that can be faked. My goal is to hand you something which works - provided you are looking for a method and are willing to put in the effort needed to make it work. After reading this post, there literally is nothing stopping you from adopting this, backtesting it, and trading it. So let the method speak for itself.

Let's do this thing.

**Strategy Brief**

In brief, the strategy seeks to participate in an existing trend when momentum picks up in the direction of the trend. Initial stops are tight and are trailed with pullbacks until momentum ends. I traded the strategy on the daily timeframe but it certainly could have been applied to others as well.

* [Real trade 1](https://imgur.com/gTC70wB) \- Bought into fresh with-trend momentum, sold when momentum ended
* [Real trade 2](https://imgur.com/MpDQwrp) \- Bought into fresh with-trend momentum, sold when momentum ended
* [Real trade 3](https://imgur.com/Bc6XSlg) \- Bought into fresh with-trend momentum, sold when momentum ended

There are two key concepts here - **trend** and **momentum**. Let's define them and then get into exact entry and exit techniques.

**Trend**

Put simply, a trend is when price is moving in a certain direction while price swings are in agreement with that general move.

* **Uptrend** \- in an uptrend, price swings are making higher highs and higher lowers. [Concept](https://imgur.com/vV5Mx20), [example](https://imgur.com/AxG6d7f).
* **Downtrend** \- in a downtrend, price swings are making lower lows and lower highs. [Concept](https://imgur.com/uufftph), [example](https://imgur.com/VkNs4oe).

The market doesn't always trend and there are ugly trends out there. This strategy avoids those times in which the trend is not in force to only focus on environments which favor continuation of an existing trend.

**Trend Momentum**

In any trend, there is a cycle of with trend momentum followed by against trend momentum. This forms the pattern of price pushing to fresh extremes in a trend followed by pullbacks against the trend.

When the trend re-exerts itself, you tend to see an explosion of with-trend strength. You can identify these points on a chart by ""big candles"" in the direction of the overall trend.

* [Momentum example 1](https://imgur.com/TyXwHpw) \- A downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of pullback and the continuation of the trend
* [Momentum example 2](https://imgur.com/opmuAnY) \- An uptrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and the continuation of the trend
* [Momentum example 3](https://imgur.com/EA8UQE6) \- A downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and continuation of the trend

And that's really the conceptual backdrop of the strategy: **we find a trend that is in a pullback and look to enter on fresh momentum in the direction of the trend**. You can train your eyes to spot these patterns within a couple of hours of study: it's not rocket science.

**Entry Criteria**

As per the entry, the concepts spell out precisely when to look to enter the market. Find an uptrend, look for a pullback, then buy when you get with-trend strength.

As per my specific entry criteria, I entered with a stop above the market in an uptrend or below the market in a downtrend. For example, if I identified unfolding momentum in an uptrend, I would set an entry order a few pips beyond the high to get me into the trade.

* [Example 1](https://imgur.com/a/otvbmCe) \- Buy stop set above the momentum bar in the direction of the trend
* [Example 2](https://imgur.com/WkIu6q5) \- Sell stop set below the momentum bar in the direction of the trend

**Exit: Initial Stop**

As you can see by [my win ratio](https://imgur.com/nVRdZyu) (32%), this strategy gets stopped out. A lot.

The reason for this is that I am seeking to capture the entire unfolding trend by risking only a small amount to maximize my average win / average loss ratio. The goal here is to make the reward/risk ratio such that when I actually captured a trend, it would compensate me several times over for losing trades. This is very much a trend following strategy designed to deliver outstanding returns when the market trends and scrape along when it doesn't. So the initial stop loss is very tight so as to maximize the reward per unit of risk when the trend cooperates.

For an initial stop loss, I set it roughly halfway into the width of the momentum bar. If the momentum bar is narrow in relation to the recent trading range, then I would set the stop beneath the momentum bar.

* [Example 1](https://imgur.com/wzxR1qU) \- Stop-loss set somewhere near the middle of the candle
* [Example 2](https://imgur.com/QHDW177) \- Stop-loss set somewhere near the middle of the candle

**Exit: Trailing Profit**

The stop loss remains in place until the market forms and completes a pullback in the trend. When a pullback has been completed and the trend continues, the stop loss is moved to the bottom of the pullback in an uptrend or the top of the pullback in a downtrend. This process is repeated until the stop is hit and you are taken out of the trade. In other words, you have very high upside potential on each trade with constrained (but much more probable) risk.

* [Concept](https://imgur.com/a/3uDLyrT) \- Trailing stops are set beneath pullbacks when a pullback completes by pushing into new highs. This process is repeated until you are stopped out.
* [Example trade 1](https://imgur.com/a/kDhejsZ) \- This looks complicated, but it's really not. Every time the market forms a pullback of 2 or more bars, we wait until price closes beyond the pullback in the direction of the trend and then move our stop to the bottom of the pullback.

**Risk Management**

To protect against losses, I risked a firm 1% per trade. If my initial stop was hit, I would trade at such a size that I would lose 1% of my account balance. No exceptions.

The reason here is that with a trend following strategy under this risk/reward framework, you are going to lose a lot. You need to ensure that you can survive 10+ losses straight with minimal dent to your trading book and you only do this through risk management.

**Indicators for Screening**

If you notice on my charts which show actual trades, I had the 10 period moving average and the 200 moving average overlaid on the chart. The reason for this is that I used the 10 period SMA as an scanning indicator and the 200 as a general reference for the trend.

* **10 period SMA** \- I used this indicator to screen for momentum bars. Example: If today's close is the first close above the SMA and we're closing in the top 25% of the candle, then visually inspect the chart to see if we're in a trend and this is fresh momentum in the direction of the trend.
* **200 period SMA** \- This indicator gave me a quick at-a-glance metric to give context to my trend analysis. If I viewed price as in a trend, I wanted it to be above the 200 as a loose confirmation that the general trend was indeed upwards.

My primary focus was on price action: **find a trend, trade fresh with-trend momentum when it appears and then ride the trend until it ends**. The indicators simply served as a helpful scanning tool and you can trade the method without them.

**----Practical Considerations for Real Trading---**

**Practice and Trade Review**

You have to internalize this to actually identify it in real time if you want to adopt this strategy. You do this through backtesting and verification that your live testing is lining up with your backtest.

* **Backtesting** \- I spent hundreds of hours dragging charts one bar at a time and recording trades that I would have taken if it were real-time. On an ongoing basis I would backtest / back-trade the past decade of data for every instrument I traded. This practically meant that I was spending 90% of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and 5-10% of my time actually trading. If you haven't quite figured out trading, I'd suggest you put in serious effort into the area of backtest and intentional practice.
* **Trade Review** \- On an ongoing basis I would do a complete review of all of my trades to figure out how to sharpen my edge and to verify that I was perfectly trading my plan. [Here's a screenshot from just one of these sessions](https://imgur.com/wBKLmXB). No matter your strategy, I believe trade review is crucial. How will you know if you're making mistakes if you're not reviewing what you've done? How will you know if you can do better if you're not carefully questioning each and every trade to try and get better? This sheet has several more columns and was just one iteration of an ongoing review process.

If this seems like a lot of work, that's the point. You are competing against some of the brightest minds in the world. Why would the market allow trading to be as easy as opening an app on your way to the beach? To profitability trade, you really need to invest heavily in 1) verifying that what you're doing has a history of making money and 2) verifying that you're actually executing in perfect alignment with your testing as well as looking for ways to improve performance. You'll always see the lucky dude flaunting his returns, but for the vast majority of professional traders, this is just scratching the surface of the types of analysis you need to do to monitor and improve your discretionary trading edge.

**Psychology**

There's no getting around it, trading is psychologically difficult for many people. My two ""silver bullets"" are **an edge** and **a desire to succeed**.

* **You must have an edge**. First off, do you have an edge? Unless you have a either a demonstrated track record of making money or a backtest of your exact method showing that it makes money, then you'll probably have mental angst. Even with my trades resting on hundreds of hours of study and backtesting demonstrating the validity of my method, it was still difficult to pull the trigger and take the next trade at times. Knowing I had a demonstrated edge is what gave me the confidence to overcome mental angst and put on the next trade.
* **You must have a desire to succeed**. And second bullet is this: do you want to succeed? If you have a demonstrated edge and have a rock solid conviction and drive to succeed, then a lot of psychological issues take care of themselves. I remember the pain of sitting in a prolonged drawdown after losing several trades in a row. It was a defining moment for me. It is a unique pain that words can't quite capture. In the depths of the pain of losing trade after trade (and in the process worrying if I'd lose my job), I reminded myself that 1) I have an edge and 2) I really want to succeed at this. So I picked myself back up and took the next trade. And over the next few months I delivered some of my strongest returns and broke into new equity highs.

In my opinion, people get the cart before the horse in the territory of psychology. ""Trading gurus"" seem to suggest that if you get your mindset aligned, money will just flow into your account. That's simply not the case if the places in which you are buying and selling have zero demonstrated ability to actually make money. Step 1, get a demonstrated edge. Step 2, ensure you're able to act on that edge through proper psychology.

**An Edge**

The expected value equation is the foundation of trading. Put simply:

* **Expected value** = Win Percentage x Average Win Size + Loss Percentage \* Average Loss Size

If that equation is negative, you don't have an edge. If it's positive, you have an edge. If you play around with the math, you'll see that **win ratio or average win / loss size in isolation are irrelevant**. You can have a high win ratio with large losers or a low win ratio with large winners and have the exact same mathematical edge. The only thing you're varying is the distribution of your returns.

My strategy detailed above is a positive skew strategy. Lots of small losses and a few very large wins. You can adapt it by either larger stops or adding targets to change your distribution of returns. The underlying edge is real: markets trend and at certain points you can participate in them to outperform the baseline drift of the market. How you size your targets and stops shapes the ultimate distribution of returns you will receive as you capture this edge.

**Further Reading**

For those who have traded for a while, everything I said above probably clicks and makes sense. But if this was like me speaking an entirely different language, here's some books that are simply excellent for discretionary trading.

* **The Art and Science of Technical Analysis - Adam Grimes**. This book will carefully show you how to read market structure and give strategies for trading it. Grimes is the real-deal and his anti-hype levelheadedness is much needed in trading literature. If you can only afford one book, make it this one.
* **The Psychology of Trading - Dr. Brett Steenbarger**. Hands down the best psychology book out there in my view. Steenbarger (a professional psychologist who has worked at the institutional level of trading) is who fixed my thinking on trading psychology to where I focused on getting an edge first and foremost and then aligning my psychology so that I can act on my edge.

**Conclusion**

Take it or leave it, there's a complete discretionary trading strategy which was used at the professional level of the field of speculative FX trading. This is one of many approaches out there and if you're looking for a strategy, feel free to take this one and experiment with it. Best of luck in all of your endeavors.",99,"Great summary, this is the real strategy for all you newbies out there

>As you can see by my win ratio (32%), this strategy gets stopped out. A lot.

* Negative win rate and still profitable (yes, this is probably one of the only ways to consistently make money - you lose quite often but when you win you cover all your losses and some more - **forget** about strategies which have RR higher than 1:2 and winrate higher than 50%)

> I was spending 90% of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and 5-10% of my time actually trading.

* Finally. This is what trading is about - its a numbers game and **a lot** of awful, boring and mentally exhausting work. The actual trading / monitoring needs **very little** time. Entries are not that important (especially all those *sniper* entries - that is just **pure gambling** and nothing more), exit strategy is. Because noone knows how strong the trend will be once it starts. Who would say 10 days ago that gold would suddenly make **12000** pips in a week?

Now, the next step for this (or any) strategy would be to show people how to actually **optimize** the strategy (optimization = **finding optimal stop loss and take profit values** for the data set created by the strategy, expanding strategy to other assets). This can be easily done in any sheets program like excel or google sheets once you enter all the data from backtest.",We need more people to post stuff like this and not just PL screenshots. Thanks for showing people a potentially useful strategy.,I have a similar algo to trade like this even recently. Confirm it worked but it really depends on which instruments will get the most out of profit. For me it will be US30 and US100. Actually it will be the best if you can combine this breakout strategy with a mean reversion strategy to smooth out DD.
Trading strategy,Forex,"Is ""feeling it"" a trading strategy?","I mean you always hear you need to have strategy, but I wonder if there is anyone else like me that kinda just feels it and enters based on gut feeling and some basic resistances.",3,"Some argue it's the only real way to be profitable. I dont necessarily agree, but I have had thoughts about those being profitable with systems are more dependant on their feel and experience than the actual system without  realizing it to the full extent themselves.","Feeling is emotional. A better way to describe it would be experience. When you first start driving you will have to really focus to keep the car straight between the lines, watch your mirrors and maintain speed. Once you've been driving for a while it becomes second nature. You've gained experience. Like trading this doesn't apply to everyone 😂

After years of trading I now see setups and know. That's experience because I've seen them play out time and again.","Kind of. 
I am trading for 11, almost 12 years now.
I've gotten a pretty good feeling for US indices and often can tell with the last couple candles what will happen. Often you can recognize pressure building and unloading into a direction.
It's not a strategy but most of my trades start with ""ah yes Nasdaq wants to go through that level"""
Trading strategy,Forex,"My forex trading strategy works, but doesn't. Any advice?","So the first time I traded with a strategy was with doyle exchange's course 2 years ago (uses supply/demand (S/D) zones with breaks of structure, liquidity and gaps as confluence). I found short term success, but didn't have strict rules/my psychology was bad, and holiday season lowered my win%. I fell in love with doyle's method of trading but struggled to make it work for me. And yes I tried his discord group for a while and long story short it didn't help enough.

I started only trading NAS. I focused on High probability (HP) S/D zones and liquidity grabs sweeps/reversals at the NYSE open, taking most of the setups that occurred. It's Sept 2022 ish and I started backtesting and building a trading plan. I found the app ""airtable"" and still use it to this day to record my trades. The more forward/backtesting I did, the more details I started paying attention to, the more confusing my research/strategy got. I wasn't recording effectively/tracking trade characteristics separately and therefor couldn't analyze the data very well, on top of realizing that trading the NYSE open is risky, has many fake-outs, and isn't back-testable since it goes back and forth in seconds.

I took a break during holiday szn and Feb 2023 I was back at the drawing board. I began looking at NAS, GU, EU, and AU, and how I could filter out the ""bad"" trades. I always traded the 5m, but now used 1H and 15m as confluence, looking at highs, lows(liquidity), and gaps as profit targets rather than amount of money. By march I realized the higher time frames confused me and I had no idea what a ""good"" vs ""bad"" trade was. I backtested NAS, EU, UJ, GU and every setup that occured from Jan-march 2023, constructed a trading plan, and by May 2023 was ready to forward test on only UJ and GU, but still record every trade from NAS and EU as well to have more data. 

My whole journey I had psychology trouble choosing what setups to take or avoid. I will attach a pic of my trading plan and an example or 2 (follow me on IG @ shambpagne if you wanna see summaries of my trading since MAy) but I was focused on removing the decision making in trading, using data to create rules that filtered my trades so I could simply take every trade I saw that fit the criteria, win or lose. My psychology since has been great. 700 recorded trades later, the strategy has been profitable the past 6 months on paper, averages around 20 trades a week, survived a slump in June/July w/o losing most of profits gained in April/May, and has been tweaked a lil bit based on the data I have analyzed. 

That all sounds good but Have I been profitable forward testing this strat? Not exactly. In May I was breaking rules and in most of June/July/august I was moving into an apt, travelling, working, and only back tested. I have forward tested all Sept 2023 and realized I haven't been tracking NEWS and it can only really be recorded when you forward test and see the affects real-time. So I'm sure a nice chunk of the profits I've recorded wouldn't exist bc of NEWS. I never took NEWS into account since it seemed to go in my favor almost just as much as it didn't. Since I've been forward testing and holding my trades through NEWS, I realize it's not realistic to think I will be able to consistently take profits in the mere seconds I have during a NEWs candle or that I won't lose more money than my SL says I will cus volatility. I decided to just start closing trades right before news hits but I also realized commissions are kinda fucking me over. I was up about 2.5% this past week on paper risking 1%/trade but only actually made 1%. There's no way of telling in the 700 trades I recorded how much profits would've been erased from commissions, but obviously a nice chunk it seems.

So now here I am, rethinking the past 6 months I have spent dialing in on this strategy I'm comfortable using, wondering how much of it was a waste. I don't really want to switch strategies and have another learning curve. My data shows that there's only a couple more ways to filter out bad trades and increase win% (around 60% rn), but I know the filtering would require me to start making decisions and could hurt my psychology and it honestly doesn't seem worth it since I would lose alot of profits on paper for a small win% increase. I have heard there are no commissions for trading NAS, but my strat straight up sucks on NAS and I can't go back to what I was doing before since it wasn't working. I understand swing trading would kinda eliminate this problem but I hate swing trading, I'm a scalper at heart.

I am going to keep forward testing the strat and I do still have confidence I will have enough profits in the long run to cover for all the commissions, but it is a bit troublesome. Anyone else dealt with this issue? Any advice on what to do moving forward assuming my strat won't provide enough in the long term? 

TLDR/ I trade Supply/demand zones using liquidity and gaps as targets on UJ and GU on the 5m. The strategy I have built around my psychology over the years takes about 20 trades a week and I'm recently realizing commissions might be my downfall.

In the picture, AGG = aggressive entry (tapping a zone), BOC = break of candle (reversal confirmation)",0,"I see you mention news few times. Often news doesn't change the trajectory but merely provides volatility or fuel to fire. Should always be aware of whats going on. Just a general observation but if you are having trouble with commissions, maybe you are overtrading. Have you tried increasing your time frame or limiting your trading in some way? Can take a long time of fine tuning to match your personality with the market when finding your way. Dedication, commitment, and patience can help guide you","there is this one article online that stood out to me completely and really helped me find the best setups, only take a supply and demand trade when the supply is extremely clear-im talking consecutive solid candle colors for the supply thats created and for the demand also that is created before entry. There must be a very clear demand that is created before considering entry. not all that liquidity crap and then some candle touching the zone. Must be clear as day and if its not clear on the 5min, could be more clear on the 1 min or 15min. But 5min is always the timeframe where I start. I won’t even take a setup if there is a candle of the opposite color interferring with the supply or demand. Ive never seen this talked about anywhere besides this only article on google and it definitely helps to not overtrade. Ive also started implementing daily bias so the direction of the s/d zone has to be in line with that because if its not, more than likely the setup will fail and not reach liquidity of the zone where i take profit. Since my setups have become so selective I do have to trade on more than one pair. I ignore news except nfp i have noticed any setup that looks good on that day does more than likely fail or zones just fail and don’t even get touched 

ive been following doyle for awhile on ig and watch his stories everyday to see if we had similar setups. ive pretty much figured out his strat just from studying s&d myself and his tips he says in his vids. some trades he does definitely has me scratching my head like when he takes a demand trade to a supply. I don’t even want to try getting my head wrapped around that lol but for exiting early I had to learn how to do that on my own as well as his vid describing that, if you did what he did you’d have a ton of losses and miss out on winning trades. It looks like he cuts them as soon as a candle goes in opposite direction before it even closes…. but thats how the market flows and if your setup is good most of the time that candle wont close above your entry candle

my stop loss is above the zone and i close early if any candle closes above the open of my entry candle- has cut my losses down by less than half instead of taking a full hit. your welcome for that one!!! lol

I have a lot of rules that I haven’t listed here but I think that’s honestly what it takes. having a lot of clear and defined rules so there’s no guessing


*ive been studying forex everyday since sept 2022, do not give up!! all the time and energy will be worth it. When people give up that’s usually when they are right on the verge of finding success","If you're not willing to go up a timeframe, which will give you fewer trades, you're probably going to need to get a better R:R somehow.

It's been my experience that trading anything under the 15m chart is way too much trouble than it's worth precisely because of commissions and spreads, and personally I rarely trade under the 1 hour.

I usually ignore news unless it's something of vital importance like a national bank making some huge announcement, even then I'm just slightly more cautious."

2) Also look at options on ETFs that track currencies..the FXE is optionable for instance. Other companies do this but you can peek at the group behind FXE to see their other offerings: [link](http://currencyshares.com/products/overview.rails?symbol=FXE)

3) When googling around, you will run into binary options brokers from all over the world. **Stay the hell away from binary options!** They are a betting tool, not a trading tool, and are structurally designed to put the odds in the house's favor. Even if the broker is state side and is well regulated.. it's still a betting product in the end. To date, the only legit traders I know who've made money from Binaries were people exploiting a broker's erroneous pricing and could arb out the difference.

4) While some brokers offer OTC vanilla options that you trade against them as the counterparty, they are often very limited in selection and have wide spreads... you'll have a hard time paying the fair price (that means implied fair value, or being filled at a price between the bid and ask) going the OTC route at a retail FX broker because they'll likely only execute when you cross the spread or the market moves through your order. Sadly, until there's more competition on the retail level for OTC vanilla options, this is not gonna change. (Examples here are IG and Saxo.. neither I would recommend.) So stick with points 1 and 2 for exchange traded options.

5) There is also options on currency futures. The exposure on these is a lot, a LOT, higher than a single contract on ISE for their equity option style contracts.

",Trading volatility especially in spot vols is a lot different than trading the underlying. If you know the Greeks and how options and volatility is priced then you will be fine but if you don't learn it first. You also have to know which options structure gives you the best expression(ex: if skew is out of whack or you are worried about basis risk then you buy the risk reversals and then the complete opposite for the butterflies). There are times tho it makes more sense to express in spot over vols so you don't have to change what you've been doing. Your just adding a new tool to the box. If your long gamma your losers will be relatively safer than your underlying positions and if your short it in the wrong environment then your position is far more dangerous then being in the underlying.

If you want to understand the macro economics (where you will find your biggest edge in my experience) and you are a chad, I’d read wealth of nations by Adam smith to start.","Forex market is driven mostly by 2 factors (INTEREST RATES & INFLATION)

There are actually 5 factors to keep track of - checkout these YT SHORTs.


Don't try to be an economist, just learn the minimum which impact trading markets. 

I reference these thesw videos all the time for easy recall.

I use two easy lists as my goto guide for what fundamentals affects FX market.

LIST#1 - https://youtube.com/shorts/3qDay26TsDo

- economic indicators, 
- monetary policy, 
- aggregate supply-demand, 
- high&low yield currencies and
- Sentiment & intermarket analysis
.

LIST#2 - https://youtube.com/shorts/chvbKMQDrJQ

- exports/imports, 
- economic indicators, 
- financial attractiveness, 
- central bank policy, 
- state of country's reserves

Can u see the overlap? The minimum?

At the highest level the strength of an economy is based on domestic & foreign factors to country.

- Strong Country strength = Strong FX value
- Weak Country strength = Weak FX value
.
- country strength comes from DOMESTIC MONEY [productivity inside country & resulting GDP]
- country strength from FOREIGN MONEY [international investment into country increasing productivity])

Interest rates & inflation drive currency strength & hence FX market.

COMPARE : High interests rates Vs middle rates Vs low interest rates

COMPARE : High inflation Vs middle inflation Vs low inflation 

INTEREST RATES are used by a country's CENTRAL BANK to control the strength of country (= currency value in fx markets)

ALWAYS remember the central banks role is 4 fold

(1) set MONETARY POLICY & 
(2) MONITOR ECONOMY is on track (using economic indicators)
(3) STABILISE currency value 
(4) CONTROL FLOW OF MONEY in-out of country 

- I paraphrased here is fuller list https://byjus.com/commerce/functions-of-the-central-bank/
- if it's not overkill 3 websites support Ur FX fundamentals https://youtube.com/shorts/nBP2evQp4_M

INFLATION is the Price difference btwn SUPPLY & DEMAND at country level (high inflation= bigger difference btwn S&D, lower inflation=smaller difference btwn S&D)

High interest rates (=GOOD for borrowing, BAD for loans/ investment ) Vs middle interest rate (=GOOD, GOOD) Vs low interest rate (=BAD for borrowing, GOOD for loans/ investment)

Inflation in middle (=GOOD for country), inflation at extremes (too low inflation or too high inflation = BAD for country)

Now hopefully u can see fx currency market is a direct insight into a country's strength

while 5 main levers represent FX fundamentals really only 2 levers (indicators :interest rates & inflation) do the heavy lifting in moving fx market

Fundamental analysis,Forex,"Fellow forex traders (beginners especially), do your fundamental analysis.","I started trading by learning technical analysis, I didn't do too well with that, and as soon as I started doing my fundamental analysis, my learning curve peaked. I also got a lot more consistent with my profit. 

if you are a technical analysis only trader and that works for you, that's great. I have nothing against that, but if you been grinding technical analysis and it didn't well, or you just began trading, fundamental analysis might very well be what you needed. 

Even if you're profitable with just technical analysis, from my very own experience, without fundamental, you could be missing half of the picture, or not able to understand what's causing these movement.

They should be knowledgeable in finance and economy, not just some rando with a YouTube account. Also, be aware that none of them can predict the future, but when you read/ heard from enough of them, you will gain a lot of insight into market sentiment, on what condition are they looking to buy and sell.

This would make sense imo since currencies are much stronger than stocks/options and are backed by literal countries/regions so I can’t imagine too much movement would result from fundamentals (unless it was particularly catalyzing news) so most traders would defer to technical data and trading instead.

If my capital is of $100, and I would like to risk 1% on a trade, would I execute a trade using 1% or should the amount I would lose if the trade hit stop loss be 1%?

bump the capital to 2000, and only using 1%, that's $20, divide 2000 by 20, that's 100 trades in that account not accounting for margin calls and stop out ofcourse.

using 2% will give you 50 trades of that capital. All you now need to do based on this is make a strategy that if you trade 100 times, at the end of 100 trades you profit more than loss.

this is just an example.  the capital could be larger but the 100 - 50 trade (1-2% risk management) is constant. 5% makes the number of trade even less.

# Letting stops breathe

We talked earlier about giving a position enough room to breathe so it is not stopped out in day-to-day noise.

Let’s consider the chart below and imagine you had a trailing stop. It would be super painful to miss out on the wider move just because you left a stop that was too tight.

&#x200B;

[Imagine being long and stopped out on a meaningless retracement ... ouch!](https://preview.redd.it/7eiqkd39zjh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efd6d24cc8a43c5a4679261313f6e40a8f7bed4)

One simple technique is simply to look at your chosen chart - let’s say daily bars. And then look at previous trends and use the measuring tool. Those generally look something like this and then you just click and drag to measure.

For example if we wanted to bet on a downtrend on the chart above we might look at the biggest retracement on the previous uptrend. That max drawdown was about 100 pips or just under 1%. So you’d want your stop to be able to withstand at least that. 

If market conditions have changed - for example if CVIX has risen - and daily ranges are now higher you should incorporate that. If you know a big event is coming up you might think about that, too. The human brain is a remarkable tool and the power of the eye-ball method is not to be dismissed. This is how most discretionary traders do it.

There are also more analytical approaches.

Some look at the Average True Range (ATR). This attempts to capture the volatility of a pair, typically averaged over a number of sessions. It looks at three separate measures and takes the largest reading. Think of this as a moving average of how much a pair moves.

For example, below shows the daily move in EURUSD was around 60 pips before spiking to 140 pips in March. Conditions were clearly far more volatile in March. Accordingly, you would need to leave your stop further away in March and take a correspondingly smaller position size.

&#x200B;

[ATR is available on pretty much all charting systems](https://preview.redd.it/wr8939dczjh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cef3e5ee08a22c287b925546b8374fe491088f9)

Professional traders tend to use standard deviation as a measure of volatility instead of ATR. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Averages are useful but can be misleading when regimes switch (see above chart).

Once you have chosen a measure of volatility, stop distance can then be back-tested and optimised. For example does 2x ATR work best or 5x ATR for a given style and time horizon? 

Discretionary traders may still eye-ball the ATR or standard deviation to get a feeling for how it has changed over time and what ‘normal’ feels like for a chosen study period - daily, weekly, monthly etc. 

&#x200B;

# Reasons to change a stop

As a general rule you should be disciplined and not change your stops. Remember - losers average losers. This is really hard at first and we’re going to look at that in more detail later.

There are some good reasons to modify stops but they are rare.

One reason is if another risk management process demands you stop trading and close positions. We’ll look at this later. In that case just close out your positions at market and take the loss/gains as they are.

Another is event risk. If you have some big upcoming data like Non Farm Payrolls that you know can move the market +/- 150 pips and you have no edge going into the release then many traders will take off or scale down their positions. They’ll go back into the positions when the data is out and the market has quietened down after fifteen minutes or so. This is a matter of some debate - many traders consider it a coin toss and argue you win some and lose some and it all averages out.

Trailing stops can also be used to ‘lock in’ profits. We looked at those before. As the trade moves in your favour (say up if you are long) the stop loss ratchets with it. This means you may well end up ‘stopping out’ at a profit - as per the below example.

&#x200B;

[The mighty trailing stop loss order](https://preview.redd.it/v1o6brjzzjh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a022097ae7252ce1c526b3ae41128cd5da509c12)

It is perfectly reasonable to have your stop loss move in the direction of PNL. This is not exposing you to more risk than you originally were comfortable with. It is taking less and less risk as the trade moves in your favour. Trend-followers in particular love trailing stops.

One final question traders ask is what they should do if they get stopped out but still like the trade. Should they try the same trade again a day later for the same reasons? Nope. Look for a different trade rather than getting emotionally wed to the original idea.

Let’s say a particular stock looked cheap based on valuation metrics yesterday, you bought, it went down and you got stopped out. Well, it is going to look even better on those same metrics today. Maybe the market just doesn’t respect value at the moment and is driven by momentum. Wait it out.

Otherwise, why even have a stop in the first place?

# Entering and exiting winning positions

Take profits are the opposite of stop losses. They are also  resting orders, left with the broker, to automatically close your position if it reaches a certain price. 

Imagine I’m long EURUSD at 1.1250. If it hits a previous high of 1.1400 (150 pips higher) I will leave a sell order to take profit and close the position.

The rookie mistake on take profits is to take profit too early. One should start from the assumption that you will win on no more than half of your trades. Therefore you will need to ensure that you win more on the ones that work than you lose on those that don’t. 

&#x200B;

[Sad to say but incredibly common: retail traders often take profits way too early](https://preview.redd.it/ei0dpp4o0kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=79ac49994ce98a28b5e6c397161e292fad7b522d)

This is going to be the exact opposite of what your emotions want you to do. We are going to look at that in the *Psychology of Trading* chapter.

Remember: let winners run. Just like stops you need to know in advance the level where you will close out at a profit. Then let the trade happen. Don’t override yourself and let emotions force you to take a small profit. A classic mistake to avoid.

The trader puts on a trade and it almost stops out before rebounding. As soon as it is slightly in the money they spook and cut out, instead of letting it run to their original take profit. Do not do this.

## Entering positions with limit orders

That covers exiting a position but how about getting into one?

Take profits can also be left speculatively to enter a position. Sometimes referred to as “bids” (buy orders) or “offers” (sell orders). Imagine the price is 1.1250 and the recent low is 1.1205. 

You might wish to leave a bid around 1.2010 to enter a long position, if the market reaches that price. This way you don’t need to sit at the computer and wait.

Again, typically traders will use tech analysis to identify attractive levels. Again - other traders will cluster with your orders. Just like the stop loss we need to bake that in. 

So this time if we know everyone is going to buy around the recent low of 1.1205 we might leave the take profit bit a little bit above there at 1.1210 to ensure it gets done. Sure it costs 5 more pips but how mad would you be if the low was 1.1207 and then it rallied a hundred points and you didn’t have the trade on?!

There are two more methods that traders often use for entering a position.

Scaling in is one such technique. Let’s imagine that you think we are in a long-term bulltrend for AUDUSD but experiencing a brief retracement. You want to take a total position of 500,000 AUD and don’t have a strong view on the current price action.

You might therefore leave a series of five bids of 100,000. As the price moves lower each one gets hit. The nice thing about scaling in is it reduces pressure on you to pick the perfect level. Of course the risk is that not all your orders get hit before the price moves higher and you have to trade at-market.

Pyramiding is the second technique. Pyramiding is for take profits what a trailing stop loss is to regular stops. It is especially common for momentum traders.

&#x200B;

[Pyramiding into a position means buying more as it goes in your favour](https://preview.redd.it/mqa3a7ov0kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6212ac0598e6a4f71ab9b883bed5432815f5d8c7)

Again let’s imagine we’re bullish AUDUSD and want to take a position of 500,000 AUD.

Here we add 100,000 when our first signal is reached. Then we add subsequent clips of 100,000 when the trade moves in our favour. We are waiting for confirmation that the move is correct.

Obviously this is quite nice as we humans love trading when it goes in our direction. However, the drawback is obvious: we haven’t had the full amount of risk on from the start of the trend.

You can see the attractions and drawbacks of both approaches. It is best to experiment and choose techniques that work for your own personal psychology as these will be the easiest for you to stick with and build a disciplined process around.

# Risk:reward and win ratios

Be extremely skeptical of people who claim to win on 80% of trades. Most traders will win on roughly 50% of trades and lose on 50% of trades. This is why risk management is so important!

Once you start keeping a trading journal you’ll be able to see how the win/loss ratio looks for you. Until then, assume you’re typical and that every other trade will lose money.

If that is the case then you need to be sure you make more on the wins than you lose on the losses. You can see the effect of this below.

&#x200B;

[A combination of win &#37; and risk:reward ratio determine if you are profitable](https://preview.redd.it/3t36hyk81kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf08eda09aabfea07a6922cb46e0d6fbaad2b8f)

A typical rule of thumb is that a ratio of 1:3 works well for most traders. 

That is, if you are prepared to risk 100 pips on your stop you should be setting a take profit at a level that would return you 300 pips. 

One needn’t be religious about these numbers - 11 pips and 28 pips would be perfectly fine  - but they are a guideline. 

Again - you should still use technical analysis to find meaningful chart levels for both the stop and take profit. Don’t just blindly take your stop distance and do 3x the pips on the other side as your take profit. Use the ratio to set approximate targets and then look for a relevant resistance or support level in that kind of region.

# Risk-adjusted returns

Not all returns are equal. Suppose you are examining the track record of two traders. Now, both have produced a return of 14% over the year. Not bad!

The first trader, however, made hundreds of small bets throughout the year and his cumulative PNL looked like the left image below.

The second trader made just one bet — he sold CADJPY at the start of the year — and his PNL looked like the right image below with lots of large drawdowns and volatility.

[Would you rather have the first trading record or the second?](https://preview.redd.it/ow3d5m2d1kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=553ca2af562e95bda44d6d2b291fa963089e36f4)

If you were investing money and betting on who would do well next year which would you choose? Of course all sensible people would choose the first trader. Yet if you look only at returns one cannot distinguish between the two. Both are up 14% at that point in time. This is where the Sharpe ratio helps .

A high Sharpe ratio indicates that a portfolio has better risk-adjusted performance. One cannot sensibly compare returns without considering the risk taken to earn that return. 

If I can earn 80% of the return of another investor at only 50% of the risk then a rational investor should simply leverage me at 2x and enjoy 160% of the return at the same level of risk.

This is very important in the context of Execution Advisor algorithms (EAs) that are popular in the retail community. You must evaluate historic performance by its risk-adjusted return — not just the nominal return. Incidentally look at the Sharpe ratio of ones that have been live for a year or more ...

Otherwise an EA developer could produce two EAs: the first simply buys at 1000:1 leverage on January 1st ; and the second sells in the same manner. At the end of the year, one of them will be discarded and the other will look incredible. Its risk-adjusted return, however, would be abysmal and the odds of repeated success are similarly poor.

## Sharpe ratio

The Sharpe ratio works like this: 

* It takes the average returns of your strategy;
* It deducts from these the risk-free rate of return i.e. the rate anyone could have got by investing in US government bonds with very little risk;
* It then divides this total return by its own volatility - the more smooth the return the higher and better the Sharpe, the more volatile the lower and worse the Sharpe.

For example, say the return last year was 15% with a volatility of 10% and US bonds are trading at 2%. That gives (15-2)/10 or a Sharpe ratio of 1.3. As a rule of thumb a Sharpe ratio of above 0.5 would be considered decent for a discretionary retail trader. Above 1 is excellent.

You don’t really need to know how to calculate Sharpe ratios. Good trading software will do this for you. It will either be available in the system by default or you can add a plug-in.

## VAR

VAR is another useful measure to help with drawdowns. It stands for Value at Risk. Normally people will use 99% VAR (conservative) or 95% VAR (aggressive). Let’s say you’re long EURUSD and using 95% VAR. The system will look at the historic movement of EURUSD. It might spit out a number of -1.2%.

&#x200B;

[A 5&#37; VAR of -1.2&#37; tells you you should expect to lose 1.2&#37; on 5&#37; of days, whilst 95&#37; of days should be better than that](https://preview.redd.it/jos9ubtl1kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b5c92d3525a68409b9bb0f38fe6e7305184163)

This means it is expected that on 5 days out of 100 (hence the 95%) the portfolio will lose 1.2% or more. This can help you manage your capital by taking appropriately sized positions. Typically you would look at VAR across your portfolio of trades rather than trade by trade.

Sharpe ratios and VAR don’t give you the whole picture, though. Legendary fund manager, Howard Marks of Oaktree, notes that, while tools like VAR and Sharpe ratios are helpful and absolutely necessary, the best investors will also overlay their own judgment. 

*Investors can calculate risk metrics like VaR and Sharpe ratios (we use them at Oaktree; they’re the best tools we have), but they shouldn’t put too much faith in them. The bottom line for me is that risk management should be the responsibility of every participant in the investment process, applying experience, judgment and knowledge of the underlying investments.Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital*

What he’s saying is don’t misplace your common sense. Do use these tools as they are helpful. However, you cannot fully rely on them. Both assume a normal distribution of returns. Whereas in real life you get “black swans” - events that should supposedly happen only once every thousand years but which actually seem to happen fairly often. 

These outlier events are often referred to as “tail risk”. Don’t make the mistake of saying “well, the model said…” - overlay what the model is telling you with your own common sense and good judgment.

Market trends,Forex,AUD/USD MARKET TRENDS-The AUD/USD remains bearish.,"&#x200B;

[AUD\/USD TECHNICAL GRAPH WITH SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LINES](https://preview.redd.it/gye7snfp1cr41.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8803a7bc5c77331c04cd70a0dfe1a3df48faa58)

The AUD/USD currency pair started 2020 with a drastic down pull form January high and traded below the 0.6900 handle and the 50/200-day SMAs. As of January, the Australian dollar was seen to be under bearish pressure below the 0.6890 resistance and the 200 SMA when viewed on a four-hour chart. The AUD/USD currency pair is currently bleeding downwards as COVID-19 crisis grips. The currency pair traded at 0.6554 and -0.73 percent in February which recorded a drop from 0.6607 to 0.6551 as the market trends expect downside risks as a result of coronavirus pandemic crisis and reduced demand from China. 

The currency pair has been on a straight lain wreck for the bulls, every measure put together to correct this outcome have been completely thwarted due to media reports on the increased risk on the global economy and world market trade as coronavirus escalated to all corners of the world. As of now, as much as 78 percent of exports makes its way to Asia while the RBA’s clears every reluctance to cut rates. This led support to the AUD where market pricing is kept at a cut to 0.5 percent below 50 percent until May.

When it comes to trading the AUD/USD, every technical chart, both monthly and weekly indicates that we are at the end of the line for a longer-term down hit, therefore, extreme caution should be taken by every trader in the market in accordance to analysts. 

As of last week, in the month of March 2020, the AUD/USD climbed to 6.1 percent which marked a cross over to 0.61 level.  The Australian manufacturing PMI made a hit from 49.8 in February to 50.1 in the month of March. This figure indicates stagnation in the manufacturing sector where the PMI fell from 48.4 to 39.8. In a second look around, the United States highlight brought forth a staggering figure for unemployment claims which was 3.2 million caused by the lockdown of factories and business across the nation. There was a decline in the ISM Manufacturing PMI from 50.8 in February to 49.2 this march. Durable goods orders became a mix in February where the headline figures increased from -0.2 percent to 1.2 percent. However, the reading recorded a decline from the gain of 0.9 percent in February to 0.6 percent in March.

Reading the lines from top to bottom, starting from higher levels. 

1.The 0.6456 line held in resistance since mid-March. 

2.The 0.6380 line is next and until this past mid-March, it has held in support since 2009.

3.The 0.6240 line is next while the 0.6150 line is seen as the immediate support level.

4.The 0.6000 line, being a round number is next and has psychological significance. 

5.The 0.5920 line is offered some breathing room after the strong gains experienced by the AUD/USD currency pair last week.

6.The 0.5800 line marks the final support level for now",3,,,

Really sorry if my question is really stupid. I am just a novice, trying to understand the forex market. 

The above results is in GBPUSD if that matters to anyone.",2,"As someone who's spend hundreds of hours backtesting, yes.
Backtesting can:
- Help you see if you actually have an edge. Markets may be seasonal, but if you have a positive expectancy over a number of years then chances are you'll remain positive.
- Help you see what your max draw down would have been up until now. Which is very useful for your money management strategy.
- Help with trading psychology. If you're prepared for 10 losers in a row then you're less likely to give up on the strat during a drawdown or bad period.
- Last but certainly not least. Chart time! Spending hundreds of hours analysing charts will help you easily spot when your edge is setting up. But not only that, you'll subconsciously see other patterns forming in the markets which will massively help your trading.

There's probably many more reasons but these are a few I could think of 5 minutes after waking up. ","As for me, backtesting is one of the most important things in trading. First of all, it helps to reduce time spent on testing. Demo testing of each new idea would take weeks, while backtesting allows to do the same ina minute. Another point is that manual testing would be influenced by the psychological issues,   and backtesting allows to see the profitability of the strategy itself. Among other tools for backtesting the most comfotable for me is Forex Tester as all necessary features plus user-friendly interface.   


@welshboy14 Great idea about psychological preparation!",Depends on what you are backtesting. Chart time to improve intuition or curve fitting (combining a few variables to make a strategy)? Most people are doing the latter.

Economic indicators,Forex,What Economic Indicators or News do you look for when doing Fundamental Analysis,"I am a complete beginner when it comes to Forex

&#x200B;

So my questions are, does Technical Analysis already price in the Fundamentals of a currency? For example, would a strategy based on TA break because of news release? Do you follow news by Central banks, look at GDP and CPI? What news or macroeconomic numbers do you look for during trading or is that irrelevant when you're trading on a short time frame like the 15m or 5m chart?",1,"Guys, do not shoot me up here, this is just my experience.

No, technical analysis (TA) has not already priced in the fundamentals (FA). TA simply shows the results of FA and what happened. TA cannot predict what FA will do next. It can only show what it has done, not what it will do because an institutional trader could not care less about support this or stochastic that. Price is being moved for reasons at the economic, geopolitical and yes, central bank level. TA cant predict any of that. Here is a Wiki that will explain your exact question and show why it is not true: [https://volatility.red/Fundamental\_Analysis#Objection\_#\_3:\_All\_News\_is\_Priced\_into\_the\_Markets](https://volatility.red/Fundamental_Analysis#Objection_#_3:_All_News_is_Priced_into_the_Markets) 

Your second question, YES, TA will absolutely break because of a news release. No question, happens almost everyday. Simply go to a forex calendar and look at the times of high impact data releases for whatever currency, then take a look if the TA held true. Doing the work for yourself will answer your questions.

Your third question, for me, absolutely I follow all those things (central banks, GDP, CPI, etc.) because that is what the masters of the forex trading universe follow and base their decisions on. People are RIDICULOUS to think that some chap with hundreds of billions of dollars at whatever big name bank or fund is going to be looking at stochastic, RSI, Ichimoku, triangle patterns or whatever other retail shmuck thing that is on offer. The only reason they would look at anything retail would be to see that there is a nice liquidity trap that they can use to help fill their large order. Other than those manipulations, they are basing all their trading decisions on fundamental or sentiment reasons.

That’s not a criticism, just an observation. Forex tends to have cycles of behaviour which last for significantly shorter periods of time - up to three years is the usual estimate.

1. In stocks / equities in the US, market is open for 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week. Forex trades 24/5. 

2. Stocks / equities always always always have a long bias in high time frames (think of a chart that shows 2+ years). This is because stocks are widely used as investments. This can both create and destroy edge. Forex pairs trade in ranges, AUD/USD isn't going to magically double in 2 months like a stock might - forex is more stable / consistent. 

3. You can trade forex at night / in the morning / when you're not working a 9/5. You can't do that with stocks. 

4. Generally, forex trading is more profitable than trading stocks (though generally more risky). With forex, I can easily make 20% on a trade consistently (20% of position size) where as with stocks you'd be lucky to consistently make 1% or 2% on your positions on a consistent basis. Sure this changes with iptions but options have way more risk than forex. 

5. With forex, you don't have to get into company financials or any of that speculative nonsense. There are a limited number of quality currency pairs that everyone trades and they all move off the same economic data / signals in different ways.

US30 is by far my most profitable trading instrument, and I only watch a couple of fx pairs now (GBPJPY for example.)

It's the only business in the world where you can make 100%, pure profit, and NOT have to factor in any other expense outside of taxes. 

Scaling potential, limitless. Opportunities, boundless. 1% on 100k is $1,000, or $10,000 on a $1,000,000 funded account. 

You never have to ""do"" more marketing, 'gain' more customers, hire more employees, or any potential issues that comes with scaling any other business. 

What works for a 100k, works the same for 1MIL. 

I love that I'm completely responsible for my success and failures. No inside job to derail me. No office politics. No ""climbing the corporate ladder"" for executive positions. 

And, no competition. No competing for market share. Me making $1k today won't affect you earning the same, or greater. There's enough room for EVERYONE to play. 

Working out a repeatable system that pulls money out the market is the challenge. 

Because it's so easy and accessible for everyone to get into, that's what makes it so hard.

Stock market,options,I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ng4vmop1g5771.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec5b766b99d8ad4fdca8f55d229f087bf4c2d8b)

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. Identifying a crash itself is very hard

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6itqq273g5771.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec154f4892c6522d84357d7358fbeaa99c835b2)

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.   

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

First of all, congrats on going to an HS that had a personal finance class. That's extremely rare despite the desperate need to address financial illiteracy. I participated in a similar contest in HS, but it was in my *science* class, because my science teacher happened to be a resource simulations nerd, like Civilization and Age of Empires video games.

In any case, contests like that are very common teaching practice that, IMO, is an excellent way to teach the wrong financial lessons, as it gamifies risk-taking. Students who were never exposed to those kinds of contests will have fewer bad habits to unlearn.

> There was no penalty for losing all your money

:smh: :facepalm:

> Assuming that you start with $1k and that with normal stock trading nobody would end with >$1250 (25% gain), what options play would you make to give you the best chance of ending over $1250?

Find a loophole in the rules and exploit it (like a hedge fund might), or commit outright fraud (like FTX). If we're going to teach bad financial habits to teens, we might as well go all the way. Why stop at half measures?

For example, in my class, I found a loophole in the way the teacher was simulating bonds and resource management. Students started with random resources, random widgets to build that required resources they might not have, and cash. You could also trade sim stocks or sim bonds. I realized that the rate of return on the bonds was enough to beat any of the other investments or revenue from selling widgets in just one week (bonds matured daily and I could reinvest total proceeds daily, so the magic of compounding), so I went to every student that needed the resources I had and swapped them for cash, then YOLO'd all that cash into bonds. I won by a huge margin with almost zero risk and producing zero widgets (GDP was zero). Just like a hedge fund!","Put it all on slightly otm weeklies on whatever volatile stock you want. The goal of this exercise is to increase variance, even if the teacher doesn't realize it.

For example, if you can bet it all on an even odds coin flip, you approach winning the game half the time. In a class of 30 that's fantastic. As other smart people realize this is the game you have to put in all on worse odds with a higher payout. The more people in the competition, the higher variance you want.","We had the same, except we waited for a month. I 11x my money, ngl I was pretty proud

The overall hypothesis is that Mars influences human behavior in a very negative way, not just on investors, but people in general. I have been demonstrating how that same Mars/lunar node alignment also affects military conflict. There is a near identical planetary alignment between Mars and the lunar node during the significant terror attacks and stock market crashes.

The book ""The Mars Hypothesis"" by Anthony of Boston uses this thesis to present the idea that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars. In this book, data going back to 1896 shows that as of April 2020, percentage-wise, the Dow Jones rose 857%. When Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node since 1896, the Dow rose 136%. When Mars was not within 30 degrees of the lunar node, the Dow rose 721%. Mars retrograde phases during the time Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as Mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node. The purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the Federal Reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet Mars, but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time, formulate a system that would enable the Federal Reserve to carry out its application in real time. Using the observation of the planet Mars, the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation, interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year 2098.",1,,,

**Data**

Reddit’s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20.

The summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).

**Analysis**

Ahh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.

So what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \[2\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.

Considering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a. One Week

b. One Month

c. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)

The benchmark for comparison is SPY\[3\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.

Before we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**

We would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \[4\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[5\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays).

So, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?

Would you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.

But keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ye4hbj8pdbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=90e5171c0279ba9428d889dd46d8a0bbab33da15)

GME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \[6\].

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.

https://preview.redd.it/faw73z8qdbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e01686c9740202b0a86f0c7e7bbd0a9d4d193d8

Unsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3tu6gfqrdbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3923e9917d26c772af234ce7c31a32882a2ca5)

For every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.

But what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?

https://preview.redd.it/n95yi6lsdbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f795b4404f8277bad99a57624f158a6a0594d7b0

Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \[7\].

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it’s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.
* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.
* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works — stay tuned!

**Conclusion**

Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with

>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!

I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***

Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).

Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.

\[2\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.

\[3\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.

\[4\] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.

\[5\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

\[6\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns is [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).

\[7\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*",1140,"> Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter 

No, it's not either. That's the answer. Same with stocktwits. Chatter rises with a stock's movement. 

WSB isn't useless tho, there have been scientific papers/reports written that show that DD on the sub does predict stocks going up. But the quality of DD rapidly declined after the GME thing.","The overperformance makes sense to me due to the fact that these tickers become popular when they move a ton.  DFVs original post on GME was buried, it wasn't until the stock started rocketing that the ticker chatter blew up.  A lot of WSBers don't pay attention to the actual DD there and just buy the top and sell the bottom.  I'm on the retroactive prophecy side.  

That being said, really cool study and it is interesting that youd beat the market if you were to follow the plays there early enough.","there are kids in there who have no idea what they are getting into and losing boat load of money....rarely you ll see couple of people posting massive gains but most are losing big time. have seen guys asking, how to sell options after throwing like 10k on OTMs."
Stock market,options,The deep down analysis of macroeconomics indicators in fueling the bull run in the stock market,"Hey guys, i know lot of you guys are really confused up the huge rally in the indexes this half of the year, and most you should be thinking of AI boom is the reason, or the markets are irrational and it would be irrational for long time so i should buy SPY calls .But, folks i want you to look at the current macroeconomic indicators of the country and guess the answer of the rally.



1.GDP- In the last quarter we saw the GDP increased by 2.6% and the market was so bearish to the fact that fed is tightening the rates and the expectations for the GDP growth of this quarter was 1.6% which turned to be very wrong as country’s GDP went to 2% in this quarter which was a good signal 



2.Unemployment rate and non farm payrolls- the unemployment rate was 3.7% which  is upstick from the last month but still remains one the country’s all time low unemployment rate and the monthly non farm payrolls surged to 339k from the expectancy 190k which is a good signal that the US economy is resilient 



3.Inflation- the inflation rate is 4% which is lower than the expectation of 4.1% and this is relatively lower inflation as we saw one of the great inflation of 9% earlier last year and the but still we will see 2 more hikes as the target of inflation is 2% , interest rates are high to 5.25% but still companies profits are telling us that economy is still doing good


4.Consumer spending growth- the consumer spending is one of the main reason instead of the high inflation saw these months but still the consumer spending surged from forecasted 1.4% to a great number of 4.2% which shows you all money flowing in the economy 


5.exports- exports seems pretty tough though because the reason of the crude oil in the global markets


I am just here to make some points about the current state of the economy and how it is affecting our markets but i am sure this bull market going to remain some time because of the current toughness of markets please give me any information you find suitable in your comments and I’ll share my investment statergies in next post by the help of economic indicators",7,"post hoc, ergo propter hoc.

Trading strategy,options,My most profitable options trading strategy: 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condors,"In April I started trading the 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condor strategy. This has so far been my profitable strategy.

Since a new year has started, I have summed up my results from this strategy after 112 trading days and 588 individual trades.

Using an average buying power of up to 12.000 - 15.000 dollars I have made 9052 dollars on this strategy during these nine months.  For me that is a fantastic return, at least compared to other strategies I have tried. It is also less stressful than other 0DTE strategies as you rarely experience days with big losses.

Here is the essence of the strategy:

I sell Iron Condors on SPX with the delta on the shorts between 5 and 15. The distance to the longs are from 15 to 30 points on SPX.  I try to collect the same premium on both sides.

Immediately afterward I enter stop losses for each side for just a little more than the total premium collected for the Iron Condor.  Since usually only the stop loss on one side is hit, this means that the losses are kept at a minimum, hence the name ""Breakeven"".

The tight stop loss of course leads to more losses. Of my 588 trades 59 % have been losers and 41 % have been winners. But since the average winner is 2,45 times larger than the average loser, the strategy has a positive expectancy.

There are of course risks - the biggest being double stop losses. That happened in 3 % of my trades so far. Another risk, as with any 0DTE strategy, is bad stop loss fills.

From my perspective, the most positive with the strategy is that losses are kept so small. But to achieve this, stop losses are an absolute must.

If you are interested in learning more, I have done a detailed write-up of how I trade 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condors on my web page.

[https://www.sandvand.net/2022/01/02/0dte-breakeven-iron-condor/](https://www.sandvand.net/2022/01/02/0dte-breakeven-iron-condor/)",670,0dte gang wins and wins. Glad you’re finding success with it.,"If you search for ""0 dte Tammy Chambless"" you will find a YouTube video and links to a presentation she does that goes into a great deal of detail on strike selection and stop loss selection.  It includes some backtesting showing which have the greatest expected value.

*EDIT: Corrected spelling of last name.","This strategy is the definition of picking up pennies in front of the steamroller. Stop losses are CRUCIAL.

I ran this for a long time with an extremely high win rate but all it took was one crazy close that pumped like 50 points to wipe out months of gains."
Trading strategy,options,Painfully simple trading strategies that you had success with,"What’s the simplest trading strategy you used that in hindsight was either really dumb or just lucky that worked for any prolonged period of time? 

Mine was jumping on the ripper 5 mins out of the gate on any of the FAANG or big tech names during the spring last year. Somehow this worked for like 4 straight months at a pretty decent rate and I grew my account by almost 150%. I’d check futures, see if we were up or down going into the open, look at how the foreign markets closed out, look at the big names and see if anything had gapped, and hone in on the largest overnight movers in that tech or large cap sphere. Using Robinhood charts and really zero technical analysis aside from a pretty elementary understand of candlesticks, I’d read just half of the first 10m candle, and if it pushed hard (which everything does right at open) I would jump in at the cheapest OTM contract that fit my normal position size. Would normally get a continuation up until like 945, a slight pull back, then continue up until the real reversal sometime around 1015-1020. I’d usually punch out right at the first sign of reversal around 1015, which meant the first long wick candle I saw I’d bail out. Ended up leaving a lot of meat on the bone on multiple occasions and I’d check back around noon to see the contract up like another 30-40%, but the goal was to lock in profit in a short time and get back to the day job. 

Kind of comical how well it worked and how much beginners luck it was, but then again expectations were basically zero so the whole mental side of it never got in the way. Kind of fascinating to think about that too and how my own ignorance was a blessing to that style. I’ve tried to go back and do it a few times seeing if I can reignite that but I honestly get in my own way with it. I now “know” too much (or think I do, which I clearly do not) and either get spooked in one way or just get overwhelmed with all the different info and make the wrong choice. 

Either way, would love to hear some other stupidly simple strategies that worked at some point.",836,"Buy super cheap way OTM Microsoft options, like 60 days out, wait until the price went up, then drop them. I was averaging 10% a month when I first started with options with that.

Then I discovered debit spreads and it all went to hell",Sell covered calls. Theta gang sends their regards.,"Here's one that I had similar success with. I still use it sometimes. I would find a stock that was hot with day traders atm. I would wait untill Friday near close (most day traders dont hold over the weekend). I would buy the stock, then sell again Monday around 10 when they were peaking again. This is a stock strategy, not an options strategy,  but its simple. Purely market mechanics. No technical, no dd. Buy Friday, sell Monday.
Edit: don't let the cat out of the bag though guys or we'll have to start buying Monday and selling Friday"
Trading strategy,options,This has been my most profitable 0DTE options trading strategy,"For 16 months the 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condor has been my most profitable options strategy. In fact only one month (January 2022) ended with a loss.

Many have asked how the strategy did in the turbulent first half of 2022, so I decided to do a new write-up. You find the article here: [https://www.sandvand.net/2022/08/21/learnings-from-0dte-breakeven-iron-condor/](https://www.sandvand.net/2022/08/21/learnings-from-0dte-breakeven-iron-condor/)

The strategy is quite simple: I sell Iron Condors on SPX at 5 - 10 delta at different times of the day.  I set separate stop losses on each of the two spreads equal to the total premium of the IC (typically I add 10 dollars on top of that). Usually I let the Iron Condors expire, but I will also sometimes close them early to lock in some profit. 

This is a very tight stop loss compared to what most people do, and yes it will lead to more losses. Yet, the strategy as such has proven profitable.

Here is the summary after trading this strategy from April 20221 until today:

* I have done 1344 trades (usually I do 5-7 trades per day)
* The win rate has been 38,3 %, and the loss rate 61,7 %. This has stayed very consistent during this period.
* All trades are with one contract only - and I will never commit more than 15.000 USD in buying power, which means that I will have a maximum of 5 trades on simultaneously (but usually less)
* I have made 16.814 dollars on the strategy so far. For the one-year period of August 2021 to July 2022 I made 12.681, which is 84,5 % of my max buying power committed to the strategy.
* The average win (99 dollars) is 2,4 times as high as the average loss (41 dollars) - hence the positive expectancy despite most trades being losses.
* The biggest risk to the strategy is double stop losses. This has happened in 3,8 % of my trades. This percentage has stayed quite consistent as well during the whole period.

This is not the only 0DTE strategy I do on SPX. But I like that I rarely have days with big losses. It fits my trading style and risk willingness. 

Hope you find it interesting.",419,"I was shocked at the low win rate and high profit. I guess I don't understand how you are managing the stops. What I thought you meant is each wing stops at the full credit of the entire IC **plus $10**. So if max expiration profit of the IC is $100, you stop either wing at a loss of $110 or less. Which means the most the surviving wing can make is $50. Do you count that as a win or a loss? I don't see how such a strategy produces those average gain/loss numbers with that win rate, so I must be misunderstanding something.",What platform are you using?,"There are many people using SPY/SPX options as ""warranty against a big market swing"", then on the other side are traders who have statistically slight profit for selling such ""warranty"" to these people. But they have to develop and polish a strategy minimizing a risk of total wipeout in case of black swan event, where even automatic stop loss orders would fail."
Trading strategy,options,Most leveraged option trading strategy for a strategy,"Hi folks,

I have developed a long strategy with 70% win rate. The strategy is aimed for being a profit/loss in 3 weeks.The price traget is like 10 usd above from current price.

Ex.If spot price of NVDA is 450USD my strategy predicts with 70% accuracy if price of NVDA will reach 460 USD over the next 3 weeks timeframe.

The challenge with this strategy is that we dont know when NVDA  would reach that price target in the 3 week timeframe i.e NVDA could reach PT hypothetically tomorrow or may be at the end of second week.I havent found a single strategy that could cover both these scenarios Ex. Short dated options provide maximum leverage if say NVDA reached the price traget in 1-2 day  but a calendar spread (3/4 weeks) could give good return if say the price reached the target in 3 weeks.I am not considering butterfly as it only gains value around option expiry and around the short strike levels.

My question is , could there be any strategy that could give like 100+% return for price target  being reached in a short time frame or price target being reached in a little longer time ex.2 weeks

NB.I have already played around with optionstrat and still could not find anything solid

Edit1.I may not have been clear when I say return I mean 100%return on risk.This is different from return on my opening cost

Edit2.The reason for 100% return is to have a positive expectancy for the strategy.Tjeoretivally even a 60% return would give me 12% return on average.However I need to aim higher to account for  market turmoils that could break all strategies

You either have inside information, and if you trade on it you are committing a crime, or you are just pure speculating.

No such thing as a guaranteed profit.","Assuming you’re talking long straddles here. How do you know that the stock will guaranteed move by a large margin? What do you do if it moves massively in after hours and then at morning open it’s neutral?

After earnings, volatility usually collapses which tanks down the options prices.","Until you get IV crushed. You should paper trade strategies first.

Trading strategy,options,Summary of Carter's Trading Strategy From TastyTrade Rising Star Interview,"Greetings, Traders.

Tom Sosnoff of TastyTrade [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNAZHFdkC14) a young trader named Carter in a live stream from Thu 1 Dec 2022. If you don't want to watch the interview, here's a summary of his strategy.

**Trader**

Carter Dobbelmann, a 20-year-old from San Jose, CA.

**Claim to Fame**

Turned $500 into $30,000 within 1.5 years.

**Affiliations:**

* He's on ""Hourglass Trader."" (Google it.)
* He has replied to comments on the TastyTrade video.

**Strategy**: Selling Volatility

* Exclusively trades options.
* Roughly follows what TastyTrade recommends.¹
* Initially, gambled with six significantly OTM *Long Calls* on TSLA, to go from $500 to $7,000 without knowing anything about the stock market, options, or trading and getting extremely lucky. Then, gambled $7,000 on AMZN calls and blew away $6,000 to drop down to $1,000. After learning a more reasonable way of trading, he looks for high-IV underlyings and:

1. Shorts puts for a credit;
2. Shorts call spreads for a credit; and
3. Shorts put spreads for a credit.

* Because he sells high volatility, he's always looking at IV rank.

**Tactics**

* Trades with the trend of the underlying using vertical spreads.
* Runs *Short Call Spreads* when a stock breaks down, and *Short Puts Spreads* when it rallies.
* If he sees evidence that an active play is reversing, he'll add the opposite spread type from what he initially did. If he shorted a call spread, he'd short a put spread. Or if he shorted a put spread, he'd short a call spread.

**Trade Parameters**

* Sets OTM striking prices, going a little above or below the *expected move*² based on ±1∙ σ and TA.
* Uses DTE = \[7, 30\] days (usually not more than 25 days) on individual companies.
* Uses DTE = \[20, 30\] on SPX.

**Underlyings**

* Is indifferent to the underlying.
* Says he plays indexes, e.g. SPX.
* Initially, he traded CLOV and AMC.
* He recently played SI and GME.

**Trading Activity**

* He places 10 to 15 trades per day.
* He maintains a portfolio of fifteen concurrent positions with many different underlyings.
* With a $30,000 account, he's likely risking $2,000 on each position.

**Profit-Taking**

* He exits whenever he captures 25% to 50% of the maximum theoretical profit, usually closer to the latter.
* Because he uses distributed expirations (e.g. DTE = 7, 14, 20 days), he takes profits virtually every day.

**Risk Management**

* If he ran a *Short Call Spread* and the underlying kept moving up, he'd roll the spread up and widen the striking prices.
* This implies that if he ran a *Short Put Spread* and the underlying keeps moving down, he'd roll the spread down and widen the striking prices.
* He doesn't hold beyond the point of capturing 50% of the maximal theoretical profit to try to minimize risk.
* He manages risk very actively and aggressively.

**Unknown or Unanswered Questions**

* How he builds a watchlist.
* What time(s) of day he typically enters/exits trades.
* Quantity of each trade type.
* Scaling strategy.
* Underlying selection criteria.
* DTE criteria.
* Trigger(s) to roll a trade.
* Trigger(s) to exit a trade.
* Spread width.
* Average number of distinct underlyings in his portfolio.
* Win rate.
* Average profit per trade.

**My Thoughts**

This gives us an outline of what he's doing, but the Devil is in the details, and a lot is missing. Without knowing what IV rank threshold (and other criteria) he's using for scanning for underlyings, the spread width, what decision-making criteria he uses to trigger a roll, etc., we just don't have enough information to be able to try to replicate this.

We also don't know anything about how he's making decisions about where the market is likely to go, overall. Trading during the week of Mon 5 Dec 2022 might be dangerous because more macroeconomic data is being released. On Tue 13 Dec, the CPI will be released. The following day, the Fed will announce its interest rate decision at 2:00 pm ET, followed half an hour later by The JPow's press conference. It would be imprudent to try to trade oblivious to these important macroeconomic catalysts.

This interview is interesting, but ultimately leaves us guessing. Without additional information and a comprehensive list of trades over a three-month period, so that we could look at the transaction times and replay the price action to understand the decision-making, I think that it's impossible to truly figure out what a trader is doing and whether it could have a sustainable edge. What would help the most is an Excel spreadsheet containing every trade's transaction time, action, and a justification for that action. It's impossible to reverse-engineer what we've heard in just the interview well enough to put it to the test.

We can reduce the unknowns by just focusing on SPX. If someone can track Carter down, it would be interesting to get him to fill in the blanks. We really need to understand how he minimizes losses from positions that go against him. To manage risk ""aggressively,"" what triggers him to roll a position, and how soon in the life cycle of a trade that's in trouble does he do this?

Artem",200,Time will tell. A few months is not a very long history. /Sample size.,"Thanks for the excellent summary.

If there are any newbies reading this threat and licking their lips, and hoping for similar returns, pls be very careful. 

I sense that for every 1 Carter, then must be 20 others who tried the same strategy but blew their account. But we never hear of them.

Carter basically sold credit spreads, and given his 6000% return in 1.5 years, he's obviously taking a ton of risk on each trade.

Going forward, he may find his returns are not so good, cos his account is now larger and his emotions will change when he's playing with much larger amounts on the line. Its easier to double $500 than it is to double $30k.","Bullshit story. Nobody turned $500 into $30,000 from ""selling volatility"". 

The story would have been believable if the kid had $50,000+ and turned it into more from selling options...but this story is so absurd that it can be dismissed outright.

The only people turning $500 into tens of thousands of dollars are degenerates like me who buy short dated options and ride gamma and vega to Valhalla.

I sell options too but selling options is the classic ""takes money to make money"" story and it's slow and steady. Selling options will never deliver outsized gains.

Great summary breakdown! I just hate bullshit artists with bullshit stories... especially when they aren't even believable to anyone except the most gullible or inexperienced.

Take TastyTrade with a heaping amount of salt too. They do stuff like this to sell their tastyworks platform and ""options selling is for everyone"" narrative."
Trading strategy,options,Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 12 - Monetizing the Level of Implied Volatility (Big Brain Trading Strategy),"# I've found huge edges by trading how the level of implied volatility changes. This post explains how. 

# Example: I sold some of the January straddles on RIVN when they released options this week at around 150% IV. It's now at 129%. 

[Bloomberg Terminal Screenshot for RIVN volatility yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/osvt3tdme6081.png?width=2118&format=png&auto=webp&s=5134b4a0be47b031421957363281f3b2b2a71516)

*I was able to capture* *21 Vegas in 1 day!*

This could have gone the other way, but a lot of work went into pricing the fair value of IV here (actually have it much lower than where it is now), and in this lesson I will go into how to think about trading implied volatility levels and price it out for yourself.

# Most traders only think about trading implied volatility VS realized volatility.

Or what we might refer to as ""theta gang"" strategies. But there is a whole world of opportunity out there to be explored by trading *how the actual implied volatility number* changes for options.

# This post will go in depth on how to trade the level of implied volatility and how the PnL for it works.

The reason I bring this up is that I have spent some time looking into mispriced options in longer dated options and I think there is lots of edge to be found there. But in order to take advantage of this, we need to understand how to price and trade the level of implied volatility.

**Note: these are advanced trades. There's good returns to be made. But it can be absolutely brutal if you are on the wrong side. Having a strong thesis and good position management are a must.**

# Its all about that vega, baby!

Trading is all about finding where you disagree with the market and then expressing your view on that disagreement correctly.

If we are going to be trading the level of implied volatility, we need to make sure we are *exposed* to change in the level of implied volatility.

Options off the bat are sensitive to this, through one of the greeks called vega. Vega is the change in the option price for a 1 point change in implied volatility.

For example, if *implied volatility went from 40% to 41%, vega tells us how that would impact the price of the option we are looking at*. If our vega was ""1000"" the position would change in value by $1,000.

# What options are most sensitive to vega?

The primary way to get a lot of vega exposure, is to go further out in time.

When go very far out in time, you have very little gamma, and therefore very little theta. the primary exposure is vega, which creates a somewhat linear trade.

# For example: here is the greeks for a Jan 2024 straddle on SPY:

&#x200B;

[Short JAN 2024 straddle. Look at our greeks!](https://preview.redd.it/61v0b3gpc6081.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2cd40e74f46407bf73c843c944cb095f2baf8ec)

As you can see, we have *very little sensitivity*  to delta, gamma, theta. But an unbelievably bigger sensitivity to vega! This is why we consider these to be ""linear"" trades for the most part: The PnL really moves up or down with changes in implied volatility. 

What about nearer dated options?  Let's take a look at a straddle on SPY that expires this week. 

&#x200B;

[Short SPY November 17 2021 Straddle. Looks different huh?](https://preview.redd.it/2lqybubad6081.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a3881978c9cdf335428bb38a542ce52f133f85)

When we reduce the time to expiration, vega is much less impactful. As you can see, when we are expiring soon, gamma and theta run the show primarily!

In either situation, if implied volatility goes up, you are going to make your vega , if implied volatility goes down, you are going to lose your vega . So when trying to monetize implied volatility dislocations, looking further out in time is a good idea.

# A slightly gruesome analogy to understand vega vs theta trading

Imagine a person who finds out that they have 1 day to live. They are going to expire in one day. What happens in that one day before expiry means a lot to them. If they have a bad day, it would be devastating, and good day would be euphoric.

It makes sense, they need to maximize on today. The outcome of this day is definitive of the quality of their life.

Now imagine another person who has 80 years left to live.

All of a sudden what happens today isn't such a big deal. There's lots of days left, so if today was mediocre.. it's not the end of the world. So what does this person focus on? Whats really important to how they feel and the trajectory of their life? *It's their outlook on their future and what they see for down the road.*

# Just like the person with 1 day to live, shorter dated options are really sensitive to things that happen today. A lot of theta, a lot of gamma.

On further dated options, just like the person with 80 years left to live, it's more so the outlook on the future that matters. If your option expires in 2 years, it's ok for the most part if the stock moves above it's average daily move today.  But if all of a sudden the future of the business goes from stable to uncertain, the value of your options will change drastically. The reason it will change drastically is because there's lots of vega, or exposure to a change implied volatility.

There is money to be made where the level of implied volatility is different than what we think it should be.

# Is there money to be made trading the longer dated options?

A lot of people think you cant make a lot of money trading longer dated options. So people will maybe buy leaps, and sell covered calls against them since the leap is not very sensitive to volatility. But as I hope you are starting to see, this can not be further from the truth!

**For example, let's take a look at a trade that was shared with me on ARKX.**

When it became option-able this year, a friend of mine shared some research on the longer dated options that was really interesting. The 1 year options were trading at 40% implied volatility, and our conclusion was that they were worth 25% implied volatility.  over the next couple months, it came all the way down. a 15 point drop in implied volatility.

&#x200B;

[IV literally got crushed.](https://preview.redd.it/09cwwd87i6081.png?width=2446&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb33e6c735acf2ad1cdfa7a255de69c76c116c6)

So the question is, how profitable was the trade?

Here is what the position looked like at inception. Take a look at our greeks. **As you can see..**

&#x200B;

[Sold for $4.825 \/ lot](https://preview.redd.it/4baz43woi6081.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b4e7534fa4c4f7cd05f61f727e22aa4ab9328c)

Here's what it looked like at the end.

&#x200B;

[Bought back for $2.99 \/ lot!](https://preview.redd.it/gz84yltti6081.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=57f26bfd75e2638941a600d8c635d8e9330d6b05)

# The options basically got cut in half!

Because of the nature of this trade and the confidence in the research, myself and the others I know in this position were able to scale up pretty big. 

&#x200B;

[this was in late June](https://preview.redd.it/i77akldbj6081.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ff5b27cd0f36ef74dba1ab2615f6ad7492108f9)

# What was really interesting is how wrong the market's pricing was.

As we go further out in time, there tends to be less liquidity on some of these names when you go further out. There's just less eyes on it. That means opportunity.

For example, on RIVN, myself and the others I was looking at this trade with basically made up all of the longer dated volume early on Tuesday. 

Because of how poorly it was being priced, and the thoroughness of the research we did, I was able to scale up on this position significantly. I've found that there's actually a lot of opportunity like ARKX that comes around. So now let's discuss a couple of basic ways to price these out and find these opportunities.

# Idea generation

Something that I've noticed is when realized volatility spikes in the near term, sometimes the whole term structure will elevate and the back can get really out of line.

So i typically look for these types of trades when bad news has come out around a stock, industry or sector.

**Examples of times that I have traded this way:**

* When Archegos blew up. Longer dated vols on the companies that were held by the fund stayed elevated post event.
* ARKX release. Options were pretty illiquid and very poorly priced. Anticipating a lot more volatility than it should have given the underlying stocks
* TSLA longer dated options were being priced at extremely high levels given the size of the company and relative to correlated assets
* KWEB pricing in extremely high volatility (higher than covid) because of Chinese market issues.
* RIVN starting to release options and pricing them at insane levels of implied volatility.

# How to price the level of implied volatility: DISCA example

In order to explain how to go about pricing the level of implied volatility, I am going to go through a trade that I took earlier this year on DISCA.

Keep in mind that this is the sentence we are trying to complete: ***The market is showing me that the stock is trading at an implied volatility of X, I think the level of implied Vol should be Y.***

# The Situation

Earlier this year when the Archegos fund blew up, the stocks that it was holding took a massive hit. Simply put, they got crushed! This lead to a massive opportunity, that was missed by much of the retail community. The options market went berserk. 

Before the fund blew up, the fair value for options were around 55-58% IV. 

But when everything exploded, the crazy movement in the short term caused the whole option chain to lift up!! All of a sudden, the 90 day and 120 day options were trading at 75%-80% IV!

For perspective, IV was at 68% during covid for the same DTE...

Basically, things look really crazy. So I set out to price the options and try to uncover a trade.

# There are two ways to price the options here. Absolute value and relative value. Let's go over each way for DISCA;

# 1) Example of absolute value pricing:

Absolute value pricing involves comparing what we are seeing today for a stock against what we have seen in the past. 

DISCA July options were trading at 55% IV before the Archegos liquidation. As the event happened, Implied volatility shot up to 75%. A couple days later, when the event was over, it was still at 70% IV. 

&#x200B;

[IV stayed elevated even when the event was over. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0alx7m5l6081.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=a356b0eab97e9f3de96f7ce3421bfc421c4d439d)

Thinking about how options are priced, it would make sense that the level of implied volatility came down here since the impact from the event had happened already (assuming there were no further ""chain reactions"") and therefore the level of implied Vol should come back down to what it was Pre-event, or 55%.

The reason I did't think there would be chain reactions is that the realized volatility basically stopped after the event. Check this out:

&#x200B;

[RV went right back to normal after the news!!](https://preview.redd.it/bmp8w036o6081.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=09a7d4c47e449b0eabace186348a14f398f1abf0)

# With a normal implied volatility of 55%, the event over, and RV returning to normal, it seemed reasonable to expect the IV to come back down to the 55% range.

# 2) Example of relative value pricing:

Relative value pricing is an extremely powerful way to price options. It involves comparing the options for a stock we are interested in against other stocks that are correlated. 

For example, KO and PEP are strongly correlated. They have similar levels of implied volatility. Take a look at this pic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b7c35gfcm6081.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b4f5b7a06d5a768201585756a8aaf07ac3b8c0

The above picture is showing : Blue - PEP 90 day IV. Green - KO 90 day IV. Bottom green - Ratio between KO and PEP 90 Day IV.

As you can see, they move together. when KO Vol goes up, so does PEP.

Looking at the ratio, you can see they have an average ratio between them that they mean revert around. This is because they have correlated movements and implied volatilities. When the spread between them gets too large, we see it close. 

Now imagine we saw this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3uiu5teom6081.png?width=2364&format=png&auto=webp&s=95ee9a4c2c05438f7e9691b8097ec0fd7add88bc

The red line is a hypothetical situation where the ratio between them shot up.

In this situation, we could also say that there is an opportunity to trade the level of implied volatility for these companies.

We could buy Vol on the lower iv one, sell Vol on the higher one. OR we could look for which leg is ""inefficient"" and likely to change the most, and just trade that one.

# So how did I use relative value pricing to trade DISCA? 

First, I went out to find a correlated stock. The one I settled on was FOXA. Then I plotted the IVs for each of them and looked at the ratio. 

&#x200B;

[DISCA iv30 \/ FOXA iv30](https://preview.redd.it/p55msy86n6081.png?width=2178&format=png&auto=webp&s=b12d46b411a0ae33660cc93d632b3c60eb846d58)

As you can see, at the time of the disaster, the IV went through the roof. Since FOXA was not a part of the disaster, It was clear that it wasn't really an industry impacting event, and that when the disaster is over, the volatility should return to something back in line with this correlation. 

# With an average ratio of about 1.1-1.2, and FOXA trading at around 45-50% IV. it seemed reasonable that we should see DISCA volatility come back to around 55% - 60% IV.

My analysis on DISCA painted a very clear picture of what should happen to the options after the event. Because I had done enough leg work to develop a good thesis, I was able to pack on some size and make a fantastic return. 

# Both my absolute value and relative value narrowed down on a similar fair value for implied volatility on DISCA, between 55% and 60%!

From here, I went and sold July straddles on DISCA and sure enough, the IV came down to my expected fair value and I was able to pay for a nice vacation :) 

I closed out this position when it was pretty much at my fair value. 

On the flip side, if this trade had gone against me, I would have to go back to the drawing board and really dig into my thesis. Holding these types of positions through IV spikes can be catastrophic if you are wrong, so a lot of work would have to go into *why* it's moving against me. 

On a couple other positions, it has moved against me in the short term but then I have been right in the end of the day. Weathering those storms is no joke though especially if you have a meaningful amount of money on the line. This is why I always stress the importance of knowing your stuff before scaling up your trades.

# Conclusion:

By knowing how to price the level of implied volatility, you can develop really strong ideas that can yield great returns. This has been one of my primary strategies this year, especially with the meme stock craze, tensions in China, etc. 

# IMPORTANT POINT:

This is NOT about just selling high IV. A lot of the times, IV is high for a reason. ***This is about pricing IV, and selling when it is expensive.***

A lot of traders make the mistake of selling because it's high, but I hope this post helps you think different about volatility and gives you some ideas about where you can find a real edge in the market. 

Remember, once you have an idea of where IV *should* be, you can make a trade if it's different than what the market is pricing.

**This post is a bit trickier than some of the others I have made and will make in the future, but don't let that discourage you.** 

Trading is a competition in the end of the day. It attracts very smart people to play, and there's no free lunch. I'll be around to answer questions, so please ask if you have any!

Previous parts of this series: [PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pxe1wj/the_ultimate_guide_to_selling_options/), [PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/py2j8g/ultimate_options_selling_guide_pt_2_detailed/), [PART 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/pzf40t/ultimate_guide_to_selling_options_profitable_part/). <- read these and it will hopefully lay some groundwork for this post.

# It all starts with Idea Generation

This is where I find a lot of people struggle, but it should actually be one of the easiest parts of strategy development. 

For you to have a profitable system, you just need to be better than the next guy. It doesn't need to be super fancy or complicated. 

Think about it like you are an electrician in your local town. Currently, there's some guy making all the money for fixes in the area. If you can find some sort of advantage, now you'll be the guy making all the money. Maybe you can get jobs done faster, maybe you sell better, maybe your price is lower. 

**Note**: an idea alone is worthless. Just like in business, ideas don't make money. Execution is what makes money. 

**Note**: Your idea can't be too general. It can't just be ""I want to sell options"". It needs to be more specific. With that being said, it doesn't need to be something super complex. 

At this point, we are just deciding. on something we want to investigate. 

**Examples of good things to explore:**

* Is the implied variance risk premium higher on ETFs than stocks?
* Where is the variance risk premium the highest across US equities?
* Is selling vol on tech stocks and buying vol on finance a good pairs trade?
* Can we forecast earnings straddle PnLs?

# A trading edge has distinct Characteristics:

Below is a list of different things that can lead to an edge in the market. I share these to spark some ideas so that you can think about where you should look for an edge given your unique situation.

&#x200B;

* **Data access**: do you have access to better data that no one else does. Example: Imagine the number of species in the Marianas Trench could predict tomorrows SPY price. Well, no one has that data. So if you did, you would have more knowledge than everyone else and you'd make the most money. 
* **Skillsets**: If you are competing in a very low capacity space where there is lots of individuals and not so many teams, having strong data science skills (pull in data, manipulate and transform the data)  could give you an edge and help you build your trading business. 
* **Your network**: Do you have access to people who can give you good ideas. Example: private equity deals , having a network of professional traders to collab with, etc. 
* **Specialization**. If you are a corporate lawyer, can you figure out M&A deals better than the next guy? If you work in small cap tech can you figure out software development cycles and product release dates better than the next guy? Are you a doctor who understands biotech better than the next guy?
* **Geography**: You can only trade certain products when you live in certain places. This also incorporates regulatory issues too. 
* **Being first to an idea**: I guess this is the ""reinventing the wheel"" point. This is a pretty competitive route to take but for example when new products are released, no body *really* knows how to price it efficiently so there is room for you to come in and take a stab at pricing it better than the next guy. 
* **Liquidity constraints**: Using your capital size to your advantage. Warren Buffett once said if he had a million dollars he could do 100% a year and that is because he could take the same ideas he uses and use them on lower cap stocks which are less efficiently priced. So where can we go that the big players can't? (Don't try to find food in the ocean, find a pond with lots of small fish). 
* **High Barrier to entry due to infrastructure:** We can't really just go and start a high frequency trading firm. The infrastructure for this is insane, so if you have it, you could have an edge. 
* **Risk tolerance**: Do we have a higher risk tolerance than the next guy, and can therefore take trades  with more PnL variance that others maybe avoid/ can't take. Example: A volatility hedge fund might not want to deploy a strategy with 5% daily swings, even if the expected value is huge. 

Those are some characteristics of a good edge/ idea and hopefully it gives you some ideas. 

**In another post, I will go into my strategy for earnings trading as a follow up example to this**. The reason I am exploring earnings is because there is a lot of retail interest, it's tricky to model well, and there's likely to be a variance risk premium. 

# Building your strategy

# 1) Pick what you are trying to predict/forecast. 

Something really important to note is that whenever you are placing a trade, it is your opinion VS the market. There is somebody on the other side of your trade taking on the opposite view of you. 

Since we are trading our ideas against the market, it means, we are expressing a *disagreement with the markets view on things.* So whether we know it or not, we have some sort of ""forecast or predicting"" on how things *should be priced.* Being conscious about what we are trying to predict is very important. 

For example, if we are trading earnings volatility, what we might be trying to predict is the straddle PnL, and if we can identify when they are cheap/expensive, we can build a strategy. 

What we are trying to predict is referred to as your **target variable.** 

# Not why, but whether.

Once we have an idea or something we want to forecast, we don't want to ask ""why does this exist"". We start by asking ""whether this exists"". 

So many retail traders fall into this trap. They say: ""This sounds like a good idea because of A, B, and C reasons, I'm going to trade it"". 

But we can't ask why it exists until we confirm whether it does. 

This part usually requires some pretty serious data science skills. A workaround for retail is to look at academic papers for ideas, or surround yourself with people who have the skills. 

A good place to research is: [https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/)

# What should we try to predict?

What we try to predict is important. Here's an example to illustrate: 

It's hard to predict the score between West Ham and Manchester United ( an OK team and an all-star team), but it's not so difficult to predict who the winner is likely to be. 

So for our trading, sometimes we don't need to be trying to forecast the *exact move.* We can start by just focusing on *the bias.*

So from a basic perspective, if we are trying to forecast whether a stock has an inflated risk premium in it's options (they are expensive), we can look at some data points that help us predict cheap/expensive, a fair value on volatility, and a reason for it, but then in our execution, we can be less married to our fair value target price and trade the cheap/expensive bias more consistently. 

# 2) Determine the factors that help us with our prediction

Imagine you are trying to predict the amount of horsepower that a car has. In your ""model"", the **target variable** would be Horsepower. But what can help us predict horsepower?

* whether the car is a v6 or v8?
* The colour of the car?
* rear, front or all wheel drive?
* number of doors?

Let's say we determine that the 5 points above are good indicators of a cars horsepower. These would then become our **predictor variables**. 

**You can think of predictor variables as the checklist of things we go over when trying to make a conclusion about our target variable.** 

Example: If a car has a V8 engine, red paint, rear wheel drive, and 2 doors, it's probably over 300HP. 

# Consulting the data

If you want to be able to do this on a professional level, you will need to develop your data science skills. Being able to work with and manipulate data is the equivalent of knowing how to type in the professional space. It's not an edge, but it's basically expected that you know it. 

In the retail space (most of us here), it's a nice to have and not a need to have. So yes, knowing it can be an advantage, but it's not a necessity. 

I will focus on how to do this with no coding background unless enough traders want to see the other part. 

# An example of trading a strategy being implemented

**Note**: A lot of you ask what tools I use. A lot of the base data points and scans that I rely on are from Predicting Alpha. I then use Think or Swim to stress and analyze positions. I execute trades in Interactive Brokers. 

The reason I use these platforms is they a) provide me with analytics tools that ease the burden of needing data science skills b) let me analyze my positions in depth before putting them on c) offer me the best commissions and execution on my trades.

For this strategy I am sharing in this example, I am trading the difference between the implied and realized volatilities for US Equities. Because of the variance risk premium, and increased retail interest I aim to build out a model that helps me identify overpriced options.

# Let's start by defining my Target and Predictor Variables.

1) **Target Variable**: Realized volatility over the next 30 days for a stock

2) **Predictor Variables:** Current realized volatility last 30 days, current implied volatility 30 day, current future forecast of volatility 30 day, Current IV30d/RV30d Spread.

Through my own research and things I've learned, the set of predictor variables I listed above are good at telling me about what realized volatility will look like over next 30 days.

For each of those factors, I am trying to determine if they are high or low relative to the historic metrics (except for the volatility forecast, which is something a bit different, basically a statistical forecast of the future). 

Beyond each of these factors, I will look at the news to add a more qualitative component to my analysis. I want to understand *why* I am seeing what I do. 

# 1) Start with a scan

I started by running a scan for a stock that had some liquidity and an IV30 > Forecast by at least 1.2x. I also added a filter for IV30>45% to get rid of stocks that weren't implying much to happen.

The reason I do this is that the market has way too many things to look at, and it's efficient to use a scanner to filter from 1,000s of equities down to a shortlist of things that meet a ""base criteria"" for your strategy. 

[Filters: stocks price \> 15, average daily option volume \> 3000, IVvsFV \< 1.2x , IV30 \> 45, sorted by IVvsFV.](https://preview.redd.it/g6yp1atzenr71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcfd6b352cb0f410545e016a1c20ad197f5b3f5e)

&#x200B;

By doing so, I generated a list of 16 stocks to look at. Given the time of year, most of these stocks have earnings around 30 days from now, so I had to be careful to avoid ones with big earnings moves priced in since I am really trying to trade the non event volatility. Most of these stocks have a *bit* of earnings vol priced in on the 30dte options.

The stock I chose for this analysis is GRPN (Groupon). 

# 2) Evaluate your predictor Variables

IV30, RV30, and Forecast 30 analysis:

IV30 = 77%

RV30 = 48%

FV30 = 57%

IV30 is over 1.2x FV30. **This is my expensive indicator for the FV30 predictor variable.**

Off the bat, this is looking good. IV much higher than RV and Forecast. This is usually a strong sign for ""sell options"".

To move on, let's plot the historic IV30 and RV30 to see how they are moving relative to each other. 

[historical plot of IV30 and V30, we can see that IV has outpaced RV for the last month](https://preview.redd.it/adfkh4b8fnr71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9900fa2e0710a3eb126cc6233bcebe2658bc2309)

If we plot the historic IV30 and RV30, we can see that for the last while there has been a consistent premium of IV over RV. **This is my expensive indicator for IV30 and RV30**

**One cause for concern:** We can see that IV has continued to rise despite the lower realized volatility, which means that someone is still a buyer at these levels and could be a slight cause for concern. I would definitely want to do somme digging into the company to see what's happening around it and try to hypothesize about who could be buying here. 

One last point we will look at here is if this ratio between IV and RV is normal or if its at an extreme. 

As I described in a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/py2j8g/ultimate_options_selling_guide_pt_2_detailed/): *Think of IV and RV as being in a dance together. They take turns leading the dance, but they try to stay in step with each other.*

So looking at how they move together, we usually see it **mean reverts** around a comfortable spread between the two. If one strays too far from the other, they move closer together. If they move too close together, they push further apart.

# Here is the IV / RV ratio for GRPN over the last year.

[You can see it's move up towards the top of the range. This is because IV has been increasing while RV has stayed relatively low.](https://preview.redd.it/np8fipecfnr71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e72d5049240fdfb88dd32859dba102500d770fa)

As we can see, the IV/RV spread is towards the top of the range. meaning they are far apart right now. So we can expect either RV to pick up, or IV to come down, or them to meet in the middle (there's other combinations of possibilities, but let's keep it simple).

If we look back at the first graph, we see that RV has remained the same while IV has been moving up. So.. I could conclude that perhaps it will meet somewhere in the middle (iv comes down a bit, rv goes up a bit, but below the current IV line!). **This is my expensive indicator for iv/rv ratio predictor variable.**

# If we look at all the variables, they check the boxes for the realized volatility to be lower than the implied. AKA: IV is expensive. 

Now as mentioned there's some qualitative research into the news, sentiment, who's trading this, to really build some qualitative confidence too. But assuming that checks out, I would be selling options here!

# From here, I would put on a trade that properly express my view that volatility is expensive (maybe a straddle). 

I will go more in depth on structuring and managing trades in a later post, it's a whole topic on it's own.

# These are the basics of good strategy development and finding an edge in trading. 

I hope that this post has given you some ideas and insights into the world of profitable trading. It might seem like over kill, but I promise that I do not go out of my way to to make things complicated. We actually want things to be as simple as can be, while still being profitable. 

An important thing to note is that you can actually do all of this work and still lose money trading. It's a tough game. We need to always be improving, looking for new ideas.. always on the hunt for that better edge. 

# If you found this post valuable please upvote it as that gives me ideas about what I should write about in my next post. 

Happy Trading everyone.

\~AG",553,Haven't read your post yet but honestly thank you for these post I will read later,"Am finding that my edge is:

1. Having patient capital. No itch to buy or sell until the right opp comes along
2. Long term horizon. I can hold 5-10 yrs easy.
3. Never borrow on margin. I can stomach correction w zero pressure to sell.","I think you're missing one thing in your list of categories for an edge, which is industry knowledge.  I'm extremely tech-heavy in my portfolio and have been for years, however I've made some huge gains by getting in to companies early on because I work in tech so I know it better than most people.  I know why AWS is winning in the cloud space because I use it every day.  I can usually tell if a tech company is going to be successful long-term based on their products too.  For example, I saw a demo of DDOG's product at a conference before they even went public and I could tell instantly that this thing was pure gold since it could answer questions that I've struggled with solving for the previous 10 years of my career and was even capable of doing something in the Security field (not their intended purpose) that I had only theorized was possible but I knew would be invaluable once everyone else realized this (I pointed it out to the guy doing the demo as well and the use case had never even occurred to him).  I know what brands of CPUs my peers at other similar companies are buying for their high-performance computing clusters and why, plus the drives, networking gizmos, etc, and there's a reason that I'm jacked almost to the tits about AMD going forward along with a few other companies.  Finally, if Hashicorp ever goes public I will YOLO that shit so hard that even WSB will be impressed because their products are some of the best that I've ever used and I think almost everyone in the industry would probably agree with me.  


Now some of this probably falls under ""network"" as you mentioned, since I certainly leverage the opinions of my peers in tech when making some of these decisions.  However, trading companies in an industry that you intimately understand is definitely an edge and has served me well for a very long time.  Sure, there are big firms out there that will do their DD and have quants with decades of experience to actually do it, but even then the quants are going to ask people like me about a company's products and I can guarantee that one of their quants wouldn't be able to look at DDOG and have their eyes light up during their demo because they can finally give me a solution that I've wished I had for the previous 10 years.  I realize that I'm also glossing over things like revenue and how a company is run overall here, and in reality I can still take those things into account to a certain extent.  It's not too hard to look at a smaller tech company and determine if they're going to crash and burn because they can't run a company.  I can't tell if they'll succeed in general, but I can definitely tell if they won't based on how they run their dev process (this seems like it would be difficult to determine but in reality I've found that I can usually make a pretty good guess and I've never been wrong before) so I think that along with the usefulness of their offerings is enough to make a pretty good case in terms of fundamentals."
Trading strategy,options,Seeking Advice on Advanced Trading Strategies,"

Hello Reddit Traders,

I'm reaching out to the community today in search of advice and recommendations on advanced trading strategies. I've been involved in the stock market for three years, but my journey has been quite turbulent, and I'm ready to start anew.

I've explored various strategies like the ICT method, Elliott Wave theory, Fibonacci retracements, and supply and demand zones. However, I've had difficulty finding comprehensive YouTube courses that provide in-depth knowledge about these methods.

My ultimate goal is to build a solid long-term portfolio using options while engaging in day trading to generate additional income. I aspire to achieve consistent profitability, potentially as an option seller, with the aim of supporting my family.

I'm looking for guidance from experienced traders who can suggest trading strategies, educational resources, or any valuable tips that could aid me on my journey. Your insights would be highly appreciated, as I'm committed to putting in the time and effort needed to become a successful trader.

Options trading,options,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

[https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU](https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU) 

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

Options trading,options,3 Step Process To Options Trading,"I have been trading options for over 30 years and I am frequently asked, ""Where Can I Learn To Trade Options?"" Here is my 3 step process. Most of you are already mastering the first two steps and if you are proficient at those, the options part is pretty easy.

All of your trading has to start with market analysis. That means getting your bearings from a technical perspective (moving averages, volume, trendlines, momentum) and also be aware of the fundamental backdrop (earnings, interest rates, economic data, political policies). I spend 3 hours each morning conducting market analysis. This is the most critical step and it is the biggest piece of the puzzle. More than 75% of all stocks follow the market. If you get this wrong there is a 75% likelihood you will lose money. I always have a 5 minute chart of the SPY up when I am trading and I never take my eye off of it. Once you have your market bearings, you are ready for the next step.

Let's say that you have concluded that the market is bullish for the next few days and that the uptrend should continue. There are not any speedbumps (economic events) ahead and the downside risk is minimal. Now it is time to zero in on the best stock.

I look for stocks that are moving higher when the market is moving lower. I call this relative strength (RS). Do NOT confuse this with the RSI indicator that compares the stock's current move to its recent price movement (I find little value in RSI). Find stocks with relative strength that are moving higher on heavy volume and that have broken through technical resistance. These will be your best prospects.

If you get the market right and the stock right, options are easy. They are simply a way for you to increase your leverage. Here's the rub. I am not saying that getting the first two steps is easy. It is very difficult and until you hone your skills with steps one and steps two you should not trade options. You will simply lose your money faster.

Basic options buying strategies and vertical spreads are all you need to trade any market scenario. Your opinion of the market and your confidence in that forecast determine the best options trading strategy along with your opinion of the magnitude and the duration of the expected stock move. Keep your strategies basic and the positions will be much easier to manage.

Options are not the starting point, they are the icing on the cake. Market first, stock second and options last.

I went through the entire process and it culminated with a trade example. Here is a link to Part 2

Thanks in advance!",60,"Every gimme has a gotcha. 


You can try to learn about the Greeks and how they work.   But at the end of the day the options Greeks come out of the options price… they don’t determine the options price, the market (buyers and sellers) is what ultimately determines the price…. Black scholes is just a model that describes how the price of options should be based on normal distribution…..  remember it’s just a fancy model that is used to help describe the physics of how an options price moves… the mode is a good predictor but it isn’t the rule of law. 



if you’re going to go down the path of Greeks, learn Delta, theta, gamma, and vega…. There are more Greeks but those 4 will cover what you need to know…. 


Delta - you can think of this as the chance that the stock will end at that price. It’s also the amount the  options value will move based on a 1$ move in the stock…. So say you buy a 110 call on a stock that’s 90$ and it has a 20 delta… and the stock moves to 91$, expect yourself to gain 20 cents not 1$ on your call option.   Note: closer to expiration, the delta starts to collapse, meaning a 20 delta is a lot closer to the stock price at 0DTE than at 45 dte. 

Gamma- it’s a derivative on delta, it says how much delta changes with a 1$ move in the stock… so did the example above of the delta was 20 and the gamma was 2 then a 1$ move would make the delta now change to 22.   Note: closer to expiration gamma starts to grow exponentially

Theta: this is the time component of options. The options will theoretically lose theta amount of value every day.    As you get closer to expiration the theta on options starts to grow exponentially. 

Vega:   Kinda hard to explain this one but it’s essentially how the options price changes according to the volatility of the market (for the stock)   If Vega is high (you’d have to look at iv rank or iv percentile to get a better picture of this) then the options price will be high…. Think GME or AMC when they were mooning, the options Vega would explode so the options prices would skyrocket. 





Now all that knowledge isn’t going to help you trade. My advice is sell puts on something like SLV maybe 25 delta, something like 45 days out and then  close the position at 21 days. Rinse and repeat….   Do that for a year and since slv is relatively safe you won’t lose money, but you’ll learn how options prices get impacted by price movements or by time…. If slv is too slow for you pick a stock that’s under 30$/share but more than 15$/share and do the same thing.","*I’m not really interested in someone starting with $15-20k or more making money but the guys/gals with small accounts....*

$20k IS a small account in options terms.

 
*I've seen a lot of “I used to trade stocks and now I make hundreds of thousands with options” I understand half that is guys marketing their courses.*

No guy that makes hundreds of thousands produces YT videos promoting his strategy for $xyz/month.



*I don’t expect myself to make millions but just want some realistic expectations*

You WONT make millions. 

Newbies are sadly sold this dream by YT marketeers that options is a gateway to fast and easy riches. Dont believe the nonsense you see like ""I made $4,000 in two hours! Now I want to teach YOU how to do it.""
Think of options trading like doing an engineering degree for 4 years. At the end, you are not an engineer, but you have the basics of becoming one. Then it takes another 5 years of real world application before you become an engineer. Same with options.

Dont believe me? Try it. With real money.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the development of Tesla during the past three years, from 2019 to 2022. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration. In addition, a comparison to its main competitors and the market situation is also made. All is made to determine the fair value of the stock price and determine the investment strategy. All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company fairly valued by the market by its fundamentals?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

**Delimitations and Assumptions**

This thesis is delimited to an analysis of TSLA between the years 2019 and 2022. The thesis is based on the assumption that TSLA is the one of the most trending automotive company in the world, and that the prestige it has will support its price action in the next months.

**Methodology**

In this thesis, data from its financial statements are taken from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance and other publicly available information on the company on-line. The Company valuation is made based on:

* Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula
* Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model
* Discounted Cash Flow Model

**Hypothesis**

* US next interest rates hike of 25-50bps
* Inflation of 6.5% and cooling down to 6% for January 2023
* TSLA is high volume stock
* TSLA is overvalued
* There are many TSLA bagholders
* TSLA can’t outproduce its competitors in the near nor mid term

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Methodology

The thesis used macroeconomics data from the 13th of January 2023 for its valuations, Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Cash Flow are considered and projected to the next three years. The final price tag is obtained by the average of three valuation methodology: Graham Formula, Discounted Cash Flow and Cash Flow Evaluation. It is then given a 20% margin of error in both direction.

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, three methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

# Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 24.40%** is determined by the average analysts consensus for the company’s next year growth rate.

# Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company last year’s available cash flow data, its WACC based discount rate of 12,84% and its Growth Rate of 24,40% to determine a fair value of **$78.88** per share.

# Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing. This thesis uses the adjusted formula to better adjust it to the current market environment.

Data used for the calculation:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|EPS|3.24|
|Growth Rate|24.40|
|AAA Bond Yield|4.40|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$101.74**

# Discounted Cash Flow Model

This thesis uses Free Cash Flow, gained by subtraction Capex from Cash floe From Operations. Free cash flow (FCF) is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|WACC based discount rate|12.84%|
|Growth rate|24.40%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|Average Shares outstanding|3,157,752,000|

Which projected a FCF for the next five years as per follow:

Note: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is highly improbable due to unknown future events and variations in the market. This shall be taken only as an indicative forecast.

The calculation gives us a Fair Value of **$70.99** per share

&#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$78,88|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$101.74|
|Discounted Free Cash Flow Model|$70.99|
|**Final Price + 20% error margin**|**$104.83**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$83.87**|
|**Final Price - 20% error margin**|**$62.90**|

We can observe a 40% increase of Unit sold in 2022.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SWOT ANALYSIS

Strengths

* **Most Valuable Automotive Company**: It is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation.
* **Tesla Increased its Electric Vehicle Delivery**: In 2022 it increased its deliveries of 40% from 935 thousands  to 1.3 million units.
* **Cross-sell and Diversification**: Tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with Liberty Mutual insurance company.
* **Innovative Company**: Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.

## Weaknesses

* **Manufacturing Complications**: Tesla faces continuous launch, manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products. For example, Tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch Model X, which lead to constant delays for distribution. Similarly, the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing Model X’s battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1.
* **Unable to meet demand might affect brand value**: Due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures, Tesla’ might face an unbalanced supply and demand, unable to meet the production ramp.
* **Lack of High Volume Productio**n: It has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models. Even now, as the company plans to manufacture Model 3 vehicles at high volume, it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources.
* **Shortage of Batterie**s: The shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
* **Elon Musk as Tesla’s Sole Representative**: Musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests.
* **Financial Uncertainty**: Tesla has outstanding debt of $5.38 Billion. If the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt, then there is a risk of delaying expansion, reducing investments, selling assets, etc.
* **Employee Safety Concerns**: Tesla was recently fined in 2019 for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection. Also, the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching California’s heat.
* **Leadership Wrangles**: Friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and long-term success. Tesla’s management and board have been engaged in several power struggles.
* **Tesla Faces Lawsuit over Sexual Misconduct**: Many Tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace. The women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct. They also alleged that they were cat-called and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks, groping, and misogynistic behaviour.

## Opportunities

* **Sales expansion in untapped Market**: The most significant opportunity for the company right now is the Asian market, even tho there are increased risks.
* **Less Expensive Car**: Tesla’s Model 3 is a more affordable version of Model S with less range, power, and fewer features.
* **Bringing battery production technology in-house**: Tesla intends to make its own battery cells.
* **Market Confidence in Tesla**: The stock market has shown confidence in Tesla after beating the projected car deliveries.

## Threats

* **Product Liability Claims**: The company has faced lawsuits and claims related to the failure of technology in their products. If these liability claims continued, then Tesla may be subjected to greater financial setbacks.
* **Extensive Competition**: Tesla, Inc. faces aggressive competition from both alternative fuel vehicles (Hybrid, Plug-in hybrid, fully electric car) and self-driving technology. Many automotive brands in the luxury segment like Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and in the economy segment like Toyota, Ford, General Motors , Volvo are getting ready for a fierce competition. Many brands are not only launching or planning to launch their environment-friendly-Self-driving technology but also, they are offering them at a comparably lower price.
* **Product Defects**: Tesla’s cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases. The defective products often have weaknesses in design, manufacturing, and other features which harm the company’s image permanently.
* **Long term confidence**: Tesla, due to its unstable manufacturing conditions, suffers from disbelief among the public about its long-term existence, which can result in a deficiency in further business development.
* **Customer Adaptation**: The company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles.
* **Disruption of Supply Due to Shortage of Materials**: Tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices. The company uses aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper, and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. All these materials have volatile prices, which can affect the company’s production line severely in the future.
* **High-Risk Factor Due to Usage of Lithium-ion**: Tesla uses lithium-ion cells in their battery packs. Lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element, which increases the risk factor of our products. Tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke, which has defamed the company on a major level.
* **Elon Musk’s Behavior Affecting Tesla’s Reputation**: Tesla’s entire reputation is built upon the cult of Elon Musk. But recently, his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting Tesla.
* **Competitors increasing productions of EV Vehicles**: Competitors are jumping in the EV segment eating huge portions of the market share.

Fundamental analysis,options,"$NVDA: Short-Term Bull Thesis Formulated Synergistically Using Perennially-Tested, Fundamental Trend-Analysis with Harmonic Analysis Based on Fibonacci Symmetry (""Sacred Geometry"")","Welcome,

In this analysis, we'll illustrate and explain why we have become quite bullish $NVDA in the short-term using perennial, fundamental trend analysis & harmonics (based on Fibonacci symmetry) analysis synergistically. If you are reading this, we assume you have already witnessed and/or experienced the potentially powerful and remunerative effect of sound technical analysis; hence, if you have only studied classical trend analysis techniques with supportive volume flow analysis, you are in for a treat, because we potentiate the accuracy of these tools with harmonics.

We will begin with the classical, perennially-tested, fundamental trend analysis. $NVDA has been trading within a channel with the upper rail/resistance extending from Oct '18 and the lower rail/support from Apr '19, as can be viewed in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1: https://imgur.com/a/b4KYX3i 

Upon rejection from the top rail/resistance in Sep '20, it entered into a bull flag formation; after a false breakdown from this flag & a test of the multi-year channel support in early Mar '21, it surged into a major rally & broke out of the flag mid-Apr '21. Next it was rejected from resistance extending from Sep '20 above the bull flag, causing it to retest the flag's upper rail (prior resistance) as support, which it did so successfully. All of this can be viewed in Figure 2 more clearly.

FIGURE 2: https://imgur.com/a/a1JgUHT

Henceforth, the fundamental trend analysis has allowed us to understand it's still in breakout region. Now let's thoroughly examine the short-term harmonic setups which may act as technical catalysts to fuel the breakout.

On the 45-min chart, our team has identified a bullish Gartley harmonic, which acts as the large framework--within the trend's context--of our short-term bull thesis; targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 3. Also note that the volume flow is still positive on this time frame, despite the recent sell-off; hence, such divergence in volume flow supports the bull thesis. 

FIGURE 3: https://imgur.com/a/KNiobVi

On the 15-min chart (Heiken Ashi candles), our team identified a bullish ABCD harmonic, which reinforces our short-term bull thesis; again, targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 4. Volume flow is also still largely positive/bullish, despite recent sell-off.

FIGURE 4: https://imgur.com/a/yV5RIf8

Finally, on the 5-min chart (Heiken Ashi candles), our team identified a bullish Deep Crab harmonic, which is why we believe it will show strength very early next week; again, targets & invalidation level are on the chart, seen in Figure 5. The volume flow is tilted towards reflecting selling, which is expected on this extremely short-term time-frame; however, the selling was not significant enough to be reflected on the previous 15-min and 45-min frames analyzed previously.

FIGURE 5: https://imgur.com/a/Ucu4UCd

Therefore, our short-term bull thesis is frameworked by the trend-analysis (i.e. trend-analysis demonstrates $NVDA's in breakout territory), and reinforced with confluently bullish harmonic internals on multiple timeframes--the ideal, golden setup for which outperforming traders exercise the most difficult element of trading: patience.


DISCLOSURE: We do not currently hold any position in $NVDA; however, we will be looking to enter long early in the upcoming week (i.e. Mon morning) if the price remains above the invalidation levels and below the initial targets. This is educational material, and should not be considered by the reader as financial advice; one should be sure to perform one's own due diligence before entering or exiting any position in the equities markets.

Fundamental analysis,options,I built a Reddit-powered “Bloomberg terminal” to track ticker trends and identify bull/bear cases,"&#x200B;

[Quick demo](https://reddit.com/link/n4pagm/video/587cqrz434x61/player)

Hey everyone! I built a site that tracks all types of trends across reddit (mentions, comment volume, bullish sentiment, etc.). I know there’s a couple other sites out there with similar functionalities so I won’t go into this aspect too much (list of features at bottom).

Another big inconvenience I wanted to address was finding good bull/bear cases. A lot of subreddits and posts end up being echo chambers where only one viewpoint bubbles to the top so it’s hard to get unbiased opinions. Also, some of the best DD can be found nested in the comments, and those can be hard to weed out. That’s why I added the ability to filter for analysis (in posts and comments) by financial sentiment (bull/bear) to help you find opinions from both sides of the spectrum. The term “analysis” encompasses things like DD, company/fundamental analysis, news, etc. This tool can be found on the “Ticker View” Page under the “Analysis Screener” tab.

Here’s a brief list of features:

* Chart with mentions/sentiment/price data over time for a particular ticker
* Reddit post feed filterable by ticker, subreddit, and flair
* Analysis Bias screener allowing you to sort analysis (DD, company analysis, news, etc.)
* News/financial data feed for a selected ticker
* Graph showing the most popular (mentions/sentiment/score) tickers over different time frames
* Sortable table for trends on the “Overall Trends” page, where you can see the top 50 tickers sorted by mentions, mentions change, sentiment, sentiment change, etc.
* Price Action Filtering page, allowing you to discover tickers based on price changes, combined with trend data (for example, if you wanted to see which tickers dropped 50% in price over a week that are above a certain popularity threshold)

Note that financial sentiment may not be as accurate for non-analysis posts, as it’s harder to pinpoint a positive/negative viewpoint for less research-based posts. Also, posts that have bullish and bearish sentiment may be classified incorrectly. Obviously, the model doesn’t perform perfectly.

TLDR - Made a site that tracks ticker trends/sentiment throughout reddit and helps you filter bullish/bearish analysis for unbiased viewpoints.

Technical analysis,options,$SPY Technical Analysis – Very Bearish $244p 3/20 & $225p 4/3,"For the Retards: The fed cut the rate and futures still bombed 1000 points. There’s no supports after 242. The bottom has fallen out on SPY and tbh I have no idea where it stops but I’m sure it’s going down.

Ticker: $SPY

Intervals: 1W, 1D, 1H

Indicators: Aroon, RSI, MA(200 & 50), ATR, NetVolume, News Catalysts

Signals: 1W Aroon Signal Bearish, NetVolume Overwhelmingly Bearish, Under 200 & 50 MA Bearish  
 Position: Short Term $244p 3/20 & Long Term $225p 4/3 

Targets: Take most of your profit at 243 and let some of your puts ride when it dips under.

News: “Stock futures plunged Sunday night even after the Federal Reserve embarked on a massive monetary stimulus campaign to curb slower economic growth amid the coronavirus outbreak. While the central bank’s actions may help ease the functioning of markets, many investors said they would ultimately want to see coronavirus cases peaking and falling in the U.S. before it was safe to take on risk and buy equities again.

Stock market futures hit “limit down” levels of 5% lower, a move made by the CME futures exchange to reduce panic in markets. No prices can trade below that threshold, only at higher prices than that down 5% limit.,"" (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/traders-await-futures-open-after-fed-cuts-rates-launches-easing-program.html)

Technical analysis,options,we hear a lot about Technical analysis being bogus but are price action strategies proven to work?,"You go online and hear many people talk bad about technical analysis. Often times these experts compare it to astrology, they thinks it's all pseudoscience. Why is it that they think this.

A couple years ago I was told about a research done that should price action strategies/trading is actually the only proven type of technical analysis. I can't seem to find it (maybe you can help me with it). With quantitative analysis, how retail traders like us use it to help make successful trades?",58,"TA is a big tent. Some of it is really voodoo out there, like Lunar Cycle Analysis. But the core of TA is just statistics and math. Nothing mystical or astrological about a simple moving average. **Used appropriately**, statistics and math can give you ballpark estimates of direction and momentum. Can it guarantee that a trend line will continue long enough to make a profit? No. Can it guarantee that a resistance line will hold? No.

A good way to get perspective on TA is that **TA is always about looking in the rearview mirror**. It can only tell you what happened in the past. It can't tell you what will happen in the future. You could be driving up to a pot of gold, or slamming into the rear of an 18 wheeler. TA won't tell you either way.

TA is a toolbox and unskilled and stupid people can misuse any tool and make ridiculous claims that give the whole toolbox a bad name, like all you need to build a house is a hammer. Does that really mean that every tool in the box is bogus? No.

Probably the most useful guidance I can give you is that with trading, you can either set a profit (or loss) goal, or a time goal, you can't set both. So if you want to make a 10% profit, you can definitely achieve that goal. I just can't tell you when that might happen. If you want to run a trade for 10 days, you can do that. I just can't tell you how much you will gain or lose after 10 days.

So, to trade price action, you need to control *the range of* one or both dimensions. This is why day trading is mostly about price action, because it focuses mainly on very modest profit/loss targets over very short amounts of time, so the uncertainty of the free variable moves within (usually) tight constraints. In other words, it's a way to control for uncertainty.",We hear a lot of people holding bags talk about TA being bogus... TA is the study of price action.

Technical analysis,options,"FB, AMZN, AAPL Technical Analysis","FB Analysis 

FB has been trending in an upward channel divided by a top and bottom half. On Monday last week it has broken through the middle into the bottom half, tested the 55 EMA (green line) and passed the test, meaning it held the level. $270.50 will be the key level to watch this week.

If it can hold $270.50 it has room to test $280, if that is claimed, then room to the middle of the channel at $285.30. If that level can be claimed, then room to $292.50

If it cannot hold the $276.50 level, then room to test last days' lows around $274. If that level is broken to the downside, then it has room to test the 55 EMA (green line) at $269.50. It is also the bottom of the channel, so will be a very strong level to test. If it breaks that with conviction to the downside then room down to $259 and lower.

Overall Sentiment: Neutral/Bullish

AMZN

AMZN has been one of those stocks impacted positively by the pandemic. It has been performing very well in the last months. Nevertheless it has been in consolidation mode recently trading between $2870 and $3550. At th moment the stock has been rejected by the 55 EMA (green line) to the downside, and is now slowly retracing back up to test it. The key level to watch for this week will be $3110.

If it can hold $3110, then it has room to the 55 EMA (green line) at $3160. If it can reclaim that level then room to test $3225. If it can claim that level, then room to $3289.

If it cannot hold $3110 then room down to test $3080. If that level cannot hold, then room down to $3020, and if that doesn't hold, then room to test ercent lows at $2951.70. Next level after that is a strong support at $2871.

AAPL

Apple is the most popular stock out there. After an incredible run it has been consolidating between the $100 and $135 range, getting tighter and tighter as the weeks pass since it hit All Time Highs early September. It is currently, trying to reclaim and trade on levels above the 118 support. $118 and $115 will be key level to watch this week.

If it can hold the $118 level with conviction, room to $121.50, and if it holds that it can test $125 which is recent highs.

If it cannot hold $118 then it will go down to $115 and test the 55 EMA (green line). If it cannot hold that then room to $112.25.

Overall Sentiment: Neutral
Options: If it can hold $118 looking at the Nov 20 $125 Calls: If it cannot hold $118 looking at $115 Puts, if it starts to fall hard then roll into $110 (lots of volume and cheap)

Technical analysis,options,CONTROVERSIAL OPINION: Technical Analysis is unnecessary.,"Every week, I see people **get wrecked** placing trades based on TA - which is why I am fully convinced TA is unnecessary at best (and dangerous at worst).   Trying to predict what the market is going to do based on past pricing is a fools errand.  No one can consistently predict short-term direction.

To back me up on this, here's Warren Buffett:

&amp;gt;""Let me be clear about on one point; I can't predict the short-term movements of the stock market. I haven't the faintest idea as to whether stocks will be higher or lower a month or a year from now.""

And now, let *me* be clear; I'm not sayin TA doesn't work at all.  Maybe it does to some degree; who knows.   I'm saying even if it does, what's the point of spending time on it when the findings are already ""priced in.""

To put it succinctly, my argument is that the most current and relevant information you need to make a trade decision is contained within:

* Options Pricing / Probability
* Implied Volatility / IV Rank %


--Options Pricing / Probability--

A bunch of smart, well educated people, who are paid a lot of money, to conduct *real* Due Diligence, and gather *real* data (like how many shipping containers left china on Monday), are placing huge bets on where the stock is headed in the future -- and it's all reflected in option pricing / probability.  

And as I mentioned above, even if TA is useful, those same smart people are already using it and have already priced in their findings.  So IMHO, taking time to learn how to draw lines on a chart isn’t an efficient use of time since the conclusions drawn from those lines are already reflected in the option price / probability of the trade.


\
--Implied Volatility  / IV Rank %--

The real edge is in using implied volatility.  I do believe that IV reverts to the mean over time so if IV is high, you can expect it to eventually go lower and visa versa.  This means, if you're an option buyer, look for low IV / IV rank %  (buy at low prices), and if you're an option seller, look for high IV / IV Rank % (sell high at high prices).   And to all my option sellers, it's been shown that [theoretical IV often differs from actual IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amao0pJE1XI) so if you're looking for an additional edge, there it is.

For more on the subject, [here's an old TastyTrade video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD6Z9m4u08A) explaining why IV is the most important factor when determining which underlying to trade.

**TL;DR -** Stop drawing lines and let the paid professionals, who are are highly trained, experienced, *and* have access to the best data, do the bulk of the work for you\*.  From what I've seen, investing is one of the few endeavors in life where the average person can make above average returns by doing *less.*  

\***Strong opinion; loosely held.**  Open to hearing what others have to say on the subject.",64,"If everything was priced in the stock would gap to the level it should be 'valued' at based on the 'experts' opinion and sit there. That's not how trading works. People buy and sell. TA in its very basic form is the analysis of supply and demand trends.

Every successful trader I know uses some form of TA even if they don't call it that or use it with other metrics. Even if you don't use it, it wouldn't hurt to learn it so you know what the idiots are trying to chase that day so you can do the opposite. Then again, selling to the crowd to help create resistance would technically be technical analysis.","In options maybe, but is an essential tool when trading futures. You can make a killing if you find yourself on the right side of ES.","TA is a broad umbrella. I'll agree that pattern charting is BS, but you're not doing yourself any favors if you're ignorant of what beta or momentum is.

One final point, I'm not sure of anything better than using moving averages to avoid value traps. Value and momentum is a great combo with lots of research to back it up.

The only other way I'd use TA is in a minimum variance (not to be confused with low volatility) strategy, but that's equities, not options."

Technical analysis,options,"Strategy: Cut your loses, or trust your technical analysis and ride out until expiry date?","Hi friends,

I am fairly new to Option trading, so I kindly ask you wait to tear me apart until I become at least a little more experienced - then you can go crazy. I had bought some call options for September that I believe will rise and I set them aside (they're down now but since it's a long-term play I am not worried).  But in the mean time, I decided to practice my technical analysis and complete some shorter option plays. The past week I had completed enough research and analysis that I was confident on one position (just so you can follow along as a reference: 4/28 $SPY Put Options at a $414 strike), so when price had dropped yesterday as I predicted, you could probably guess that I had an inflated sense of ""getting the hang of it"". As you might know, today it is not headed towards what target price I think it *should* drop to and rather up towards record highs.

This is where my title question comes in. At what point do you decide to cut your losses (about 33% here right now) but recoup some money, or to play it out towards expiry just hoping that what everything you have read and analyzed will be correct? I still have confidence in my research and believe that tomorrow could be a very red day in response to a new resistance level, but then again I do not want to be foolish. Would losing all the money break me? No, but it will still hurt at the very least.

Thank you very much for helping me on my journey.

UPDATE: Cut my loses at 54%. I’d rather have something than nothing.",29,"ive always cut my losses at the 20% mark, if i'm really pushing it, the 30% mark

Risk management,options,Rules of Risk Management,"Given the current environment and with the past two days wiping out many new traders, I feel that it is appropriate to post my Rules of Risk Management, which have been requested by others on previous posts.

As a former fund manager and trader/investor with two decades of experience under my belt, here are the rules I have developed for myself concerning the trading of options:

**1) Never invest with money that you cannot afford to lose.** This is the cardinal rule of risk management.

**2) Limit your overall exposure in any single position** (this includes multiple directional positions on the same underlying) to a maximum percentage of your portfolio that does not exceed 1% for larger accounts ($100k+) and 2.5% for smaller accounts ($10k and below).

**3) Always analyze the direction of implied volatility prior to entering a trade.** Only look at debit strategies when IV percentile is low and only look at credit generating strategies when IV percentile is high. In situations where you decide to take a directional trade (bullish or bearish), the use of spreads is recommended when IV is elevated as this will negate much of the risk associated with both Vega (volatility decay) and Theta (time decay).

**4) Longer time horizons are advisable in selecting expiration dates for debit positions** and the use of shorter duration credit spreads can significantly reduce your risk, thus elevating your probability of profit.

**5) Where liquidity is concerned - only trade options that are highly liquid**, meaning that they have high open interest and, thus, tighter bid and ask spreads, which will significantly lower the slippage on each trade you take.

**6) Asymmetry of risk - only enter debit positions that offer 2 or more units of potential reward for every unit of risk.** This means that if you're risking $1 on a trade, your potential return should be at least $2. For credit positions, this is not feasible, thus, the tradeoff becomes taking in a credit with an exceptionally high probability of profit, which provides a positive expected value on the trade (for those of you unfamiliar with the term expected value - there's this thing called Google).

**7) Maintaining a cash position of greater than 50% of your portfolio value is always advisable** (I personally maintain 80% cash at all times). You never know when a position is going to go against you or when an exceptional trade/investment opportunity will arise, thus you want to be in a position of optionality with respect to taking a new favourable position or adjusting an existing one.

**8) Scale into your positions by laddering your orders.** This is especially important for those with larger account sizes since you can attain much better average prices on your positions by buying incrementally (or selling credit positions incrementally). For example, if you have $1,000 to allocate to a single position (assuming a portfolio value in excess of $100k), you can allocate $250 in 4 separate orders (or $500 in 2 separate orders). Conversely, when selling your positions, you should always scale out, which will allow you to ride your winners much longer than you normally would by incrementally taking risk off the table, which detaches you emotionally from your trade.

**9) Manage your emotions and avoid FOMO.** Option trading is a strategic game that should be done with much care, patience, and discipline. By managing your emotions and working strategically, as a trader, you will develop a pattern of decision-making, which is integral to your profitability and success over a long time horizon. FOMO is a terrible thing because it causes you to chase trades that have already passed you by. Focus on your trades, not what everyone else is doing.

**10) Put aside money for taxes and live within your means.** Assuming you follow the above rules (and have a solid fundamental understanding of how options and the financial markets work), you should see profits in the long run, which means that you need to be disciplined in squirrelling away money for tax purposes (so that JPow and his band of merry morons can continue giving it away to those of you who are living off of everyone else). Read up on the tax laws where you reside and if you're generating enough profits, hire a proper accountant to take care of your taxes for you.

**Bonus rule:** Document all of your trades in a trade journal - if you DM me, I'd be happy to send you a copy of the excel template I use.

\-----

Godspeed and if you're serious about making your money work for you long-term instead of working for your money long-term, memorize these rules and apply them. Or don't, and continue chasing tendies like the majority of undisciplined individuals I've come across while repeatedly saying ""would you like fries with that?"".

The choice is yours.

I called Robinhood which said their risk management team did so because of the risk associated with my long calls potentially closing the day in the money and being exercised for whatever million.

Risk management,options,Options Risk Management,"Does anyone have an options risk management strategy that really works (meaning it provides consistent profitability) for swing trading of long calls and puts and long and short vertical spreads? 

The “prevailing wisdom” (which I would characterize as “swinging for the fences”) of starting to take profits at a 100% gain (while leaving “runners”, if holding multiple contracts) on long naked options and debit spreads (or alternatively, when the short strike is hit for the latter), stopping out at a 50% loss, and a 90% gain/100% loss on credit spreads, leads to too low a success rate for me and too many (painful) reversals and drawdowns.  I know it should also depend on support and resistance levels, but assume those aren’t hit or broken before the profit target or stop is hit.

I’ve seen some traders start taking profits on long naked options at as little as a 20% profit, while setting stops at breaks of intraday support or resistance, meaning their RTR isn’t quantified, which doesn’t make sense to me. On the other hand, if they were to set stops at, say, a 10% loss, that would result in being stopped out of too many trades and could only work for day-trading, as overnight gaps could result in losses much bigger than 10%.

I’ve also seen someone (a popular guru who runs a trading alert device) who claims a high success rate and consistent profitability from a credit spread strategy (strictly bull put spreads, to wit), that starts taking profits at as little as 20%, though I’m not sure how he sets his targets.",4,"if you want ""consistent profitability"", go with high grade bonds, and/or companies with either proven dividend track records or high quality preferred stocks.

I would treat it like a long or short stock position because your long or short bias is derived from the price action of the chart.

Randomly taking profit on a long position because you are up on it without the security hitting supply is technically mismanaging the position
Risk management,options,Lesson From This Week's Volatility - Risk Management,"The markets handed a tough lesson this week to many options traders. Some may never return, most  will be licking their wounds for weeks or months, and a very few will take this as an opportunity to trade the carnage. The lesson to learn is not about your trading strategy or indicators, but risk management.

I have worked as a market strategist for the past 15 years alongside a few thousand retail and institutional investors in foreign currency, futures, equities and options. A common experience amongst self-directed investors is a repetitive string of small winners, followed by a few big losses that wipe out weeks or months of gains. This is because the common theme with successful traders isn’t their strategy or which indicators they use, but rather their process for risk management.

There is no shortage of empirical evidence and studies, examining how humans skew our view on risk and reward. Research shows that accepting a loss is viewed to be twice as painful compared to the same amount of gain. This leads to the behavior of hanging onto losers far too long and closing winners far too soon. 

The reality of investing is that there will be losing trades and one must first accept this as a fact. In my experience, it is the pursuit of preventing small losses that ironically triggers some of the largest losses. We may have all experienced having a small loss, adding to the position with the hope of getting back to breakeven, only to have the position decline even further into a larger loss. Unfortunately, some investors will compound this habit, resulting in a total account blowup or loss. This begs the question; how do we trick our brain into turning this around?

To help with this quirk of human nature, professionals turn to a rules-based approach. First, there needs to be a decoupling of the concept of winning trades from being profitable. While the two are correlated they are not bound together. Most investors that struggle, make the incorrect assumption, that if they just win more often, they will be profitable. However, evidence shows that it is far more likely that a few big losses are typically what pushes accounts into the negative. To this point, the primary focus of investors is not to prevent losses in the first place, but only to prevent large losses. This can be achieved through discipline with the help of trading tools such as stop loss orders, option strategies with limited risk, and never risking more than 2% of your account per trade. Moreover, it is best to never add risk to a losing position.

Trading is an infinite game, not a finite game, yet 95% of traders still try to ""win"" every trade. There is no such thing as winning in trading, when you focus on the wrong goal, that's when you spin your wheels and get nowhere.  If you don't understand this, do a quick google search on ""finite vs. infinite game"".

Take this lesson into next week, if you're in a losing position on Friday's close and ""hoping"" to get yourself back to breakeven next week, think twice if it's worth blowing up the rest of your account for it. Or do you take a loss and regroup?",440,"Please repost this in 200 point billboard size font for importance and so that everyone reads it, and then reads it again.

It's the same solution here as it was to the [Saint Petersburg Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox) however the problem lies in three major mindsets:

1. Few people have real targets. They believe they need to make it to millions or more when in fact most people can live comfortably their normal lives off of significantly less.
2. They just enter bad trades. Most of the trading losses here are from FOMO. They have no rules (as you stated) but without a goal they also have no incentives to quit which leads to poor trading; it was no secret that Tesla was overvalued and the market was overheating. It was obvious. The smart people left that nonsense alone.
3. There is an end. The goal of trading for the retail investor *is specifically to quit trading*. I say this to people. They vomit thinking it's madness. However if people traded like the goal was to quit trading they would trade better; it's like working any other job all your life where the goal is to eventually earn enough to retire (which has many definitions but is easily understood to be universal financial freedom) and stop working for money.

Risk management,options,Selling Options Risk Managment,"Hey,

first sorry for my english..

so I was wondering what kind of Risk Management you guys use when selling Options, or rather which one I should use because all of them arent really optimal in my mind.

I want to sell options on futures with a delta of 10 and DTE of 60-120

Here a all the risk managment strategys i know..

1. Use a 100% ""Stop"" so if the Option doubles in price  you just buy it back maually
2. Spreads (or other fancy option combinations)
3. Buy the option back when the underlying broke a chart pattern (trend, support...)
4. dont do anything
5. roll the option 
6. strangle if it goes against you or other strategies for repairing

&#x200B;

1. 

I have some problems with what they teach in a lot of books.

Because they say if you sell an option and as long as the price is above/below the srike you make money but then they also recommend to use a 100% ""stop"", so when the option doubled in price you buy it back to limit risk. But if you do that you have to time the market because essentially the first day is the most important and the second one the second most importat and so on. 

real Example: I sold a bull put spread at delta 10, 100DTE,  and the next day the market was down like 2% and my position was -80% so if the third day was also going down I would have been ""stoppt out"" even though my stike was waaay below the current price 

So the profit line isnt the straight stike line its a curve thats pretty close to the actual price in the beginnig and it slowly goes to the stike line, because afer 30days a underlying move of 3% doesnt change a whole lot where a 3% move the first day could stop you out..

&#x200B;

2.

 I find the risk to reward ratio too slim to just spread and dont do anything else..

I always want to spread but only in combination with antoher safety mechanism..

&#x200B;

3.

Again timing is a problem because if your imaginary stop is at a support level like lets say 5% below the price of entry and its being reached in the first week of your 100DTE option youre going to loose a lot of money.. in comparison if the exact same happens 60days later you dont lose nearly as much or you could even be in profit

&#x200B;

4.

Stupid (except cash secured or covered)

&#x200B;

5.

for me its doubling down if you dont want the underlying. If you want the undelying its not doubling down because you just get it cheaper. But if you dont want the underlying and you have a 100% stop in place you essantially double down.. Sell option for 100$ it doubles to 200$ your stop triggers you roll and sell an option for 200$ it doubles againg to 400$ now and so on...(worst case)

&#x200B;

6.

didnt try it yet dont know if i like it

&#x200B;

&#x200B;",4,"All good questions. We have some explainers about risk management in our wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_planning/) that you can read.

> I want to sell options on futures with a delta of 10 and DTE of 60-120

Puts or calls? Risk management is different depending on which type. Selling calls is generally riskier than selling puts, since naked short calls have unlimited loss potential.

**TL;DR** -- Overall, one of the most effective risk management techniques is **right sizing**. Don't size up more than your risk tolerance can take. Trade small so that you can be indifferent to a 100% loss, or even ten 100% losses in a row.

> Use a 100% ""Stop"" so if the Option doubles in price you just buy it back maually ... So the profit line isnt the straight stike line its a curve thats pretty close to the actual price in the beginnig and it slowly goes to the stike line, because afer 30days a underlying move of 3% doesnt change a whole lot where a 3% move the first day could stop you out..

That is more of a problem with the 100% being too ""tight"" than the technique itself. And it only seems wrong because the position recovered. What if it didn't? What if it lost 100% the first day and then another 100% the second day and then another 100% the third day, etc.? You're going to regret not having that 100% stop out on day one.

If you want to say it is hard to pick a good stop limit level in the face of volatility over time, I agree with that. But being hard doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

> Spreads (or other fancy option combinations)

Not all spreads, only **defined-risk** spreads. They might just change the profit/loss profile. For example, both a naked short call and a short straddle spread have unlimited loss potential.

> Buy the option back when the underlying broke a chart pattern (trend, support...)

More generally, set a loss limit on the trade and close it if it reaches or passes that limit. Again, this is just part of an overall exit strategy.

> dont do anything

I suppose no decision is also a decision.

> roll the option

Rolling is a technique that is indifferent to whether it increases or decreases risk, so I would not include it as part of risk management. You can roll a profitable trade to maintain the same, less than, or greater than level of risk.

> strangle if it goes against you or other strategies for repairing

Yes, there are various rescue strategies, all of which seem of dubious value as risk management to me. They often *add* more risk.","I agree with the other reply that position size is the primary tool. 

Anything that depends on closing or rolling may fail catastrophically during fast markets. This is when risk management matters most. 

Take the example of closing at 100 percent loss. If the stock gaps, the next tick might mean a 500 percent or worse loss. 

Trading halts. Changes in margin requirements are when most calm market techniques will fail. Game over for those that counted on orderly markets where rolling or closing at a reasonable price is taken for granted. 

Whatever a person decides have a plan for up down unchanged before getting in. Trade long enough and the worst case will happen. 

Someone asking basic questions is probably better off staying risk defined for a long while longer.",close your eyes and jump

The trade was a very wide short iron condor in RUT that was a very high probability trade. There it was, that was the plan. 

As we can all see the series of glaring issues here, a couple stand out specifically:
-I relied on probabilities to manage my risk. This was pure ignorance. 
-I didn’t size properly. I was too focused on what I was trying to make vs how the trade would behave during its lifecycle. 

I made this mistake once and it was the largest % drawdown (I’ve lost far more on a raw $ basis) on my account over the past 15 trading years. Sure the trade “set me back” but that’s all relative anyways so that part didn’t bother me. The issue was I failed to understand these high POP trades simply defer the risk into the future where at some point, if we continue the same strategy long enough, will eventually be realized.

I congratulate you on the awareness to learn these 2 lessons, even if it came from a painful experience.  This is how we grow and improve as traders, well done!","Not sure why probability is a positive under your risk management. 

Almost by definition, higher probability of profit means lower reward/risk ratio so it should be a negative.

You take on risk getting on a subway , getting in a car, a plane . 

An iron condor is a crappy trade as most spreads are . Why? Their rate of failure is 74-96% . The more elements there are to a trade , the higher the loss probability . Also you are limiting your profit in return for premium . Any pop higher than your wingspan denies maximum profit . 

In a casino the best is red or black at the roulette table . If not for the green zeros it would be 50/50. The house lives on the small percentage of the green zero . In craps 7 has one additional probability over 6, the house lives on that

Spreads , vertical , diagonal, calendar are all limiting and really reduce your odds . Vest you can do in a credit spread is keep premium . Most times the best you do in a 10 point wingspan debit spread is 60/40. Cost you 400 to set up maybe 300 and bring you back 600-700. Meh

# Introduction

I've been seeing a lot of posts lately from people blowing up their accounts in one way or another, and I would say most if not all of these happened because of a lack of risk management. When you're trying to build an options portfolio, there are strategies and rules you can implement to minimize the chances of half your portfolio evaporating.

# Money Management and Position Sizing

There was a study in 2016 where participants were given $25 and were asked to bet on coin clips for 30 minutes. The coin was weighed so it would land on heads 60% of the time, but the payout was 1:1. Despite the obvious mathematical advantage, 28% of the participants wiped out. out of 61 participants, 18 bet their entire bankroll in one go.

Position sizing is especially important when options trading. Yes, you might have an edge, but variance is always worse than you expect. If you wouldn't bet your net worth on a coin toss, why would you bet more than you can afford to lose on weeklies that expire worthless 70% of the time? By keeping your individual position sizes small, you reduce the risk of any single trade wiping you out. Check out the Kelly criterion if you want to learn more about ""optimal"" betting sizes.

Personally, I try to keep the risk of each position under 5% of my portfolio. That doesn't necessarily mean that I can only spend 5% of my portfolio buying power on one trade, but I might have a stop loss equal to a 5% loss of my overall portfolio.

For example, if you have a $1,000 account, you can spend $200 on RKT weeklies if you want, but if you follow the 5% rule, you should have a stop loss and close the trade when your calls lose $50.

On top of that, I wouldn’t have more than 50% of my account at risk at any given time. This way, I can buy the dip when it happens, or give my (short) positions a bit of extra margin if things go wrong. Options utilize leverage, so you don't need to use every dollar of buying power available to you.

# Asset Diversification

Aside from keeping your account in multiple smaller positions, you want to keep your holdings in different assets. If you have a bunch of small positions but they're all in meme/tech stocks, you're probably not having a good month right about now. Spread out your trades across different sectors of stocks. A portfolio with PLTR, RKT, BLNK, NIO, and TSLA is going to be a lot risker than a portfolio with PLTR, GLD, SPY, BA, and TLT. I'm not saying don't trade the meme stocks, but they shouldn't be 80% of your portfolio.

Good tickers to trade are liquid, well known, and generally not too correlated with each other. An example watchlist could be AAPL, BA, CRSR, SPY, IWM, QQQ, PLTR, GLD, WMT, and MS. The broad market indexes SPY, IWM, and QQQ are more correlated than most, but you can use them to adjust your portfolio - IWM is more small caps, and QQQ is good for tech exposure.

# Directional Diversification

In addition to trading different stocks, you might also want to trade in different directions. Stocks in different sectors might be less correlated, but a broader market downturn could still hurt your portfolio. You might want to have long deltas for some of your positions and short deltas on other stocks.

Maybe you think that the financial sector is going to outperform and tech is on a bit of a downwards trend, maybe you want to be short tech for a while instead of just waiting to buy the dip. I'm personally a net seller of options, so I might sell put spread on MS and call spreads on AAPL. This way, even when the broader market dips I'm okay since at least one of my trades will do really well.

It's good practice to look at the beta of your portfolio, and see what your PnL looks like compared to moves in a benchmark of your choice. Your broker should be able to calculate how correlated individual stocks are to your benchmark and determine how your portfolio is affected by market conditions. If your broker doesn't do that, please get a better broker. If you're playing on Robinhood with a few hundred bucks, fine. But if you're trading seriously and have a profit goal instead of an entertainment budget, please switch to something like TOS or IBKR.

For me, IBKR's risk navigator lets me know that by next month, I'll make $500 on my overall (theta gang) portfolio as long as SPY stays within +/- 5% of where it is today. Of course, I can boost my returns even more through managing my trades; squeezing some more gains out of my winners, and losing the minimum on trades that go wrong.

# Volatility Diversification

Ever hear of IV crush? When you buy calls right before earnings, your stock pops up 10% the next day, and you still lose all your money? That's implied volatility working against you. Similarly, if you're only long vega and the market + the VIX calms down, it's suddenly a lot harder for you to make money. Even directionally uncorrelated assets like SPY and TLT have correlated volatility; when the market tanks, everybody rushes into bonds for safety. While SPY falls and TLT increases, both have become more volatile for different reasons. If you've only got Iron Condors on these two tickers, you might be in trouble.

Have some positions that benefit from increased volatility and some that are the other way around. If you only have short strangles and credit spreads, maybe try some calendar spreads on stocks with lower volatility. If you only have debit spreads, maybe you might want to sell some Iron Condors on med-high IV rank stocks.",209,"There are also resources, links, frequent answers on risk reduction, trade size, and more at the

Risk management,options,Options selling and risk management,"\--- Update below ---   
In the past my options trading was very volatile with just buying calls and puts with no real strategy. I made money and lost money by luck. I have been studying options for few months now and finally landed on selling strategy.

I have been selling spread options and iron condors for 2 months now and I have 90% success ratio. I am not sure if this is luck or I have found the option trading style that works for me. My positions carry around 20-30% risk. So for $5000 risk trade I keep $1000. I am using few options tools which show me percentage of profitability based on Black-Scholes-Merton model. These positions are normally around 90% chance.

I am sure this will not last long and I am afraid one big swing in market will erase all my profit of 2 months.

I have positions in SPY / GLD / NVDA / COST for this month. Lets say each position I am carrying $5000 risk so total $20,000 risk and I am making $4000 if they all expire worthless.

If the market drops like a hot potato then I may have to roll over my positions or take total loss.

Note that I dont have stop order loss due to nature of volatile market, I like to keep a close eye on them.

What do you guys suggest, how should I improve on this process ? Thanks for any suggestions, here to learn.

\--- Update --- 

Yup , luck ran out and blew up the account thanks to market melt up. Exactly this happened what I was afraid of, good thing is lots of knowledge acquired to fill the gap. My SPY short call was assigned early and I did not get a chance to roll out. I ended up exercising my long and short and took loss which basically puts me now at net zero YTD. 

&#x200B;",3,"Congrats by moving from buying to selling, now consider moving from spreads and ICs to selling puts on stocks you would not mind owning, and then selling covered calls if assigned the shares.

Spreads and ICs have costly long legs that reduce premiums, profit slower and are hard to roll or manage.  Selling puts on high quality stocks will bring in more premium for the same delta, profit faster and are easily rolled.

Most of 2023 has been a cake walk with easy profits, but this won't last and it will get harder.  One of the best places to be in a drop is high quality stocks.

If you are worried, I would address the wheel . I never read Scottishtraders style ,but I have a strong sense that holding some stock and holding some options is less leveraged and brings down your risk. 

I would then allocate only 10 percent to spreads,  and then 5-10 to buying calls/puts , or hedging your portfolio.

Risk management,options,Risk management with small accounts?,"Hey so I’m new to this sub so sorry if it doesn’t belong, but I’ve been trading for a couple years now and the one thing I keep struggling with is risk management with smaller accounts. I’m still profitable but it seems my 2 weeks of 5% gain a day gets knocked out by one unlucky trade. Any tips?",3,"This is a great question.

Our usual risk-management suggestion is to not risk more than 5% of your account liquidation value in any one trade. But if you only have $1000 liquidation value, that severely limits your ability to trade options, since very few option trades only risk $50.

So there are two possibilities:

1. Don't trade until you have enough cash where 5% provides you with sufficient choice of trades. As hard as that may be to hear, its usually the best advice.

1. Expect to blow up your account and refill, multiple times. If you have a good source of earned income, like a good paying job, this might be an acceptable alternative. You're basically borrowing against your future income.

If you do *not* have a good source of earned income that you can borrow against, you're only rational choice is to save up cash until you can trade with more risk.","What are you doing? Have any stocks, long options, selling options, spreads , or etc?

Market trends,options,Rangebound vs Trending Markets - Stopping Theta Gang From Stealing Your Money,"#  I. Introduction

I'm sure every one has been robbed by Theta Gang once or twice whilst YOLOing on FDs. There is nothing worst than death by a thousand cuts chopfest bringing your option to zero even though the stock hasn't moved. This post is going to show you how to identify that BEFORE you enter a trade - and how to get AROUND it altogether.

Markets only do two things: **they consolidate - or chop within a defined range gathering energy for the next move, and they trend - or break a defined range, moving in a straight line towards a new one.** This is the basis of most technical analysis and technical patterns.

Markets **consolidate about 70% of the time** and **trend about 30% of the time** \- but **most people only know how to trade the 30%!** This is why many fail - it's important to understand both scenarios.

# II. Rangebound Markets

This is when a market is chopping within a clearly defined range. Price will sell at the highs - and rise at the lows - constantly reverting to the ""mean"". The mean in this case is usually the center of the range. Price is chopping because it wants to see what buyers and sellers think of this range. Also, key players are building new positions here.

Basically - you are going to see a lot of chop with no clear direction - and long options holders of both varieties will get brutally fucked. IWM is a great example. It's been rangebound for 6 months.

# III. Trending Markets

This is when a market is moving in one direction - breaking into a new range. Price is ready to go; subsequently, buyers and sellers have finished adjusting their positions for the next move. The amount of time we spent rangebound determines the length of the trending move. The longer the better - and the wider the range, the better.

This is when you want to buy long options. Price will move perfectly for them to profit - and theta gang usually won't be an issue.

# IV. Practical Applications

* **Rangebound Markets**

In a market like this, the best strategies are mean reversion strategies. This means to buy the dip and sell the rip. You generally want to **stay away from short dated long options altogether** and play **with theta gang.** This means put credit spreads at the lows, call credit spreads at the highs. You could also use calendar spreads, or any other theta positive play. You want time and chop to be **working for you not against you.**

First though - you need to **identify the range.** You can do this through **technical patterns - or key levels.** Technical patterns are simply lines that define the range the price is consolidating - and when price is no longer consolidating. They are your roadmap for avoiding the chop, and playing the eventual breakout.

Put credits and call credits will work the best when price is near extremes and implied volatility is high. Calendar spreads will work best when implied volatility is low.

Let's take a look at an example to reinforce our understanding:

[RTY \(IWM\) 1 Year 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/juqou5c8zsh71.png?width=2249&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa69d69cb3790ee010a184541ebfc3d0a9353c89)

If you read my previous post you know that IWM is the small cap index - or **the index everyones favorite meme stocks are in.**

Look at what it's been doing for 6+ months. Its literally in the same spot! All it's done is chop back in forth in this defined range. You can identify said range by drawing a line connecting the highs and the lows - and you will see it forms a **symmetrical triangle.** This is a common technical pattern. When coming from upside the **end result is biased bullish -** but in the mean time price is going to chop sideways, fucking your options.

In this situation, you either want to buy the low of the triangle and sell the top - or you want to buy the breakout (a daily close above or below). This is massive pattern, so the breakout will likely bring a massive move.

* **Trending Markets**

Here - you want to play on the momentum side. This means playing options where volatility works in your favor, like **regular old calls, puts - even straddles/strangles. You can get away with short dated options here.** If these are your primary method of making money - stay out of rangebound markets and only play trending ones! You have to know when it's time to sit out - **cash is a position too.**

When the market is trending is when retail is printing and social media is ripe with meme stock gains - because the vast majority of retail only knows about momentum trading and doesn't know another way exists. This is how big players like it, so they can steal your money the other 70% of the time.

Here's an example of a trending market:

[ES \(SPY\) 1 Year 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/tyisfph9zsh71.png?width=2249&format=png&auto=webp&s=69208038ac6d242615513552ccf2e22c6a69bc90)

Price makes new all time highs every couple weeks ever since it broke that range that lasted from last September to last November. Until we break some of those trendlines down - you can expect it to continue - and you can ride the wave. Since it's a bullish trend - in this market you want to **buy the dip** and look for smaller technical patterns to **buy breakouts.**

However - for the best play on a trending market - you usually want to enter the moment the technical pattern that creates the trend breaks. For instance, when that IWM triangle finally breaks. This gives you the best risk reward, since you can stop loss just below the breakout. In this case, you wanted to enter calls in November and buy the dip every drop since.

# V. TL;DR

Markets only do two things: **they consolidate - or chop within a defined range gathering energy for the next move, and they trend - or break a defined range, moving in a straight line towards a new one.** This is the basis of most technical analysis and technical patterns.

* **Rangebound Markets**

This is when a market is chopping within a clearly defined range.

In a market like this, the best strategies are mean reversion strategies. This means to buy the dip and sell the rip.

* **Trending Markets**

This is when a market is moving in one direction - breaking into a new range.

This is also when you want to buy long options. Price will move perfectly for them to profit - and theta gang usually won't be an issue.

Market trends,options,5 Tips For Exiting Trades,"  

Most novice traders are taught to think about their exits in one dimension. For instance, the stop should be 1% lower and the target should be 2% higher. This mechanical process does not account for other factors that are impacting the stock. Here are 5 things you should include in your exit strategy.

1. **Market conditions**. Every trade needs to start and end with the market. I always start with the daily chart to get a feel for the momentum. In the chart below you would be more aggressive buying the bounces off of major moving averages. These dips have been buying opportunities the last few years and once support is established we get a series of bullish trend days (long green candles). That means that you can let your trades run longer because you have a strong market trend working in your favor and the stock is likely to keep grinding higher. When the market makes a new high, you can see how the candles compress and the volume drops off. This means you have little to no market tailwind and you need to set passive targets. During the day you should be aware of key support and resistance levels across multiple time frames. 

&#x200B;

**2.** **Relative strength –** Is the stock maintaining its relative strength to the SPY? I compare the stock tick-for-tick with the SPY. If the SPY is up, then I want to see the stock move higher. If the SPY is flat, I want to see the stock move higher. If the SPY is down, I don’t mind if the stock is down a little, but it has to be holding the bid well. If the stock maintains its relative strength, you should stay in the trade as long as the market dip is not organized and as long as market support is intact. If the stock starts to soften on a market dip, it is a sign to take profits. In the chart below you can see how the market was testing support (dips) and how well the stock held up during those periods. This is a sign that you are on the right side of the trade and as soon as the market regains its footing, the stock will shoot higher.

&#x200B;

**3.** **Heavy volume –** Volume tells you that the current move is gaining traction. If the stock is rising on heavy volume you want to ride that move longer than a stock that has normal volume during a rally. You also want to see declining volume when the stock retreats and you do not want large retracements. Small dips with higher lows are a sign that buyers are still engaged.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/drdsuonvzlz71.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f73b4f4858b4152f13bd13e159e69fec82f5af

**4.** **Technical breakouts –** I like to start with a longer term view. If the market is breaking through technical resistance on a daily basis I will be more aggressive with my longs and I will expect a bullish trend day. If a stock is also breaking through technical resistance I will be more aggressive with my longs. I prefer nice clean breaks through that resistance with little to no retracement. Those moves tend to produce nice, orderly price movement and follow through. In the chart below, the stock rallied above the 20-day MA and it also had a bullish flag formation on a daily chart working in its favor.  You will also note that it is in a strong trend on a longer term basis and it was also able to blow through the prior day’s high.

&#x200B;

**5.** **Price action –** This applies to the price action of the market and the price action of the stock. If the market has lots of mixed green and red candles you know the trend strength is weak. If the market has tiny bodied candles it means the current trend is starting to run out of steam. The same holds true for the stock. In the chart below you will notice consecutive long green candles with little to no overlap. This is a sign of incredible trend strength. It is very important to watch for these patterns because they will determine if you should ride the trade longer or if you should take gains. In the case below, you want to hold the stock as long as you can and you should expect a couple of tiny dips along the way (bullish flags). We also want stocks with nice orderly price action. Avoid stocks with random, choppy price action.

If you factor these elements into your exit strategy, you will know when to let the trade run and when to take set passive targets. The market is dynamic and your exit strategy should be as well. 

Trade well.",439,Thanks this is amazingly helpful. I'm going to save it and then forget to read it properly later,This is incredibly helpful and well-put together. To me this is the most helpful post I've read around the topic. Much appreciated!!!,"I have a point of contention with #3. 

Yes a big move on heavy volume, especially a breakout or breakdown, is meaningful. 

However a lot of the time we see a a continuous bullish trend happen on low volume. And what this means is a lack of sellers, in the face of a lot of demand. And this is a very meaningful condition because it means most current owners expect higher prices 

So don't think that moves have to happen on big volume."
Market trends,options,Does heavy volume in options trading increase the likelyhood of fridays moving in the opposite direction of general market trends (explanation inside)?,"I thought about this yesterday at work and was wondering if some of the more knowledgeable guys here could give me their opinion on this idea.

I will explain this theory on the example of a bear market, where general market trend is going down, because it's probably more applicable to the current situation. First I am making three core assumptions which I have no data to back up with but seemed reasonable to me (confirmation needed).

1. Most options **that will be exercised in a bear market** are put options.
2. Most options will get exercised on the last day of their life time (expiration date).
3. Most options expire on a friday.

Now we look at what happens when a put option gets exercised. Again, this is my understanding of it and needs confirmation.

1. The owner of the option is buying the underlying on the market, thus **creating demand and driving the price up**.
2. He then sells the underlying to whoever wrote the option. However, the price was allways set in stone from the moment the option was created and the other party has no choice other than to buy the underlying at said price from the option owner. So this transaction should have **no influence whatsoever on the price of the underlying**.

The result of this is that on fridays there will be increased demand for underlyings of expiring, profitable put options. As we see the volume of options trading increase, as we have in the last couple of months, this effect should become more and more powerful.

The same is true for call options in bull markets, it's just the other way around. I don't think I need to explain that too.",0,"No, because if that were true, you could predict it; if you can make a prediction about the direction (or even just the relative probability of it occurring) you could make an easy profit. If you could make an easy profit, you’d take the money and run; thus, this “Friday options effect” would disappear. 

TLDR: Go Google January effect and look at “criticism” section.",,

Market trends,options,I think I'm done trading options. Here are my opinions. Am I wrong? Civil conversation welcome.,"Over the past twelve years I have traded options off and on. Mostly I have traded defined risk positions and option selling strategies. No naked short options. I think I have gone long options / long volatility perhaps twice in all those years. My account size has been about $10,000 or less. Honestly, I am uncomfortable with risk so my trades have been small.

Some years I have gained $800-$900, other years I've been flat, and this year is my worst year, losing $2,200. I've tried to form opinions on stock and volatility direction through fundamental analysis, technical analysis and just random trade placement, without success. My opinions have generally been wrong.

This last year I have noticed that my broker has made $726.99 from me this year for commissions and fees.

""Where are the customer's yachts?""

One of my worst trades this year was being short $VXX in the midst of some changes they made in the calculation (or something like that). I was assigned shares and experienced a full loss on my spreads. I felt I did not have the deep knowledge of the product or access to information fast enough to prevent this.

I have ruthlessly studied (and have tried to implement) Dan Sheridan's methods, the TastyTrade approach, Option Pit and various other systems.

Here are my propositions that I put here for conversation ... and feel free to correct any one of them. I am open to learning, conversation, and having my opinion changed.

1. Most small retail traders cannot make money specifically in option spread trading.
2. Non-directional spreads (Iron Condors, etc.) in liquid products do not work because the market ""tail risk"" is fatter than a normal distribution would posit.
3. Because of correlation, trading numerous products to supposedly ""spread risk"" is futile because correlations across asset classes generally go to 1 on selloffs.
4. Placing more trades to generate more ""number of occurrences"" is commission intensive.
5. The short term retail trader is at the mercy of noisy market movement created by dealers and other major market participants that they cannot predict.
6. The long term retail trader does not usually have access to the specialized tools, pricy platforms, or deep knowledge that the professionals have to forecast longer term market trends. I am never going to more about the direction of soybeans than a professional commodities trader or analyst will. Because of this knowledge gap, they will make money consistently. I will not.
7. Technical analysis, candlesticks, price patterns, MACDs and RSIs, etc. do not give an edge to the retail trader (even though they are highly touted on retail trading platforms). Most retail indicators are not statistically significant for the end user. Trend lines and areas of ""support"" and ""resistance"" have little predictive value other than being engagement tools for individuals.
8. Short index volatility selling strategies are no longer viable for the retail trader.
9. The broker is the one who consistently makes money in active option trading strategies.
10. I can find no published studies showing retail traders being consistently profitable in option trading, even in the highly touted ""option selling"" and monthly income generating strategies.

I love markets, learning about world economics, how financial bubbles burst and how money moves. I have tried to capitalize on that love by trading options for over a decade. I'm not sure I will ever be able to make money at it. Perhaps I should read books about fantastic traders and listen to podcast interviews of professionals and simply dollar cost average my money each month into the S&P 500. At least with strategy I have made money over the last 25 years and have not paid a broker outrageous sums in commissions.

Am I wrong? Anybody else run into these same issues?

TLDR: I think I'm done trading options. I don't think there is a consistent edge for small retail traders. The brokers are the ones who really make money consistently. I love markets and should stick to books and podcasts about trading, rather than trading myself. I'm open to my opinion being changed.

UPDATE: Thank you for all the responses, advice, commiseration, corrections and, of course, the gentle (and much needed) ass kicking. I have decided to continue options trading, but to just keep it small, enjoy the trading journey, the mental stimulation of market analysis, and the privilege of being a small player in these global markets. I love my day job, so trading is a hobby for me and I'm now OK with it being just that. Thanks, again, to this sub and the mods. I will read all the responses but I probably won't be able to respond to them all. But I appreciate the time everyone has taken / is taking to respond.",221,"I have traded options for over 20 years.  The next option I write will be my first.  I stick to buying puts and calls.  My strategies are simple and boring, but like you I enjoy the markets, etc...

From your post, if you trade options for love of the markets, it seems like you have had a cash neutral hobby over the past 12 years.  That is awesome and I hope you take joy in that!","Well, I've been trading for about 12 years too, off and on. I blew up 4 portfolios, which mind you -- these were my life savings, from low wage work, I sacrificed a lot to save up that money and poof it was gone. Over and over. I contemplated suicide many times -- But! It all changed after I decided to stop gambling and learn to manage risk.

I took it seriously when I lost my job in 2020 and well, decided I would trade a bit to give me some ""cushion"" while I looked for work. I decided to get technical and just trade probabilities. Well, I started off very well -- I'll admit I did made some risky plays at first but they turned out well. I immediately grabbed those earnings and cashed them. This gave me a couple of months of peace of mind. Anyways, I was trading full time (successfully) for about 9 months. Granted, this was a small portfolio (about $10k) and at the time I had low expenses (me and my gf shared a room rental and I was running a very tight budget). I just needed about $900 we each month to not eat into my savings. So every time I'd make $900, I'd cash it and consider the month paid. I was trading mostly vertical credit spreads, 1-0 DTE, near the money. This kept my risk ratio fairly balanced (1:1.5). I stuck to one direction, bullish. So most of my trades were selling Put premium. Long story short, in 2020, I made 110%. But I will admit it was very stressful and I needed to ramp down. Even though I had done well the first 8 months, then I just started breaking even and paying a lot in commissions for nothing. Luckily, I found a good job by then.

In 2021, I ramped down my trading and just focused on work. I would still trade but not low DTE, mostly  swinging vertical Put credit spreads 45 DTE. I made about 35% that year.

This year, I'm up 40% doing basically the same strategy as last year. Once I made the 40% in early December, I stopped trading because I am happy with that number. The past few weeks I've just been paper trading new strategies I want to employ in 2023 (0DTE IC's with stops is so far, at least in paper trades, proven statistically favorable!).

So with all that being said, it's certainly possible to make a profit trading options. Although I'll admit, trading for a living is very stressful. I prefer to keep working and now trade for supplemental income and it's worked out quite well for me. Perhaps you should consider lowering your risk and taking on a different approach, perspective. But don't be so hard on yourself, trading is not an easy game. Perhaps you are not cut out for it. Perhaps you need to try harder, smarter. Whatever you do, good luck to you and stay positive.","> Most small retail traders cannot make money specifically in option spread trading.

False, unless you change ""cannot"" to ""don't"". It's not a matter of whether it is possible or not, it's a matter of the skills/ability/education distribution being skewed below break-even.

There is an equivalent statement about real-money poker players. Most don't make money, but that doesn't mean you can't make money playing poker, and there are several well-known examples of professional poker players who do make money. With option traders, there's not World Series of Option Trading to put faces on the TVs of ever home, so they are not as well known, but they exist.

> Non-directional spreads (Iron Condors, etc.) in liquid products do not work because the market ""tail risk"" is fatter than a normal distribution would posit.

Correct observation, wrong conclusion.

Neutral spreads don't work when you misapply them. That is the much more common reason for the failure of ICs. ICs want range-bound prices during your holding time, and if there are macro reasons for why prices won't be range-bound, is it any surprise that ICs fail?

> Because of correlation, trading numerous products to supposedly ""spread risk"" is futile because correlations across asset classes generally go to 1 on selloffs.

That was certainly true this year, but historically this year was unusual. It might be the start of a new pattern, or it might be a one-off, who knows?

That said, oil/energy, and for a brief time, many other commodities, were moving opposite to the equity and bond markets, so it is still possible to find diversification. But it takes active effort and flexibility of mind to be willing to look for diversification that doesn't fit the traditional textbook pattern of bonds vs. equity.

> Placing more trades to generate more ""number of occurrences"" is commission intensive.

100% true. So what? Even if you are paying $1.30/contract/round-trip, you only need to make $1.30 x quantity to break-even. If you can't do that, you aren't trading right. My average profit *after* fees was around $14/contract on over 600 contracts closed in 2021. That was on $1.00/contract/round-trip fees.

> The short term retail trader is at the mercy of noisy market movement created by dealers and other major market participants that they cannot predict.

While that is certainly a contributing factor, I think it's a bit self-serving shifting-of-responsibility to put **all** the blame on that. How about retail trader mistakes and lack of discipline as a factor? I'd say the impact of the latter is at least 10x more than the former.

I'll add a proposition to your pile that is self-evidently true: **Retail traders will blame all their problems on conspiracies and rigged markets 10x more often than take responsibility for their own trading mistakes.**

> The long term retail trader does not usually have access to the specialized tools, pricy platforms, or deep knowledge that the professionals have to forecast longer term market trends. I am never going to more about the direction of soybeans than a professional commodities trader or analyst will. Because of this knowledge gap, they will make money consistently. I will not.

Again, correct observation, wrong conclusion. Pros have more education, skill and resources, yes, absolutely. So what? By the same reasoning, if you are not a Michelin star chef, don't bother trying to sell food for a living because you won't make money. And yet mom & pop food trucks do just fine. It's a matter of scale, not of capability.

Most retail indicators are not statistically significant for the end user.

Finally, an argument I can 100% agree with without qualification.

But again, is this the fault of the tool or the tool wielder? If you go in thinking that statistical measures that are based on *looking at the rearview mirror* are going to tell you what's over the next hill, that's on you for being a bad driver, not on the rearview mirror. It did it's job.

> Short index volatility selling strategies are no longer viable for the retail trader.

Well, if you are only considering this year, I can understand why you might say that. And there is even a chance that it is a true statement going forward. But I hope not. It certainly *wasn't* true before 2020.

> The broker is the one who consistently makes money in active option trading strategies.

Well, I wouldn't say the *only* one, but of course, the casino owner makes money no matter who wins or loses at the gaming tables. That's not new information and that's not an indictment of retail trading. It's the cost of doing business. Do you blame the country club for making money on your annual membership fee when you can't break par?

> I can find no published studies showing retail traders being consistently profitable in option trading, even in the highly touted ""option selling"" and monthly income generating strategies.

This is just a restatement of your first proposition.

Market trends,options,"QQQ has broken the 50 SMA, back in bullish territory? Looking at beaten names: TSLA, SQ, CRWD, PYPL","What a strong finish to the week while most tech & growth names followed through above their 50-day simple moving average (SMA), circled in orange.

https://preview.redd.it/l6cxg36x0qz91.png?width=2562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f039a5fa9ef395ee94087c8b1d7b63115158b8d

Trends aren’t guaranteed indicators, but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks. Since this is a mid-range trend indicator, it may be somewhat more sustainable than looking at the 10 or 20-day moving average (shorter time-frames and more volatile trends).

We are heading toward an interesting area to watch and finally trucking closer to breaking the 200-day moving average, a long-term trend. Most investors use the 200-day as a macro trend-line.

Below 200 SMA = bearish trend

Above 200 SMA = bullish trend

Of course, these can change just as fast, but we haven’t been above the 50-day since August and above the 200-day moving average since April, where we briefly pierced it, and then quickly continued back down. Technical indicators are usually viewed as zones of support and resistance where the 200-SMA is the last stand in either direction.

But something else changed on Thursday/Friday as well. Net options sentiment in single names skyrocketed to the upside (and with good reason). Let's take a look, data/screenshots from [Prospero.AI](https://www.prospero.ai/), an options analytics platform.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

If options continue on the bullish side I wouldn’t be surprised to finish the year with a small rally in the indices with more aggressive rally in singular names. More likely than not it will be the growth names that have been battered, but are still looking good on fundamentals.",244,Until the fed puts an end to it.,"Sure.  Its bullish, for now.","I hate the moving average as a ""technical indicator"" not just because it's a lagging indicator. But because when you say:  
""Trends aren’t guaranteed indicators, but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks""  
I can paraphrase that by saying:  
""if a stock goes up, that doesn't mean it will keep going up. But if it keeps going up its a good thing""  


yeah, no shit."

I feel like it's close to impossible depending on your situation. I work full time in construction and enrolled in University. I go 50 hours / week working and another 15 on school. The only time I was able to learn about options and investing, aside from previous knowledge, was during early covid where everything was shut down. At the time I was an essential employee so I only had about 3 weeks off before i was called back into work. I understood it enough to make decent gains for a small account. Now I have no time to follow market trends while working. Even if I set alerts, making any moves won't work when I'm working with or around heavy equipment.

All those bathroom breaks are just to check my account.,"I work from home so it’s a bit easier but I did come up with some things that helped.  Until COVID it involved quite a bit of travel as well.

Market trends,options,Daytrading options. My tips,"I thought I would share a few of the lessons I have learned over the last 18 months of day trading options for fun. I started with about 14k which I grew to about 22k before hitting a low earlier this year of about 2k. 

What happened….  I was gambling on trades, purely guessing about what would happen, fighting strong trends trying to time the market, not cutting trades early if they went against me. I’m currently at $4200. Once I hit 2k I decided I need to get serious about figuring this thing out or give it up all together. I have slowly and consistently been hitting base hits day trading Spy for the past 2 months. I might only make $50 a day but I have done this consistently.    These are tips are things that Ive picked up from a variety of sources over my Time trading. Over the past month I have used these tips to limit losses and have very consistent green trading days. Your mileage may vary. Only time will tell if I will be profitable long term but I feel these tips are food for thought either way. 

In no particular order

Try to never let a green trade go red. If you aren’t sure if a trade will continue to go green,  you are always better in the long run to sell and watch from the side lines. +5% is ALWAYS better than -5%. Think base hits not home runs . 

One of the most critical. ALWAYS  scale out. If a trade has momentum in my favor, I will always scale out about 2/3 of the trade at 20% profit. If I’m concerned about the momentum I may scale earlier but I ALWAYS scale at 20%. If I have $300 invested and the trade is up 20% ($360 total). I’ll sell 2/3 and leave ~$120 in. That leaves me upside potential but protects my money on the downside. This has saved me so much anxiety and helps me to be consistent on the upside. 

Remember, the key to making money long term in the stock market is to protect your money. Limit risk, scale out, limiting “gambling” 

Focus on one thing. I trade Spy options. Learn one stock and learn how it reacts. How it moves. 

When it comes to Spy options. I only trade weeklies. Lower profit than 0DTE but if I’m wrong, and I will be wrong, I limit my risk and leave myself time to sell a bad trade. 

Learn to watch for trends. Enter a trade with a plan. If the stock goes against you, your plan was wrong. Sell and move on. Screw your ego…PROTECT YOUR MONEY. 

I have a small account so I limit my trades to 10% at a time. Higher than what most recommend but needed with a small account

Specific to SPY,  I have a stock group with the top ten stocks that make up SPY. This can help me recognize trends. Is one stock skyrocketing causing Spy to move or is it a trend across a wide range? 

Use a cash account if you trade with less than $25k. You avoid PDT and options settle the next day. This will allow you to focus on the trade itself and to quickly sell if you are wrong without worrying about PDT rules. 

I’ll add others but these have been the bedrock of my recent success. Let me know if you have any good ones.",116,I love trading wklys. You hit the nail on the head. Risk management is key to winning,"So, you turned 14k into 4k, and you're giving out tips, huh? Welcome","About you following the top 10 of spy, there's an indicator/strategy that tries to incorporate this idea on Tradingview called ""top 40 high low"".

P.s. I didn't make this, just thought it relevant."

I just realized the first full [senator insider trading report](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1388963844685324288?s=20)

- Senators traded a lot, followed trends earlier
- Outperformed market
- See trades by Feinstein, Loeffler, Roberts and more
- Senators got wealthier in 2020-21 with lots of unusual trading",376,They should not be allowed to invest in individual companies while in office.

Economic indicators,options,"Expected moves this week: FOMC Minutes, Zoom, Nvidia and more.","Stocks had another stong week, finishing higher by about 2.3% Both SPX and SPY got stuck in the mud for the final 3 days of last week as they reached a heavy open interest level of 450/4500 and the gamma took effect, essentially pinning the indices to that level as November monthly options approached expiry. With those monthly options expired the backdrop changes into this week, but it also happens to be a shortened Thanksgiving week. Therefore, options are pricing a small move, a bit less than 1% into Friday. It's possible that gamma get re-established at the same level but it is unlikely we see that sort of gamma pinning we saw last week as the effect won't be as robust to start a new option calendar month.

The big economic data of the week comes on Tuesday with the release of the FOMC minutes. Fed watchers' attention turns now from rate hikes, with the assumption those are now over, to any signs of cracks in the economy which could allow the FOMC to begin cutting rates in 2024. As of now Fed fund futures give a small chance of a rate cut by March with a strong chance of one happening by May. That's something to keep an eye on as talk of rate cuts would likely coincide with worries about an economic cooldown. That table has not turned yet but it could become the focus into year end.

Been scalping it on the way up. Planning a strangle & straddle on it pre earnings"
Economic indicators,options,What is going on with the equity market? I am losing my rationality,"\*\*Hi!\*\*

First off sorry for the vague title. I don't know if this fits here but I decided to take that risk.

Student here, working part time at an institutional asset manager (and not a native english speaker). I seem to be confused with the current market behaviour as it defies everything I've learned so far.

I would really appreciate if anyone could beat some sense into me and educate me as to why I shouldn't heavily short equities right now.

To start let me summarize the current situation (note that the selected information will be biased by me, even if it's not conciously). I will mainly focus on the S&P 500 (SPX/\^GSPC) for simplicity and structure it like this:

\------------------

1. Index Price and Analyst Expectations
2. Indicators and Benchmarks
3. Economic Numbers, Trends, News and Sentiment

The rant is happening in part 3 mostly.

\-------------------

**1a) Analysts Targets**

During this week, I heard about 10 Analysts from Banks and Asset Managers (GM,JPM,CS,UBS, some hedge funds) say that they expect the S&P to have an upside-potential to 4'200. The expected EOY-Median is also 4'200, though the Expectation for EOY 2021 was only 3'950-4'000 at the beginning of this year.

[Short Term Boundaries](https://preview.redd.it/mlsq39aty7s61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=6295d87dcd09754d485859911044a7aff69e233b)

It seems kind of weird to me how we almost already touched that 4'200 upper limit. Even weirder how every single analyst had the same target for the S&P 500 and every single one said ""we remain bullish on US equities"". Their explanations haven't really convinced me as none of them could really answer the shows hosts on the question why they remain bullish even though we're up that far already.

We hit ATH 20 times this year, with 5 of them having happened in the last 10 business days.

[ATHs marked red \(SPX Closing Prices\)](https://preview.redd.it/agihumz308s61.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=d395b22896c7268af8b992fe33131abe168eb123)

With earnings ahead, I don't get how this should be going even further up. Especially on the news we're facing (see further down part 3).

\--------------

**1b) Volume and VIX**

* *Trading volume can signal when an investor should take profits and sell a security due to low activity. (Investopedia)*
* *In the U.S. stock market and many other developed financial markets, about 70-80 percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading.*
* *The algos provide great liquidity when there is no news, but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize.*

Hmm okay. We had 70 business days so far in 2021 and out of the last 10 there are 7 days in the top 10 lowest daily trading volume (YTD, since 01-01-2021). If we're supposedly in 'bullish' situation, why is the volume going down so rapidly and the trading so frothy? Are the algos idling to meet the ESG-benchmarks or?

We're also at the lowest VIX-Level on the 1Y-Chart which I learned is usually a sell signal (shortterm).

\-----------

**1c) Psychological Factors (SideNote)**

April has been the best performing month for US equities for the last two decades. April was performing net-positive in 14 out of the last 15 years (excluding 2008).

The best performing equities in april are historically european stocks, followed by US stocks.

Knowing that this month started at 3'992 (ATH) I'm having doubts that the trend will repeat this time though.

\-----------

**2) Technicals**

**2a) MA, MACD**

I'm kind of a believer in the theory that most technical indicators only work because actual systems and people trade by their principles. Having said that it's obviously kind of misleading to use momentum indicators as all of them are giving us strong buy signals even at ATH levels:

[Barchart Indicators with their buy signals](https://preview.redd.it/k5lvh37598s61.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=848bda20c938189d32330efacc0f541b9a6e3966)

Just to note; we're obviously above moving averages at this point:

https://preview.redd.it/29jhp1lw67s61.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=e70aa871fda3be5ae205e7ff3c4394caf04c7a96

\-----------------

**2b) RSI, PE Ratio**

It's really difficult for me to evaluate the usefulness of value-based indicators like the buffet-indicator or the PE ratio. They ignore the decrease in interest rates and the influx of retail money into equities:

https://preview.redd.it/3mos6wyua8s61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b84ca31be9228a0323466b8ed100ba128c84eb2

Without that in mind the stock-market values would look pretty wild at this point;

https://preview.redd.it/8rpsg5sxa8s61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=0168296221bc823428333316d199a642673617a4

**2b) PE Ratio**

The same logic applies to price-to-earnings ratios;

[Shiller\/CAPE PE Ratio for the SPX](https://preview.redd.it/k0hvjwu8v7s61.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=c150c0401983a4a3dbe5adea4fed9d6278f4d1a3)

Still ... what bothers me is that the PE ratios of US indices are so much higher than the rest of the world:

[Shiller\/Cape PE Ratio major equitiy indices](https://preview.redd.it/rfv5c7cmb8s61.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c83b816aad561bfa70412fde2c510fd38f9b2e6)

The worst one is not even listed here - the current ratio of the NDX (Nasdaq 100) lies at 50.19!

It's as if investors don't expect any growth outside of US companies or am I interpreting that wrong? It's not like inflation is higher in the US either (though there is a certain depreciation in the USD).

And if the earnings so obviously don't matter (anymore), how can analysts like this guy from Credit Suisse say that the prices are soaring due to the strong earnings??? (Src; Bloomberg-Link)

And lastly I understand the 21day-RSI crossing 70+ as a sell signal or is that wrong again?

[SPX 21D-RSI on lower chart with BS-boundaries on upper chart](https://preview.redd.it/jw1afsttf8s61.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3b064f7305badc6f472550b1bca4fcdbd2af4d4)

\----------------

**3) Economic Data, Trends, News, Sentiments**

Oh god here we go. I will not provide as much details and pictures so let me summarize the most important points IMO a bit:

3a) Job Market

|Date|Actual|Expected|
|:-|:-|:-|
|25-mar 21|684|730|
|01-apr 21|719|680|
|08-apr 21|744|680|

* The weekly jobless-claims reached a pandemic-era low **2 weeks ago** (25-mar) which resulted in the index going up 50bp.
* **Last week** we had larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 50bp.
* **This week** we had way larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 30bp.

It's weird how these numbers were celebrated and being sold as the reason for rising equity prices with one reason being that the FED seemingly only talks about the job numbers as their motivation for propping up the economy.

Now that the numbers went bad they suddenly do not matter anymore. It actually pissed me off how Tom Keene saw these numbers on Bloomberg TV and said ""if we're being honest, how much do these numbers matter anyway? They are just transitory""... like ... why did you care about them before then?

\-------------

**3b) Inflation and Yields (fixed income)**

You guys probably kept an eye on the treasury yields too as they seem to have caused a small taper tantrum in the first days of march. Analysts expect the 10Y US Tr. Yield to reach about 2% this year. As the treasuries usually act as benchmark for other assets, mortgage interest rates and bond rates have spiked as well.

This SHOULD be bad for high-risk assets (also as in high debt-ratios) short- to mid-term like overvalued stocks as found in the Nasdaq/SPX-Components. News Outlets were talking for WEEKS about the reflation trade and the shift from growth to value stocks. There were theories about quant funds shifting big time etc. ... as it stands we're kind of back with our major growth indices though?

&#x200B;

[YTD: NDX and SPX above and 10Y Tr. Yield below](https://preview.redd.it/yacawd7lk8s61.png?width=2445&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2319e7c5f82606dc45f8bc1a75d0ea16aa616cd)

It's not like the treasury yields have retreated much, but for some reason the major tech stocks all jumped 5% to 15% this week... and they're saying that financial corps will do the same next week.

The PPI data released today only indicates even higher inflation expectations - same in other countries like china (4.4% actual):

[US PPI Month over Month](https://preview.redd.it/sqtuneq3l8s61.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c96357955faaa0d961310503d5f6e525afdcc30)

I get that higher yields are good for the financial sector and that a depreciation in the USD drives US equities as well (and inflation in US = USD loses value c.p.). But I still don't see why tech jumped.

\------------

**3c) Risk in the financial sector**

With low yields (well until recently) the leverage ratio increased substantially and even the FEDs balance sheet kind of imploded due to the pandemic. There is so much money in the market and so much leverage just so guaranteed rates can be delivered ... I wonder how this is not a sign of risk to anyone?

We just had the bust of a fund with Archegos that erased about USD 194 billion of market value and a similar picture with Greensill capital or the supposed short-sellers of equities in january. Even after this, Credit Suisse somehow thinks that they have proper risk management lol. And I wish I wouldn't have to say that about one of our 'national' banks ... sigh. Oh and somehow Citibank just lost 500M in some transactions... woops?

\-----------

**3d) Tax revolution**

The current projects on better international tax collaboration, higher corporate and individual taxes, a minimum tax rate for companies etc.... all of this sounds like bad news for companies... but somehow it get's ignored??? Someone help me on this please.

\----------

**3e) Vaccination Progress**

At the current rate, we will achieve global herd immunity in 2022 with cases rising again in Europe and developing/industrial countries.

[Low progress in less wealthy countries](https://preview.redd.it/66dpywwxm8s61.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=30d9738c543ff9d2832fcb6a297c8b7377b1eec4)

It seems like the lagging progress outside of the US doesn't concern the market in the least as we can see with ATHs on european and asian indices. I guess Tom Keene would say that these numbers are irrelevant anyway.

\-----------

**3f) Chip Shortage**

Major car manufacturers halted production (GM, Ford) this week and many tech products can't meet demand due to the delay in production (like the current MacBooks). It's a consensus that this issue will stay for a few years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few years.

https://preview.redd.it/w4orw8mfn8s61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=1527fc2582fd5a703ba239cf9f104215c0c5abcf

This is pretty bad news, right? Obviously this means that the market has to go up... like ... I don't understand. This is an obvious issue but somehow these stocks just go up ...

\---------------

There are many other bad news like the Ukraine conflict (where talks about a possible war exist) or the Oil price dilemma and uncertain future of crypto currencies. But I'm leaving it at this right now.

\---------------

Lastly I want to note my personal destain for Bloomberg News as they seem to be publishing some weird articles lately. There are major news but they kind of spin it into 'good news' and (for example) talk about the potential of SPX hitting 4'100+ this week instead. I mostly resorted to Reuters and selected smaller outlets last week for this reason.

\---------------

Ok guys, that's it. I would be happy to have someone explain me why I should be 'bullish' on the SPX. I just loaded up on puts (structured products) after losing most of my portfolio this week on rather heavily leveraged puts.

Thanks to anyone for reading this.

Economic indicators,options,"Expected moves this week: VERY low IV in SPY/SPX, earnings from Salesforce, Crowdstrike and more.","SPY/SPX was higher by about 1% in holiday-shortened trading last week, slightly more than what options were pricing. The gamma we've discussed in these posts that held SPX near the 4500 level mostly expired after Nov monthly expiration the week before but the Thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop we'll see over the next few weeks. If we were to see some volatility before year end it would most likely come in the next two weeks while the gamma forces are not as significant, and, there's a decent amount of economic data and Fedspeak.

Implied Vol is VERY low across the board. The VIX closed Friday near 12.50. At the money IV in SPY/SPX is below 10 for several days this week. The VIX has been a straight line down from 22 in late October. As discussed previously that can have a self-fulfilling crush on both implied vol AND realized vol, loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium. Those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow. The conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating sell-off in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again. Whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen. If it does not we then re-enter a holiday period at year-end and a December expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma. Before now and then there are this week's GDP, PCE and a Powell Speech. Next week is an important Jobs Number, and after that is CPI. So some things to watch for on the calendar.

Earnings season is coming to an end but some interesting names remain. This week sees Crowdstrike, Salesforce, Snowflake and a few others.

Economic indicators,options,Beginning Indicators," 

Trading involves technical analysis, reading the charts and what each candlestick means and the shapes and indicators involved. One of my favorite and very useful tools for charting not on the brokerage platform is tradingview. Tradingview has A LOT of resources, from livestream trading, cryptocurrency, and new ideas to look at, there’s a lot I haven’t explored that can entertain any trader. So here I just wanted to provide some of the indicators that can help initial readings and possibly go into more complex indicators:

RSI (Relative Strength Index): Relative Strength Index measures whether a stock is being overbought or oversold. Lower RSI indicates people have sold more and that you could be looking for an increase in buying. Two points to watch are when RSI is close to 70, meaning it’s moving towards overbought, and 30, meaning it’s oversold.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence): MACD helps show the price movement, moving average on a shorter period versus a longer period. Tradingview shows a shorter exponential moving average as blue with the signal line, the longer exponential moving average, as red. The short EMA will always meet the long EMA but it helps determine possible uptrends or downtrends when the blue line crosses the red line. Crossing downward is bearish and upward is the opposite. MACD can contain gold and death crosses. Gold Cross has the blue line shoot up through the red line, creating a cross and a bullish indicator. Death Cross has the blue line drop through the red line, a bearish signal.

MFI (Money Flow Index): Money Flow Index is similar to RSI in that it can also help determine overbought or oversold areas with usual indicators at 80 and 20, similar indications to RSI. Using MFI with RSI can help spot divergences. If RSI and the stock go up, but MFI is down, this can signal a reversal in price.

ADL (Advance/Decline Line): ADL helps determine the amount of shares being bought or sold, a positive number showing more bullish indication and negative showing bearish. Spikes in ADL can show possible artificial breakout without justification in price movement. A great example below, we see a spike in ADL but not much of an increase in price, so shows possible fake breakout and artificial increase in truly advancing stocks.

Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands help identify when a stock might be trading outside their price range. Bollinger Bands are usually set at 2 standard deviations away from the price, as statistically, 2stdev is considered an outlier. This can help identify a breakout from its trading range or retest the Bollinger Bands and come back inside it’s range.

VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price): “If Volume is king, VWAP is queen” VWAP, recommended by shorter time frames, is the average price the stock is trading at, taking volume into account. If a stock is trading above VWAP, you can most likely expect it to come down to the average price, tending towards equilibrium as economics rule #1. Overall, it’s important to use multiple indicators as they can tell different stories, and using them on multiple timelines can also help you determine what the short term and long term prospects.",34,I love VWAP for day trading,"I use ADX and Bollinger Bands, among others, in my scanning criteria, but my charts are clean. When I first started trading, the candles were hidden behind all sorts of squiggles and when they didn't work, it was confusing. Now, my charts are devoid of any indicators and I rely on price action alone, and that includes not utilizing  candlestick patterns.","Its important to learn price action as indicators are lagging and can be self fulfilling. Also do not stack the same type of indicators and think it means multiple buy signals. I see this alot people will use rsi and skd thinking because they line up it means signals when in truth you are just looking at two indicators that mimic one another as they are the same type. It would help to explain there are different types of indicators and combination of different types of indicators gives better signals. But price action is still king, if you really wanna be a winner you need to be an expert at it."
Economic indicators,options,"Expected moves this week. SPY, QQQ, AMD, Starbucks, Roku, Draftkings and more","## Market View

**Last Week –** SPY rose 3.9% last week, despite disappointing earnings (and gaps lower) in big cap tech names like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, (Apple’s 7.5% move higher, bucked the trend and helped close the week on a high note). That SPY move higher followed a 5% rally the week before. It is now about 10% above the recent lows. QQQ was up about 2.2% on the week, underperforming the broader market and weighed down by those earnings reports. QQQ is now about 8% higher than its recent lows. The Dow is about 14% higher.

Volatility fell across the board, with the VIX now below 26, both because of the move higher but also with a huge percentage of the SPX market cap now having reported.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 26, its lowest levels since mid September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.

The economic calendar this week features both the FOMC, where a 0.75 rate increase is expected, and the NFP jobs number to round out the week.

stock,options,Best Covered Call Stocks,"I see a few others here are trading CCs. Who has some good ideas for CC candidates right now? Let's share some ideas with the numbers.

I trade well-known companies with low stock prices and relatively low margin requirements. I look for stocks where the bid for the weekly option is 1% or more of the current stock price.

As always, stocks and options involve risk and CCs are no different and this is not advice, just discussion.

Right now, X is trading at $28.66. The margin requirement (Etrade) is 35%. 100 shares would require about $1000 in capital. The $29.00 call expiring on 6/18 has a bid of .97. This is almost a 10% return instantly and another 3% or so if it assigns. The caveat here is that this is a near term high level for X and may come down. I would caution against a large position here, but X always pays a relatively good premium if you wait for it to come back down a bit from here.

AA is another one of my regular CCs. It is trading at $37.36. The margin requirement is also 35%, meaning a 100 shares would require capital of about $1300. The $37.50 call has a bid of .88. This is around a 6.5% return and another 1% if it assigns. Even though it pays a little less than X, this price level is less elevated than X right now.

I know these returns sound like nothing compared to WSB short squeezes, but these are weekly returns and they add up quick. I usually have 2000-3000 shares of X in my portfolio and regularly collect $1000-$2500 in premium and extra when it assigns. I use it to pay for some options and shares in WSB stocks like WKHS. 

I think it is important to have an income strategy as well as a capital gains strategy. Use your income strategy to pay for the more speculative plays, it hurts less if they don't work out!",367,"I like CC, but I think selling PUTS would still be a better play. If you get assigned, then you can do CC, collect premiums both way","I own 3400 shares of AHT at $5.23. I sold 34 covered calls for July 16 at $10 strike. That’s $4,000 premium, and max profit of $20,000 if it hits my strike price. I plan on holding share for a very long time.","I wheel 2000 shares of X, cost basis 25 USD, will be called away this Friday at 28 USD."

This article has a lot of implications for options and not just 'meme' stocks. Basically, this is saying all options are potentially manipulated. It has sent a chill down my spine about options in general. I've made some good money in options but also lost a lot too and more recently. 

How many times have I seen a stock trending upward and suddenly reverse course only to end up finishing the week right on top of max pain. 

How many times must I see OBV barely move and yet a stock is tanking. 

I will watch level 2 and see the bid filled with way more orders than the ask and yet the stock is tanking. 

I feel like I'm staring into the void trying to decide if this whole thing is worth it anymore.

trade,options,Does anyone only swing trade spy?,"I’m starting to shift my focus of finding good setups throughout the market to just mainly focusing on spy. I’m thinking this because you don’t have to worry about earnings dates or anything, tight spreads on the options chain and that spy will always go up as long as you have the time and there’s no major reasons for a crash. I was just wondering if anyone else takes this approach to mainly just swing/day trading spy and if not what are your go to stocks to trade?",819,I trade spy options exclusively,I’ve been totally thinking about this and very curious to see the replies.,"Spy trading is harder than trading other securities with earnings dates etc.

The reason is exactly that: SPY has no events so thus when you make a poor trade, say you buy a long option for too much or sell a short option for too little, these events can right-size for you through IV changes. This doesn't happen with SPY.

I am not saying don't do it but don't think it's the silver bullet to avoiding these issues. It isn't. It's almost a catalyst for the inverse; it's a far more stable roller coaster but with far less opportunity for when you're wrong to work out in your favor."
trade,options,The Genius Behind Nany Pelosi's Trades,"One of the greatest traders of our time - Nancy Pelosi. Joking aside, I was looking through her recent trades and couldn't help but notice how well structured they are. Her choices for the longs are very similar to how I set up my diagonals.

* She's using long calls as a surrogate long stock position to take advantage of the leverage afforded by options. For example, the GOOG trade cost around $940K for her to put on. A similar stock trade would've been around $2.9MM.
* She uses two different long call strategies, based on her disposition towards the stock.
   * For more developed equities like GOOG, MU, DIS, she selected slightly shorter term expirations but went further ITM. This allows the trade to behave more like long stock while decreasing the impact of theta decay on the options.
   * For more growth oriented equities like RBLX and CRM, she selected LEAP expirations and chose strikes closer to the money (although, still ITM). This offers more growth opportunity in the options if directionally correct, while still limiting the impact of theta decay on the longs.
* She selected all established products with promising lines of business going forward. DIS surprised me a little bit, but since COVID they've been pivoting more and more to telecomm so I can understand her thought process the.
* The choices she made are not the cheapest method to gain exposure, however, these are well structured trades. Diamond hands Pelosi at it again.

EDITS for all the keyboard warriors:  
\-I'm not suggesting that Pelosi is actually any kind of great trader - the post is generally satire. The focus is more on the construction of the trades.  
\-The post isn't about how she selects the products, if there's insider trading, etc.   
\-To clarify, Nancy's husband makes most of the trades and she is required to report them. I have absolutely no idea who is actually structuring the trades, if they have an advisor, etc. Again, calling her the great trader is more of a joke than anything.

trade,options,Quit trading,"Hello whoever took the time to read this. I don’t really know how to start this, but  whatever I just really need to vent and have someone listen. 
I was slapped with the hand of reality yesterday after a fight with my girlfriend. She’s felt that since I’ve started trading which was a little over a year and a half ago, I’ve become less patient & irritable. Ultimately being the reason why our relationship has been falling apart. 

I’m the type of person that when I get really into something, I try to be the very best at whatever it is. Thus this is the mindset that I took when learning the ins and outs of trading options. 
Like most, I started out on Robinhood, and as I felt more comfortable I opened an account with TD Ameritrade. I started with around a thousand dollars which coming for me is a kind of a stretch for me at the time.

Fast forward I became absorbed by the markets & trading. On the weekends I researched and planned plays for the week & I couldn’t wait for Monday to get back in there and trade. I love trading, it excites me it’s fun, it makes me feel like I’m doing something with my life. However, the emotions that came with it seemed to take a toll on me & my relationship. The losses would  impact the mood for the rest of my day, I would just be really upset at myself for  not being smarter. She would constantly support me day in and day out, (not financially, but emotionally) 
I would take time off to get my head straight and then give it another go.

Nonetheless, history repeats itself & nothing changed. I’d still get upset with myself over the losses & would start to sell some of my personals to make enough to keep trading. I know I’ll probably get shit for having a gambling addiction, I just would have the mindset of not quitting, and not giving up. Not wanting to become a failure... 

All said & done, she finally told me that giving up trading all together was just not for me, & i just feel useless. Aside from working my shity job, I don’t have anything that I can put my mind and energy into that makes me feel productive, and good, like I’m working towards something. 

Tomorrow is Monday & im dreading it because my mornings from now till God knows when are just meh. 

Thanks for reading.

Since you've got a TD account already, download thinkorswim and toggle it to paper trading. Then stick your real money in an index ETF and paper trade for a year and compare the two.

That way you can get the experience of trading options without paying the tution of learning by failing so to speak from your savings.  Just don't set your paper trade account to start with some insane amount of money. Trade it like it's your real capital otherwise there is no point. 

Also see if you can put the same effort into a new certification or something to transition to a job you like more and pays more.

trade,options,Don’t Trade Options,"If you don’t have a written plan. The goal of this post is to share personal mistakes in my early trading to hopefully encourage others down a different path. 

People tend to hate those kind of statements because it makes us feel inadequate and that we’re doing something wrong. However, I can unequivocally say, transitioning from trading off the dome to writing a plan is massive and probably one of the largest changes to my trading success. 

I started trading in high school, so I scoffed at the idea of having to write things out. I figured I could just look at my logs, adjust based on what I saw, and do just fine. Looking back 16 years, I want to slap my cocky naive self. 

Options are incredibly complex products. And millions of people try their hand at it and we know the majority fail. The arrogance I had, thinking that as late teen, early 20 year old I would just be able to successfully deploy without a written plan or log is literally wild. 

If the idea sounds like work and annoying to do - you’re spot fucking on. AS IT SHOULD BE. Just because the barrier to enter into trading is SO LOW, don’t allow that to lull you into a false sense of security. 

The real benefit of a trading plan isn’t using the finished plan as a reference, although it is a good one. The benefit comes from the rigor put into creating one and the exercise itself. Similar to when I was giving a 5 paragraph order as a Marine Officer - I very rarely would crack open my plan to remind myself what to do in a scenario. I didn’t need to because I knew it cold from building and delivering the plan. Same exact goes for trading. 

If you have a plan or pieces of one and want some feedback, post it here and let’s have a constructive dialogue about them. If you don’t have one, below is a simple outline to get you started. 

1. Orientation. What is the goal of your trading? This should be quantified. We should also force ourself to answer: Is my goal realistic? WHY do I think it is? How can I track whether it is or not?

2. Portfolio deployment. How do you intend to use your portfolio, manage risk, assess markets, etc. 

3. Tools. This can be everything from notes, TA/FA tools, chart setups, market functions, etc. 

4. Strategy Outlines. This breaks the strategy down into a full lifecycle, in depth. What’s the idea of the strat? How does it make money? How does it lose? How do you manage PnL? How does that affect expectancy? What deltas do you use? Why? How do you scale?

5. Tracking. This is where we track and quantify our ideas, questions, and assumptions. This enables unbiased analysis and optimization. 

6. Audits. I’m a firm believer in having people I respect look over my work to poke holes, identify gaps, confirm rigor. 

Yes it’s work. Yes it’s worth it. This is how I’ve maintained a 20% CAGR for over 15 years.


EDIT: It seems we need to add context, because many have a broken sense of market potential. 

>I see “20% would make him one of the best money managers” or “there’s no way someone can make that return” or “you did that during a bull market, who cares”

-This mindset simply gives ourselves an “out” on our own performance and is a lazy way to excuse ourselves from actually trying to get better. 

-If we chalk something up to luck, chance, or throw it away as impossible, there’s no imperative for us to look more closely at ourselves. 

-Moreover, you’ll find that fund managers are the wrong benchmark to compare good performance against. They tend to underperform for many reasons. 

-I highly encourage you to monitor the results of the US Investing Championship. I have for years. I am a solid, consistent trader and am proud of my performance but this will give you a much better idea of what “really good” looks like. 

-To elucidate the point, let’s take a look at 2023 YTD USIC performance:

    a. Stock division: 121.8%, 90.7%, 89.2%
    b. Enhanced growth (derivatives): 182.7%, 65%, 38.2%

I hope people take the time to do research on what’s possible, what’s likely, etc. I couldn’t care less what people think about my performance, but I’m hoping to open people’s minds to using real information to create their perception of possibility vs repeating what they’ve heard somewhere.",95,"""I started trading in high school""

Seeing as statistically over 90% of traders don’t make money, people either need to try strategies with very lows amounts of money to Minimize risk, not focusing on $ gain but % of success and/or find something that highly reduces risk. 

Gains are gains. Don’t have FOMO, don’t chase, don’t get emotional. Until you know what you’re doing, trade with an amount you’d be able to deal with losing 100% of. Easier to lose and learn off 50% of $100 than 50% of $1,000. In the end, you’re learning your strategy just the same. Learned this the hard way early on"
trade,options,I analyzed all the controversial trades made by Senators in the 2020 Congressional insider trading scandal. Here are the results!,"**Preamble:**  The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. There have been multiple stories covering the 2020 congressional [insider trading scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) where Congress Members allegedly used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash. But none of the articles talked about the financial implications of those trades and whether the retail investors could have front-run the market using the disclosed data.  Basically, what I wanted to know was

**How much did the Senators save by offloading their positions before the crash and could I have done the same?**

**Where is the data from**: efdsearch.senate.gov

For my [previous analysis into congressional trading](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/copy-top-stocks-of-the-week-614493), I used data from senatestockwatcher.com. But not all the transactions are captured on the website and I wanted to match exactly with the trades reported by famous journals. efdsearch.senate.gov is the United States official website where Senator, former Senator, and candidate financial disclosure reports are available. Some of the data is available as a scanned file and some in normal HTML format. I had to manually transcribe most of the data used in this analysis.

In case you are wondering about the time delay between the actual transaction and reporting, Congress Members are expected to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/). The median delay in reporting that I observed for all the trades was 28 days.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

There are multiple factors at play here.

Timeline: On January 24, 2020, the Senate Committees on Health and Foreign Relations held a closed meeting with only Senators present to brief them about the COVID-19 outbreak and how it would affect the United States. I am considering this as the start time for my analysis. Any sale made by the senators after this point up to Feb 26 is considered. (I did not consider sales beyond that point as SPY dropped 8% during that week. My assumption here is it’s realistic for any person be it a normal investor or a Senator to panic sell after seeing that drop). For reference, SPY dropped an additional 25% over the next 3 weeks!  

Senators under consideration: I have considered trades done by 4 senators in my analysis. I have focused on these 4 as all of them were investigated by [Justice Department and the FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) following the trading scandal.

1. Richard Burr
2. Kelly Loeffler
3. James M Inhofe
4. David A Perdue

https://preview.redd.it/x2tks1zpv1371.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=7630f748040d062eb6cff81bde8c07de2497b2bb

David Perdue sold 44 times ($3.49 MM) in the 33 days following the closed senate meeting. Interestingly James Inhofe only transacted 8 times but the combined value of shares he sold was a whopping $4.12MM. The most ironic part is that Richard Burr who was under investigation the longest and had to step down from the intelligence committee due to the scandal had the least dollar volume in the transaction ($1.1MM).

**Results:**

Before we dive into the overall amount saved by the Senators and the retail investor side of the analysis, let’s see what were the best trades made by the Senators during that time period.  

https://preview.redd.it/c5u292rqv1371.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9f526cb3c4bc68ced13f07c1fd1eddd86021d9

David Perdue absolutely killed it with his stock plays. He is present 7 times in the top 10 list and his best play, Caesars Entertainment reduced 83% after he sold his position. Fun Fact: if a stock reduces 83%, it has to go up 488% just to reach back to its initial price. Another interesting observation from the chart is that senators mainly sold stocks related to the entertainment and hospitality industries which were the most severely affected industries due to the pandemic.

https://preview.redd.it/arf7c6bvv1371.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=d14f4082ae081911ce365331d82a6845278499d2

The above chart showcases the amount of money saved by the Senators due to front running the market crash. David Perdue saved an insane $2.2MM with his stock sales. I also kept a multiple of annual Senate salary to showcase the scale of impact they made to their portfolio because of the trades.

Finally, we come to the million-dollar question. **Was it possible for the retail investors to follow these trades and front-run the crash?**

This is where the analysis gets a bit tricky. 88% of the transactions were reported by March 3rd but if you consider it in dollar values, only 52% of the transactions were reported (some of the high-value transactions were reported only after the crash). But if you were an astute investor, you could have observed a stark difference in what the Senators were saying and how they were trading. For Eg. [Richard Burr reassured the public that the US was well prepared](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/5/14/21258560/senator-richard-burr-coronavirus-insider-trading-scandal-explained) for the pandemic but then sold $1MM worth of stocks in the next two weeks. I know that hindsight is 20/20 but if you could have connected these two dots, then you could have saved up to **25% of your portfolio** before the crash.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are some limitations to the analysis.

a. I have only used one black swan event for the analysis. A better method would be to analyze the stock trading pattern over 3-4 major crashes and see if any pattern emerges. But the current limitation is that efdsearch.senate.gov has only data since 2012.

b. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the transaction amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion**

I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I did not want our political views clouding our financial judgment. I could not find a single example where a retail investor or an institutional investor or even a hedge fund leveraging this information to make their trades (it might just not be public!). Another possible explanation here is that Senators might just have superior stock trading capability as [none of them were indicted for this and all investigations are closed now](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/richard-burr-stock-trades-investigation.html).

However you view it, this analysis in addition to my [last analysis (which proves that Congress Members have better returns than SP500)](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/copy-top-stocks-of-the-week-614493) showcases that there is significant money to be made by following their trades closely!

When you choose to enter a relationship with one person and not another.

When you decide to spend money on fun things while you are young, or to hoard wealth like a dragon in to old age.

A stock market crash is defined as a rapid and unexpected drop in the price of stocks and shares. They are typically short-lived events but can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. And in some cases, they even evolve into a [bear market](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-bear-market-and-how-to-invest-during-one).

* **Stock Market Crash** — A rapid decline in stock prices greater than 20% over a short space of time.
* **Bear Market** — A prolonged decline in stock prices by more than 20%. In extreme cases, a bear market can last for years.

# What causes a stock market crash?

The catalysts behind each stock market crash throughout history have been quite different. But a common theme that emerges across nearly all past events is a weakening economic outlook. As consumers slow their spending, corporate earnings struggle to achieve growth which can spark uncertainty, especially if stock valuations have reached high levels.

Some common factors that can trigger the start of a crash or correction include:

* High Inflation
* Rising Interest Rates
* Natural Disasters
* Overvalued Stocks
* Geopolitical Disputes
* Economic Uncertainty
* Excess Speculation
* Low Investor Sentiment

Looking at the various stock market crashes throughout history reveals just how diverse the causes of these events can be.

# 2020: The Covid-Crash

In early 2020 stock markets worldwide plummeted as entire countries went into lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With non-essential businesses being forced to close and international travel banned, global economies ground to a halt. And for many companies, especially smaller ones, this series of events led to bankruptcy.

However, following a massive injection of government stimulus, Western economies were able to bounce back at a record pace. And with 33 days, the FTSE 100 and S&P 500 indices had completely recovered before being propelled to new record highs.

# 2008: The Global Financial Crisis

After years of loose lending practices for mortgages by American banks, the US housing market became propped up on a massive pile of sub-prime loans. Eventually, millions of people across the country could not keep up with mortgage payments, leading to a surge in foreclosures. The market became flooded with properties and no one to buy them, causing house prices to plummet.

To make matters worse, investment banks were using complex derivatives such as Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs) to hide the level of risk within mortgage bonds. With bond rating agencies selling high ratings to the same investment banks, individual and professional investors unknowingly purchased extremely high-risk assets. This was particularly problematic for pension funds across the United States and Europe.

After default rates began to skyrocket, mortgage bonds collapsed, causing an estimated $1trn of losses worldwide. At the end of the financial crisis, the S&P 500 tumbled by as much as 57%, and it took approximately 17 months for the stock market to recover.

# 2000: The Dotcom Bubble

As the internet began to take the investment community by storm, online-based technology stocks became immensely popular, including businesses which didn’t even have a revenue stream. As mania took over, the valuation of technology stocks reached absurd levels, pushing the Nasdaq up by more than 500% between 1995 and 2000.

Eventually, the bubble burst and the Nasdaq collapsed by 77%. It would take 15 years before the index would return to its same level of valuation.

# 1973: The Oil Crisis

The stock market crash in 1973 was a fairly complicated situation triggered by many different factors. The US economy was already weakened after the decision to engage in the Vietnam war. Pairing this with increased social spending caused the country’s deficit to skyrocket.

At the time, the US dollar followed the gold standard, which meant the Federal Reserve had little control over economic policy. This ultimately led to the abolition of the gold standard in America in 1971. Two years later, the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) introduced an oil embargo on all countries that supported Israel in the Arab-Israeli war. The United States and the United Kingdom were on the list.

What followed was a sudden supply shock for oil. Prices for the fossil fuel more than tripled in a matter of weeks and crippled the US economy for nearly a decade. The **Dow Jones Industrial Average** dropped by as much as 45%, while the UK’s **FT 30** index — one of the oldest indices in the world — dropped by as much as 73%.

The stock recovered within 21 months. But what followed was nearly a decade of multiple recessions, triggering one of the longest bear markets in history.

# 1929: The Great Depression

Following the roaring 20s after World War 1, the US economy expanded rapidly, with the nation’s wealth more than doubled. As the economy was booming, the level of speculation on Wall Street started to get out of hand, with seemingly everyone pouring their money into stocks and shares. And many were even using margin to try and amplify their returns.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its [peak in August 1929](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/great-depression-history). After a slight slowdown in US production and an increase in unemployment, investors started to get spooked, resulting in a panic-selling frenzy that saw a record 12.9 million shares being sold off on what’s now known as Black Thursday.

Things seemed settled for a few days. But then, on October 29, now known as Black Tuesday, this record trading volume was beaten with 16 million shares being sold off. Investors across the United States saw their investments collapse. And most who were using margins put themselves in personal bankruptcy.

The Great Depression is by far one of the worst declines in the history of financial markets. By the time the dust had settled, the Dow Jones had dropped by 89%. And it would take close to 25 years to recover to its former high.

# Are market crashes bad for investors?

As horrendous as experiencing a stock market crash first-hand can be, it can also provide some rare advantages.

As most investors enter into a panic-selling frenzy, plenty of high-quality businesses can get caught in the crossfire. Some tremendous buying opportunities can emerge for those capable of identifying the strong enterprises from the weak while valuations plummet.

The downward trend of the stock market can also cool down overheated stock prices driven by speculation rather than underlying fundamentals. This can be beneficial if asset price inflation starts to get out of control.

Of course, these advantages come paired with some pretty severe setbacks for investors, especially short-term traders. Sudden downward pressure leaves little time for individuals to pull their capital out of the market before stock prices plummet. And all too often, investors sell after shares have already collapsed, leading to the destruction of wealth.

The severity of this effect is also often amplified by traders short-selling to try and profit from the decline of stock prices. Depending on how bad the situation gets and the underlying trigger, stock market crashes can transform into a deeper bear market and even an economic recession.

So, are stock market crashes bad? Yes. But they also create lucrative opportunities for prudent investors.

# How often does the stock market crash?

A stock market crash, by its nature, is unpredictable. While there are leading indicators suggesting a down period may be due to occur, these are often wrong. And even professional investors constantly make predictions that fail to materialise.

Having said that, on average, a stock market crash occurs once every seven years. At least, that’s what history has shown. But in practice, this schedule is rarely followed. For example, after the 2008 global financial crisis, it took nearly 11 years before another crash occurred in 2020, marking one of the longest [bull markets](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-bull-market-and-how-to-invest-during-one) in history. For the investors that sold their shares in 2015 as per the seven-year schedule missed out on another five years of stock market growth.

# How long does a market crash last?

The duration of a stock market crash ultimately depends on what caused it in the first place. For example, a severe economic downturn will take far longer to recover than a short-term supply shock.

Looking at the S&P 500 since 1950 reveals that roughly 63% of stock market crashes and [corrections](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-stock-market-correction-and-what-causes-them) last between two weeks to three and a half months before reaching the bottom. However, on average, it can take up to 18 months before shares recover to their former levels.

# How can investors prepare for a stock market crash?

While a stock market crash is incredibly difficult to predict, that doesn’t mean investors can’t prepare. And several steps can be taken to mitigate the impact of a market downturn on an investment portfolio.

* **Build A Cash Buffer** — One of the biggest mistakes investors make during a stock market crash is to sell shares after the price has collapsed. However, those who need money to cover living expenses may have no choice but to sell at a terrible price. This risk can be mitigated by ensuring sufficient cash is kept in reserve in a savings account.
* **Diversify** — Stock market crashes can hit different industries at varying degrees of severity. The risk of owning shares in the most heavily impacted industry is reduced by ensuring a portfolio containing a wide range of sectors. Similarly, allocating capital across a broad range of alternative asset classes, such as bonds and real estate, can further mitigate the impact of rapidly declining stock prices.
* **Keep Spare Capital** — With panicking investors selling off anything with a pulse, rare buying opportunities for top-notch companies may emerge. By ensuring some capital is kept in reserve, investors will have the money to capitalise on these investment opportunities.

# What should investors do during a market crash?

For investors seeking to capitalise on the buying opportunities that a stock market crash can create, a few considerations need to be taken into account. The most prominent is the heightened level of volatility.

When investor sentiment is low, the slightest bit of bad news can send stocks plummeting. Even if an investor identifies a terrific company trading significantly below its intrinsic valuation, shares can still fall further. Trying to predict when the market or an individual stock has hit its lowest point is a near-impossible task.

Fortunately, there are a few tactics that investors can deploy to mitigate downside risk:

* [**Pound-Cost Averaging**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-exactly-is-pound-cost-averaging) — Instead of investing all residual capital in one go, investors can break it up into smaller chunks and drip-feed it into the markets. That way, investors can buy more at an even better price if an undervalued stock continues to fall. Each time a lower price is paid, the average cost per share in an investment falls, reducing the impact of further price declines after the initial trade.
* **Stop-Loss Orders** — To protect against downside risk, investors can set up a stop-loss order. This is a set of instructions given to a brokerage firm that states that if a company’s share price falls below a certain threshold, the broker should sell the investor’s shares. This can reduce the impact of a severe valuation decline.
* **Stop-Limit Orders** — This type of trade works similarly to a stop-loss order. However, the key difference is that the investor doesn’t close out their entire position. Instead, they can specify how many shares should be sold if a stock price falls below a specified threshold. This also works in reverse. Instead of selling shares, a stop-limit order can be used to buy a specified number of shares once the stock price meets a specified price level.

# The bottom line

Stock market crashes are mostly unpredictable and inevitable events that come with the territory of investing. Investors should construct their portfolios with this risk factor in mind. And ensure that sufficient financial planning has been performed in case the worst comes to pass.

As we’ve seen the small caps market has been getting hit hard, while the big caps are having a field day. This is expected and many traders say this period is normally like this, very slow and even with good news or catalysts there’s very little movement on the small caps.

I am expecting a very contentious election with results that may take days to count or a decision that may be legally challenged by either party. 
I believe that the market will react to this, but I don’t know how.

Part of me is thinking on selling off before the election and keep my liquidity until after the storm.

How can investors use a stock market index?

**Investors can use stock market indices for a variety of purposes. Some of the most common include:**

* **Tracking Market Sentiment** **– Investors can review trends in popular indices to gain insight into how positive or negative investor sentiment currently is. Comparing the 200-day and 50-day moving averages is a common technique used by traders to see which direction stock prices are likely to move in the short-to-medium term.**
* **An Investment** **– Investors cannot directly invest in an index. However, it’s possible to buy shares in an** [**index fund**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-index-fund-and-how-do-they-work) **that replicates the hypothetical portfolio of an index. By doing this, investors will be able to replicate the performance of the underlying index. And since the fund manager handles all the portfolio rebalancing, this approach essentially puts an investment portfolio on autopilot.**
* **Performance Benchmark** **– Some investors prefer to build a custom portfolio by** [**picking individual stocks**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/how-to-pick-stocks-to-invest-in)**. And often, these individuals will want to compare their returns against a suitable index. After all, if a custom portfolio is struggling to keep up or surpass a stock market index, it may be prudent for the investor to change their investment strategy.**
* **Calculating Expected Returns** **– Knowing the average rate of return delivered by an index over a specific period can help investors be more realistic with their personal return expectations. This can help lead to better financial planning for the future.**
* **Calculating Beta** **– Beta represents the volatility of a stock relative to a stock market index. And one of the most popular methods of estimating Beta is by running a linear regression between stock price percentage return against an index’s percentage returns.**

How to analyse a stock market index

**While stock market indices are relatively simple financial instruments, they have a few characteristics that can complicate things. Let’s go through the steps investors need to take when trying to analyse or understand an index and how they are designed to work.**

1. Check what the index tracks

**When searching for an index, investors need to make sure they select an appropriate one. For example, let’s say an investor wants to compare the performance of their custom** [**renewable energy stocks**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/investing-in-renewable-energy-stocks-everything-investors-need-to-know) **portfolio.**

**They could opt to use the FTSE 100 like most investors. However, given the level of concentration within the energy sector, it will likely be more meaningful to compare performance against an energy index.**

2. Check what companies are inside the index

**After creating a list of seemingly suitable stock market indices, an investor may find value in looking closer at which companies are in the index being considered. Some indices have eligibility requirements, such as a minimum market capitalisation.**

**If the investor’s renewable energy portfolio predominantly consists of risky** [**small-cap stocks**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-small-cap-stocks-and-are-they-good-investments)**, using an energy index that requires its constituents to have a large market cap will likely be unsuitable.**

3. Check how the index is weighted

**Every index assigns weightings to each of its constituent stocks. And depending on the method used, some stocks may have a larger influence on the index’s performance than others.**

**Some of the most common index weighting methods include:**

* **Market Capitalisation Weighted** **– The companies within the index with the largest market capitalisation have a greater weighting than those with smaller valuations. This means large-cap stocks have more influence on the performance of an index than smaller-cap ones.**
* **Float-Adjusted Market Capitalisation Weighted** **– Index constituents are weighted the same way as the market capitalisation weighted method. However, the market caps of each stock are adjusted to remove the effects of non-investable shares. As such, any shares held by controlling investors or government institutions are excluded. The FTSE 100 and S&P 500 are both examples of a float-adjusted market cap-weighted index.**
* **Price-Weighted** **– The companies within an index are weighted based on their share price. Therefore, stocks that trade at a higher stock price have more influence on the index’s performance than shares trading at low prices. Note that market capitalisation does not have any impact on the weighting decision. Even if a company has a market cap of $1trn, it may still have a lower weighting than a $50bn firm if the share price is trading lower. The** [**Dow Jones Industrial Average**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-dow-jones-and-how-does-it-work) **is an example of a price-weighted index.**
* **Equal-Weighted** **– Every index constituent has the same weighting regardless of market cap or stock price.**
* **Volume-Weighted** **– The weighting of index constituents is determined by how frequently their shares are being traded. The companies with a higher average trading volume will receive the greatest weighting.**
* **Fundamental Weighting** **– The weight of each stock in an index is determined based on some fundamental metric, such as revenue, earnings, cash flow, or book value. The firms with the highest fundamental values will have the highest weighting.**

Leading UK stock indices

**The list of** [**UK stock market indices**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-uk-stock-market-indices-and-how-do-they-work) **is long. However, some of the most popular indices used as benchmarks include:**

* [**FTSE 100**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-ftse-100-and-how-does-it-work) **– The stock market index tracks the performance of the largest 100 UK stocks by market cap.**
* [**FTSE 250**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-ftse-250-and-how-does-it-work) **– This stock market index tracks the performance of the 101st to the 250th largest UK stocks by market cap.**
* [**FTSE 350**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-ftse-350-and-how-does-it-work) **– This index comprises both FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies. Investing in an index tracking its performance provides another alternative.**
* **FTSE AIM 100** **– This index includes the largest 100 UK stocks by market capitalisation, which have their primary listing on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).**

Leading US stock indices

**Multiple US stock market indices are quoted regularly within financial media and the investing community. Some of the most popular include:**

* [**S&P 500**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-sp-500-and-how-does-it-work) **– This stock market index tracks the performance of a total of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.**
* [**Dow Jones Industrial Average**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-dow-jones-and-how-does-it-work) **– Contains 30 of the most prominent publically traded businesses in the United States.**
* **Nasdaq 100** **– This index consists of the 100 largest and most actively traded listed companies on the** **Nasdaq Stock Exchange.**
* **Russell 2000** **– A market cap index that measures the performance of the 2,000 smaller companies listed in the United States.**

How to invest in a stock market index?

**As previously mentioned, a stock market index is not a tradable financial security. It’s merely a hypothetical portfolio designed to track specific industries or sections of the stock market. As such, investing in an index is not actually possible.**

**However, investors can replicate an index’s performance with a low-cost index fund. We’ve written a** [**complete beginner’s guide**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/how-to-invest-in-index-funds-a-beginners-guide) **to investing in an index fund. However, the process can be briefly summarised into three primary steps.**

2. **Pick an Appropriate Fund**
3. **Buy Shares in the Fund.**

Fundamental analysis,EducatedInvesting,"Introduction to Fundamental Analysis: Definition, Components, Macroeconomic Indicators","There are two types of analysis used in investing and trading – fundamental and technical. The first type allows you to assess the real value of an asset and its capabilities and prospects, while the second one studies the price change. In trading, a price change is necessary to determine the entry and exit points.

**Fundamental analysis definition:**

Fundamental analysis makes it possible to understand how attractive the acquisition of the shares is and what their growth prospects are. All investment processes originate from analytics. The decision to buy or sell a stock is based on various economic indicators. It can be inflation, the situation on the world market, changes in GDP, etc. There is always a definite correlation between all these indicators. Fundamental analysis allows you to notice this correlation, study it and make an optimal choice.

Fundamental analysis involves studying accounting and financial statements of companies in order to determine the real value of assets. So the influence of the economy and the political situation in the country and in the world, the position of the company and the actions of competitors are taken into account. Fundamental analysis requires constant control of the market, since any news can have an enormous impact on the market. Therefore players speculating in the market exit the deal in order not to lose much during the publication of important news due to the trading turbulence.

**Fundamental analysis components:**

Fundamental analysis flows from Graham and Dodd’s book “Security analysis”. It proposes fundamental analysis components. It consists of macroeconomic analytics, then industry (sectoral) analytics, the study of the issuing company and the valuation of the securities. Graham was a successful investor. Warren Buffett is also a famous example of the use of fundamental analysis.

**Fundamental analysis methods:**

Let’s move on to the methods of fundamental analysis. The following classical methods of analysis are most often used in fundamental analysis:

* **comparison** of the object of study with other objects;
* **correlation** is used to study the dependence of objects, that means to measure how changes of one object affect the changes of another;
* **deduction and induction** imply a transition from the general to the particular (characteristics of the industry as a whole and a particular company) or from the particular to the general (studying of previous data of the company’s activities and their impact on economic indicators);
* **seasonality** involves the influence of cycles of production, social or weather processes on the formation of prices;
* **generalization and grouping** mean the division of the issuer’s indicators into groups according to certain characteristics. Such a study should be carried out on the basis of the company’s balance sheet.

**Step  № 1: Macroeconomic indicators**

The fundamental analysis begins with the research of trends in the global economy as a whole. Then you move on to the research of the economy of countries and industries. Macroeconomic indicators include GDP growth, the inflation rate and the Central Bank rate.

Stable GDP growth signals that the country’s economy is developing, and the national currency is getting stronger. Such a signal is important since due to the depreciation of the currency, part of the profit from assets in this currency can be “eaten up”. If GDP grows, it means that funds are being poured into the stock market and in this case there are more chances to earn money on it.

The Central Bank’s rates represent the cost of money, the availability of loans and consumer demand. When interest rates are low, the value of shares increases since enterprises can get cheap loans and direct these funds to production. In addition, if domestic demand grows, the products of enterprises are bought more actively.

The unemployment rate significantly affects consumer demand, as well as the efficiency of enterprises.

Also oil prices, gold and foreign exchange reserves and the level of the money supply are additionally studied. It’s also important to pay attention to the current policy of the government and the Central Bank.

Thus, fundamental analysis is based on the research of macroeconomic indicators, industries, company’s position and on the analysis of securities. In the article, we have considered the first stage of the analysis. In the near future,  indicators of fundamental analysis are planned to be added to MonInvAI's platform for more accurate forecasts.",13,good stuff..,,

Fundamental analysis,EducatedInvesting,"Fundamental Analysis: Attractiveness of the industry, Financial Ratios, Book and Market values","In the first part of the article, we got acquainted with fundamental analysis and studied the first stage of fundamental assessment – the analysis of macroeconomic indicators. In the second part, we will focus on industry attractiveness levels and financial ratios.

**Step №2: Analysis of the attractiveness of the industry**

The industries are analyzed depending on their investment attractiveness and liquidity. Here are the sectoral types of investment attractiveness:

* **Crisis industry**: its feature is a great drop in production.
* **Depressive industry**: stagnant, development prospects are either lacking or unclear.
* **Stable industry**: the growth of the industry can be described as stable and promising, and its performance is above the national average.
* A **promising industry** has the potential for development and investments under clear, targeted comprehensive programs. Its feature is a small volume of production, but in the future investments may pay off.
* A **growing industry** is in the growth stage and has high profitability. The enterprises of the industry steadily make profits, so the volume of production grows.
* **Cyclical industry:** the return and risk of investments in stocks of companies in this industry depend on the economic cycle phase. In general, these are industries that produce means of production, as well as durable goods.
* A **seasonal industry** is characterized by an irregular output of products due to the season, climate, and demand for products.

The investor’s task is to identify the most promising sector of the economy and invest accordingly in the shares of the companies. The higher the liquidity of a stock, the faster an investor can get income. If the liquidity of the financial asset is low, then it is more difficult to sell or buy shares vice versa. For the convenience of analysis stock indices are used. As a rule, this type of indicator is calculated for the most significant sectors of the economy. For example, the S&P 500 Information Technology for evaluating the information technology sector.

**Step № 3: Analysis of the company and securities**

Assessing the value of a company, an investor studies profit, dividends, growth rates, the ratio of debt and equity capital. Also free cash flow is calculated, the return on equity is analyzed and the company’s growth rates are predicted. Moreover, the company’s activities, its reputation, technologies used in production, as well as company management are examined. All financial indicators of the company are compared with those of competitors, as well as with the industry averages.

There are two types of company values, which most often don’t coincide. These are book and market values. The last one is conditioned by the ratio of supply and demand. The most attractive for investors is the situation when the market value of the company is lower than the book value or the real value of the assets. Then the company’s shares can be considered undervalued. In this case, investors expect that the share price will rise, as it will tend to the book price.

In the book “Analysis of Securities” by Graham and Dodd, which we mentioned in the first part of the article, the following idea was formulated: “The value of a share depends on its prospects in the future.”

Furthermore, we will consider the financial ratios in more detail. Since companies represented on the stock market are from different industries, with different scales of activity, different reputations, it’s rather difficult to compare them with each other. 

The financial ratios simplify the life of investors. As they allow, using a single scale, not only to determine the real state of affairs of a particular company, but also to compare its financial performance with others.

Here are the most popular multipliers:

* **P / E** (Capitalization to Net Profit Ratio) allows us to calculate how many years it will take for an investment to pay off while maintaining the current profit of the company. The ratio was proposed by Graham and Dodd as an estimate of the fair value of the shares. The value of the indicator is usually in the range of 7 to 30. The indicator below the range indicates the undervaluation of the company’s shares and attracts investors.
* **P / S** (Capitalization to Revenue Ratio) shows how much the investor pays per unit of revenue. A coefficient value less than 2 is okay. A value less than 1 indicates underestimation.
* **P / BV** (The ratio of capitalization to the company’s capital; the ratio of the market price of a share to the value of assets per share)  makes it clear what the investor will get in case of bankruptcy of the company. A value greater than one indicates that if the company goes bankrupt, then there will not be enough funds to pay off debts for all shareholders. A value less than one, on the contrary, shows that, in case of bankruptcy, all shareholders will be paid their shares.
* **EV** (Capitalization of the company + debt liabilities – available cash) is the fair value of the company.
* **EV / EBITDA** (The ratio of the company’s value to pre-tax profit) shows the period of time for the unspent depreciation, interest and taxes, the profit of the company to pay off the cost of acquiring the company. The multiplier is similar to the P / E, but more reliable for comparing companies. The evaluation procedure is the same, the lower the value, the better.
* **EPS** (The ratio of net income to the number of common shares): the growth EPS rate is used for the analysis (the percentage of the current indicator to the past). Often, a sharp decline or rise in profits will cause a stock price movement. 
* **ROE** (net profit to equity)  shows how much profit a unit of equity capital brings, thereby you can judge the efficiency of the company.

Thus, fundamental analysis is based on the study of macroeconomic indicators, sectors in order to choose the most promising option, the state of an individual company and on the study of securities separately.

Novice investors need to clearly distinguish between market and book value of assets. It’s usually better to buy those assets that are currently undervalued by the market since they are likely to rise in price. You can choose a company using financial ratios that allow you not only to assess the state of the company, but also to compare it with competitors. Soon, MonInvAI will add additional fundamental analysis indicators for even more accurate forecasts.",14,,,

# Price

[FB Chart as of this weekend](https://preview.redd.it/aiqf6oyzj3371.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f80699de5b4d2c6abad48b28d991e7848ec2514)

Facebook currently trades at around $330. Its latest support is at around $296 to $300 and its latest resistance is actually around $330 so essentially the price that it's trading for right now. This is a crucial moment. If it manages to break $330, then we can see an upward movement going up to $360 which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming. If you haven't invested yet, it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve. I have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to $315 or, worst case scenario, $300. It is currently trading above its 50D MA and its Relative Strength Index is near the top, but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably won't see a lot of movement in the next week or two. However, as I said, I think that there is a good chance that we can see Facebook hitting $360 in a few months and maybe even $400 by the end of the year. Why? Well, Facebook has been delivering great results after great results. The fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far. Absolutely amazing! In fact, out of ALL of its 20 earnings reports since 2016, it has only missed 1 and that was by 1 cent and it has only missed revenue ***twice***! The company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin, especially in the last 4 quarters. Last quarter, it beat analyst earnings expectations by 41%! This is massive! Especially for a company of Facebook's size! Essentially, what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that Facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected. Also, there has been nothing but upward revisions for Facebook's Full Year 2021 earnings, which is a very good sign. 39 upward revisions in total! There have also been 23 upward earnings revisions for next quarter's earnings, which is almost always a good sign. Also, out of the 51 analyst covering Facebook in May, 45 have had a Buy or a Strong Buy rating!

# The Business

However, let's leave analyst opinions aside for the moment. They are good to gauge Wall Street's appetite for the company, but let's look at the business, at the fundamentals. Is Facebook really a good company? Facebook's main source of revenue are the ***advertising revenues that*** come from ads on its products, the Facebook app and website, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger. By gathering user data, Facebook is able to offer targeted ads which are obviously more expensive, but are also more attractive to advertisers. Even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that Facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its ads, the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a LOT! Another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the 7th most website in the world, Facebook, which is also the 2nd most visited social media website behind YouTube. Instagram is extremely popular as well, ranking in the 23rd place! As of the latest quarter, the Daily active users of Facebook's family of products are 2.72 BILLION with the number of monthly active users being 3.45 BILLION or more than 10 times the population of the US! This is literally half of the world's population! Facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up 15% year-on-year which is actually faster than last year's increase of 11%. So, we can see that their user base is growing, but is that translating into higher revenues? The answer: yes! In 2020, Facebook reported a 20% year-on-year advertising revenue increase, but in their last quarter alone, the advertising revenue increase was 46% compared to last year! Advertising makes about 98% of Facebook's revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits. Their net income also grew by 58% in 2020 year-on-year and an astonishing 94% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to last year! Essentially, we can see that Facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business. However, Facebook are also involved in Virtual and Augmented Reality through their Reality Labs. While this side of Facebook is still tiny, it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well. In the first quarter of 2021, its revenue grew by almost 150% as compared to last year and now makes up 2.7% of Facebook's revenue! VR and AR are still relatively young industries, but they are growing fast as we can see. Market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of 42% from $37B in 2019 to an astonishing $1.27T in 2030! Facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with Apple, Microsoft and Samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for Facebook. Unlike its competitors, Facebook's business is relatively concentrated so I think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its VR and AR business. The company has also grown its headcount by 30% in 2020 so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth. Despite that, analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about 15% annually for the next 3 years. To some extent, that is justified as Facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to COVID. However, I think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and I think that Facebook can actually achieve a growth of between 20% and 25%, especially when we consider the VR and AR business. This may sound optimistic, but given Facebook's record of beating analyst estimates, I am okay with sounding optimistic. The only hurdle that Facebook may run into is regulation, which is always on the table for big tech companies like it. However, it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so I'll take my chances.

# The Balance Sheet

Now, you may be thinking, great, Facebook is positioned well for the future, but how are the fundamentals looking right now? We can see they are growing, but can they support that growth? Personally, I think so. Facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents. They currently have just over $64B as of 31th March 2021 which represents a $2-2.5B increase from the end of December 2020 and an increase of almost $10B since December 2019. The huge cash positions means that Facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing, it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition, but most importantly, it means that the company is doing well. We can also see that in the company's share repurchase program. Facebook has repurchased $6.3B of shares in 2020 and $4.2B of shares in 2019 and, in January 2021, it authorized an additional $25B of stock repurchases so the total right now is about $34B. This doesn't mean that they will repurchase all $34B, but that they can. Still, the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign. In addition to their massive stockpile of cash, Facebook only has liabilities of $30B or less than half the size of its cash stockpile. What does that mean? It means that Facebook is healthy and it's taking its vitamins. The company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short- or medium-term challenges to its business. It has no long-term debt, meaning that if they do decide to borrow money, they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals.

# The Ratios

Then, if we look at some the fundamental ratios, we can see that Facebook is. A. Beast! Their Return-on-Assets is 20.3% compared to the industry's average of 10.3% and their Return-on-Equity was 25.3% last year! Lets compare it to its rivals. I think that the companies closest to Facebook in terms of business are Twitter, Google, and Snapchat although Snap is in very early stages of growth. In terms of ROA and ROE, both Snapchat and Twitter are negative so there's not much point in comparing them, but Google has a 15.3% ROA. Their ROE is also lower at 22.3% as opposed to Facebook's 25.3%. Now, Facebook's forward Price-to-earnings ration is only 21.6 whereas Google has 25.5, Twitter's is 52.4 and Snapchat has a Forward PE of 92, so again, Facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings. In terms of current PE, Facebook has 28.2, Google has 32.2 and Snapchat and Twitter don't have one because they are unprofitable. The current S&P average PE is 37.2 so we can see that both Facebook and Google are under the market average although Facebook is again cheaper. What these ratios tell us is that Facebook is not only operating a very efficient business, but it's also at a very good price relative to its peers. Even looking at it historically, Facebook has rarely dropped below a PE of 27-28 so the current price is, again, excellent and cheap. This is my own opinion, feel free to do your own research, but according to my personal EPS growth we can expect a roughly 12% annual return on Facebook over the next 10 years if we buy it at $330. That is assuming a 15% earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a PE ratio of around 30-32. If the earnings grow at around 20% next year, then we can look at a roughly 15% annual return which is higher than the average return of the S&P 500, meaning that Facebook is likely to beat the market, at least in my opinion.

# TDLR;

Facebook is:

* showing growth in userbase, especially in emerging markets
* showing huge growth in the AR and VR business, which is overlooked by most analysts, but is an amazing long-term opportunity
* healthy as hell - no debt, more than 2 times cash and cash equivalents than liabilities
* the cheapest out of the FAANG stocks and actually the majority of the market
* potentially reaching $400 by the end of the year although it may dip to $315 or, worst case scenario, $300

Fundamental analysis,EducatedInvesting,Guide: How to Pick Stocks to Invest In,"Learning how to pick stocks is a common endeavour among investors. After all, there are [roughly 58,200](https://focus.world-exchanges.org/articles/number-listed-companies) publically listed companies to choose from. And the majority won’t deliver market-beating returns.

The art of stock picking is applying fundamental or technical analysis to determine whether a stock qualifies as a good investment. And when executed well, it can generate enormous returns for investors, far exceeding what a [mutual fund](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-mutual-fund) or [exchange-traded fund (ETF)](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-etf-and-how-do-they-work) can offer.

It’s how Warren Buffett became a billionaire, and Peter Lynch went down as one of the greatest fund managers in the history of Wall Street.

So, let’s explore the critical factors that go into a stock-picking strategy.

[**Originally Published on The Money Cog**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/how-to-pick-stocks-to-invest-in)

### What are the four main investment strategies?

Like every chess player forms a strategy and game plan, a stock picker needs to do the same.

Numerous investment strategies are commonly deployed, each with its advantages and disadvantages. What’s important to realise is that a strategy is only suitable under specific circumstances. That means investors need to pick the approach that’s most appropriate to achieve their [investment goals](https://themoneycog.com/articles/how-to-define-investment-goals-in-5-easy-steps).

Investment strategies can be placed into one of four primary categories. However, it’s worth noting that some investors like to use a combination to meet their investment objectives.

### 1. Passive Income

A passive income strategy is also known as [income investing](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-income-investing-and-is-it-worth-it). This is where investors seek to generate an additional income stream using the stock market. As such, they often gravitate toward businesses that offer a chunky and reliable dividend.

Various financial metrics can give insight into whether a company can maintain their dividends, such as the dividend yield and payout ratio. However, a common shortcut investors can use is to simply look at the [list of dividend aristocrats](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-dividend-aristocrat-and-should-i-buy-these-stocks).

These are the dividend stocks that have raised shareholder payouts each year for at least 25 years. And some investors like to take this one step further by only looking at dividend kings — stocks that have paid an increasing dividend for more than 50 years in a row.

Outside the realm of the stock market, fixed-income debt instruments like [high-yield bonds](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-high-yield-investments) are also a popular asset class that passive income investors often explore.

### 2. Capital Appreciation

A capital appreciation strategy where [growth investing](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-growth-investing-and-is-it-worth-it) and value investing come into play. This is where investors seek to grow their investment portfolio by buying low and selling high. In other words, their focus is on finding a business whose stock price has the potential to surge. As such, they often focus on shares with impressive sales and earnings growth rates.

Investing in a growth stock opens the door to potentially explosive performance. But that comes at the added cost of risk. These shares are significantly more volatile, often falling by double digits when investor expectations aren’t met or when economic conditions worsen.

Investing in value stocks can be equally daunting. While identifying an undervalued business can be a lucrative long-term investment, it can sometimes take a long time for the stock market to reflect the true value of a company. For investors without sufficient patience, even a correct analysis may result in a poor-performing investment.

### 3. Wealth Preservation

Not every investor is seeking to build wealth. Some are already fortunate enough to be rich and are seeking a way to preserve their wealth. This usually means sticking to low-volatility stocks of mature enterprises in a highly diversified portfolio spanning multiple industries and geographies.

There are also several alternative investment instruments commonly held by wealth-preserving investors. The list typically includes [money market funds](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-money-market-fund-and-how-do-they-work), ETFs, commodities like gold, and government bonds.

### 4. Speculation

Investors with a high tolerance for extreme risk can sometimes deploy a speculative investment strategy. This often boils down to investing in a [penny stock](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-penny-stocks-and-are-they-a-good-investment), [micro-cap stock](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-micro-cap-stocks-and-are-they-a-good-investment), or leveraged ETF. These are tiny businesses with enormous upside potential. Yet, even the most promising start-up can fail to deliver, and the vast majority end up crashing to zero.

That’s why many associates the speculation strategy with gambling rather than investing. And investors interested in executing this strategy should be prepared to potentially lose everything.

### How to analyse stocks

In their famous book — Security Analysis — Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd described stock analysis as *“the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic.”*

The whole purpose of researching and analysing stocks is to help investors make more informed decisions. And today, a wealth of information is readily available from websites, financial media, regulatory filings, and stock research services like our [**Premium Platform**](https://themoneycog.com/).

There are two primary methods of stock analysis:

* **Fundamental Analysis** — This involves analysing a company to determine its intrinsic value and future potential. The investor seeks to understand the business model, the industry it operates in, financial standing, operating efficiency, management team, as well as other business-specific factors.
* **Technical Analysis** — This involves analysing trends and patterns in the share price movements of a stock. Using these technical indicators, the individual investor can make a prediction of what’s coming in the next hour, day, week, or even month. It’s the method of choice for short-term traders attempting to profit from the mood and momentum of the stock market rather than the underlying fundamentals of a business.

There are also two approaches used when deciding which stocks are worth analysing in the first place:

* **Top-Down Analysis** — This is arguably the most common approach used by investors and involves using a stock screener to identify opportunities. Instead of looking at companies straight away, an analyst first looks at the state of the economy. From there, they determine which industries have the most potential before deciding which sub-sectors in these industries are looking promising. The analyst then applies fundamental or technical analysis on the pool of companies within the selected sub-sector to pick the best-looking investments.
* **Bottom-Up Analysis** — With this approach, investors start by analysing companies directly, either based on fundamental or technical metrics. The businesses are then compared to their parent subsectors and industries to determine whether they are a good pick. This approach can often be more time-consuming than Top-Down due to the lack of initial screening. However, it also highlights which stocks to avoid as well as potential winners.

When learning how to pick stocks, it’s often recommended that investors explore each strategy and use the one that they feel most comfortable with.

### What are the main factors to consider when picking stocks?

Beyond identifying which businesses are the best stocks to buy, investors must also consider their personal circumstances.

* **Investment Goals** — Does the stock align with the investor’s investment goals? High-growth shares are likely unsuitable in a portfolio designed to preserve wealth.
* **Time Horizon** — Does the investment thesis surrounding a stock match the investor’s time horizon? Investing in a business that needs a decade to deliver on its mission is likely unsuitable for an investor seeking to withdraw their capital within the next five years.
* **Risk Tolerance** — Is the stock too volatile for an investor to sleep well at night? Investors who have a low-risk tolerance are likely ill-suited to own risky penny stocks.
* **Personal Values** — Does the stock meet the investor’s ethical and moral requirements? With [ESG investing](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-esg-investing-and-is-it-worth-it) becoming more popular, some investors are boycotting companies operating in the tobacco, gambling, and arms dealing industries.

### Stock portfolio management

Beyond learning how to pick stocks, investors also need to learn how to manage their [investment portfolio](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-investment-portfolio-and-how-do-i-build-one). Portfolio management is a critical step on an investing journey. And when combined with skilled stock picking can unlock substantial returns while keeping risk in check.

There are two primary ways investors can manage their portfolios, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

### 1. Active Investing

[Active investing](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-active-investing-and-is-it-worth-it) entails the constant buying and selling of stocks or investments to achieve higher returns. In picking stocks, an investor aims to buy stocks low and sell them high, moving in and out of the market frequently.

**Advantages**

* Can achieve market-beating investment returns.
* Offers greater control over which stocks an investor owns, building an investment portfolio that reflects their goals, risk tolerance, and moral values.

**Disadvantages**

* More frequent transactions result in higher trading costs.
* Requires high-quality research and analysis that an investor may not have the expertise to execute. Hiring an [investment adviser](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-investment-adviser-and-do-i-need-one) can overcome this problem, but these professionals can be expensive.

### 2. Passive Investing

[Passive investing](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-passive-investing-and-is-it-worth-it) entails money being invested solely in [index funds](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-index-fund-and-how-do-they-work) and not actively checking their performance. This strategy suits investors who want to put their portfolio on autopilot, matching the returns of a benchmark index like the **FTSE 100** or the **S&P 500**.

**Advantages**

* Matches the stock market’s performance with little to no research or stock analysis required.
* Requires fewer transactions reducing annual trading fees.

**Disadvantages**

* Investors have limited control over which stocks they own, with morally objectionable shares such as gambling, tobacco, and arms dealing businesses being blended into the mix.
* Impossible to achieve market-beating returns.

This style of investing is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its simplicity and decent returns. By comparison, most active investors fail to beat the stock market mainly due to a lack of skill and emotional discipline.

### Who are the most famous stock pickers?

* **Warren Buffett** — Considered by many as one of the greatest investors of all time, picking high-quality stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value and holding them for decades.
* **Charlie Munger** — Warren Buffett’s right-hand man, serving as a friend and fellow stock picker at Berkshire Hathaway.
* **Peter Lynch** — A legendary stock picker on Wall Street who formerly managed the Magellan fund delivering an average annual return of 29.2% between 1977 and 1990.
* **Nick Train** — A star stock picker focusing on UK and global investments who co-founded Lindsell Train in 2000.
* **Cathie Wood** — A widely acclaimed stock-picker who founded a $60bn (assets) worth ARK Invest. She focuses on investing in disruptive stocks.
* **Benjamin Graham** — Considered to be the father of value investing, Graham taught many investors, including Warren Buffett, how to identify companies trading below their intrinsic value.
* **Philip Fisher** — Considered to be the father of growth investing, Fisher was once one of the largest money managers in the world.
* **John Templeton** — Famous for using fundamental analysis rather than technical analysis to find buying opportunities in the stock market. He founded the Templeton Growth fund in 1954, which delivered an average annual return of 15% for 38 years.
* **John Maynard Keynes** — Considered to be the father of modern economics, Keynes achieved market-beating investment returns during World War 2, achieving an average 13.2% annual return between 1928 and 1945.
* **John Bogle** — The founder of Vanguard, who pioneered low-cost index tracker funds.
* **Jim Slater** — Was one of the top investors in London in the 1960s and 1970s, popularising small-cap investing and the use of the Price-Earnings-Growth Factor, also known as the PEG ratio.
* **George Soros** — Considered to be one of the greatest hedge fund managers of all time. Soros Fund Management has delivered investors with a 20% average annualised return for more than 40 years.

### Alternatives to stock picking

Becoming a stock picker is not an easy task and requires a lot of time, dedication, and skill. While investors can pay for a research service or hire an analyst to take care of the research process, they may still fail to achieve market-beating returns if they lack emotional discipline.

Investing in an individual stock can be a volatile experience that many investors aren’t able to stomach. Fortunately, there are alternative methods of investing in the stock market that doesn’t require investors to learn how to pick stocks.

* **Index Funds** — These funds track the performance of a stock market index. By buying an index fund, an investor can match the performance of an underlying benchmark index without having to research any stocks.
* **Exchange-Traded Funds** — These funds provide a low-cost method of tracking indices, sectors, commodities, and currencies, with a professional investment manager making all the decisions on behalf of shareholders.
* **Mutual Funds** — These funds can deploy active as well as passive investing strategies and provide a route for investors to potentially outperform the stock market without having to pick individual stocks themselves.
* **Robo-Advisers** — Investors fill out a questionnaire designed to determine their time horizon, risk tolerance, and investment objectives.

Technical analysis,EducatedInvesting,"Innovative technical analysis: Automated Trading, Trading Robots","**Algorithmic** (also called **automated** trading) is the conduct of purchase and sale operations in financial markets using specialized programs – trading robots. 

The tasks of trading robots are to analyze prices according to specified algorithms, to make decisions and, as a result, to perform trading operations on the market.  
Robot trading is widely used in the markets and its share relative to manual transactions is only growing. A computer program has many advantages:

* Does not get tired
* Stress-free
* Strictly follows the algorithm
* Reacts significantly faster to changes in the market

**Robo-advisors**

Among the programs for automated trading two broad categories can be distinguished: trading robots and indicators. The first ones are intended for performing trading operations in the markets, and the second ones – for analyzing quotes and identifying the change of patterns .  
A trading robot or robo-advisor is a program capable of performing any actions at the request of an investor without his direct participation.

The disadvantages of robo-advisors include the following:

* Almost all high-quality profitable trading robots cost money. The cost of a trading robot on average ranges from $100 to $300.
* 99% of free advisors that can be found on the net deserve attention only as examples, samples for new ideas, but not full-fledged automated trading systems.
* It is believed that with all its advantages, an advisor will never completely replace a living human trader. Only a trader can see and take into account some of the details that are hidden from the bot machine. The bot will always trade according to a given pattern, emotional stress still remains, since transactions take place on money. There is no getting away from this, you can only change your attitude and treat this fact more calmly.
* You need a dedicated server VPS (VPS) for automated trading. It is quite cheap –  $5-30 per month.
* The market changes over time, which implies the adaptation of the advisor trading algorithm. But not every robo-advisor can be optimized.
* Most of trading robots use Martingale, that means an increase in the rate (transaction volume) after a loss. This approach carries high risks of losing the deposit.

**Creation of a trading robot**

Trading robots are written in the MQL programming language. It allows you to program easily an investment system that will invest online. For programmers who are familiar with this language, such work will not be difficult. For ordinary users, this will be a more difficult task. Therefore, many decide to buy their own advisor.  
All advisors are recognized as unique programs due to the applied neural network technology. Since the software collects and analyzes data, adapting to the external market environment, it can be mentioned that the program does not have a specific strategy, but acts like a living person. The robot is constantly studying the market and looking for matches with profitable entry points that have already worked well. In fact, the assistant adjusts the existing algorithm to the required patterns and acts according to the situation.  
All advisors have one definite disadvantage. If their “stuffing” is not adjusted from time to time in accordance with the market, the information begins to slowly but surely become outdated. The result will be wrong decisions, unprofitable transactions and zeroing of the deposit balance. Therefore, it is useless to test the robot’s efficiency on old quotes.  
There are a lot of trading robots on the Internet, but it is very difficult to find a profitable one, and if you apply lots of them, then there is a great risk of being left without money. That’s why it is better not to buy an advisor without researching it. Consider also the fact that many advisors can demonstrate excellent results when testing on one pair of currencies, but poorly on others. Therefore, it is better to use the advisor on the instruments on which it was tested.  
Advisors are based on various technical analysis tools. The most popular and successful ones are based on the Martingale strategy, trading with moving averages, Bollinger bands, and a grid.

**Martingale strategy in trading**

The basis of the phenomenon is the principle of doubling the trade size every time a loss is faced. Literally the term means – “to play in an absurd manner.” Judging by the meaning, it is understood that the method is related to high-speed and high-profit trading strategies. Precisely because of this, it is used a lot by newcomers who come to the trade with small amount of money.

When the market turns against you, all that needs to be done is just wait. But to wait for a pleasant trend, you need to have not only patience, but also a sufficient amount of money. The deeper the loss is, the more it is necessary to open additional positions. It seems that the trader is trying to reverse the movement of the price , spends a lot of energy and money on it. Therefore, when the market is finally turning to his side, the trader has a regular volume of open positions, which will allow hi, to compensate for all the losses and he will win a lot. This is the Martingale method.  
The most successful advisors based on this strategy are Forever Hacked Pro, Forever Warrior EA, Unimillion.

**Moving Average Trading**

A moving average is a technical indicator used to display the average value of an asset over a given period. It is an indicator based on past values such as high, low, open or close, or even trading volume. So trading strategies can be very diverse.  
An example of advisors is Ultron.

**Bollinger Bands Trading**

Bollinger Bands are one of the most popular technical analysis tools used in the modern trading environment. Bollinger Bands are a chart with price channels that reflect a range of volatility. Within this range, the price of a stock can rise or fall.  
When using Bollinger Bands, the lower and upper bands are often identified as price targets. In this case, you buy when the price reaches the lower band and exit when the price reaches the moving average in the center of the bands. Other traders prefer to sell when the price falls below the lower band, or buy when the price breaks above the upper band.  
Milky Way, MILLION DOLLAR PIPS are examples of such advisors.

**Grid trading**

This method is very common among novice traders, as it does not require special knowledge regarding the foreign exchange market, and even such common things as technical or fundamental analysis. But a successful grid strategy means knowledge of the main trend at a selected time interval – up, down, or lateral price movement with a periodic return to the average value.  
This method allows you to place orders at specified intervals in a specific price range. During grid trading, orders are placed above and below the set price, creating a grid of orders with gradually increasing and decreasing prices. As a result, a trading grid is created. For example, a trader can place buy orders every $1,000 below the bitcoin market price, and also place sell orders every $1,000 above its market price. This allows you to benefit from trading under various conditions.  
Grid trading is ideal for use in volatile and sideways markets when prices fluctuate within a given range. This trading method allows you to make a profit with small price changes. The more frequent the grid, the more often trades will be made.

Examples of grid robo-advisors are Pionex, Bitsgap, KuCoin.

Thus, even if it is difficult for you to entrust your funds to a computer program, you can set up the advisor to generate sound alerts, which will greatly facilitate the work and allow you to spend less time on graphical analysis and waiting for signals to open or close positions.

Automatic trading is an example of new trends in trading. However, using only one tool in market analysis is unwise. Therefore, traders most often use different types of technical and fundamental analysis tools together. An example of the use of technical analysis and, on its basis, the introduction of artificial intelligence is MonInvAI, which predicts the values ​​of stocks and cryptocurrencies for the future period.",2,,,

Technical analysis,EducatedInvesting,Technical analysis: Types of trends and Japanese candlestick chart,"In the first part of the article we studied the basic principles of technical analysis and began to get acquainted with the price chart. Now we will pay even more attention to charts and technical indicators.

A price chart is a stream of data on exchange transactions. It looks like a changing over time line. The points of the line are a reflection of information about the price and time of transactions.

The chart has a linear form and is tick according to the time interval of construction. This graph shows each price change. Tick chart is a chart that is formed not by time, but by deals. That is, when a deal is carried out, a tick is formed.

However, due to the huge amount of data, the tick chart is not easy to analyze. Therefore, in order to optimize graphical analysis, the data on the chart is displayed in accordance with the selected time interval or timeframe. 

**Types of trends**

As you could already understand, the direction of the price is formed by the market participants. One of the tasks of technical analysis is to determine the trend of this direction.

An uptrend is characterized by a sequence of upward highs. This means that each local high (maximum) is higher than the previous one. The same situation is with the local lows (minima) of the growing trend – they are ascending.

The inability of the market to overcome the previous high indicates a weakening of the trend and is an early warning of its reversal. Any drop below the previous minimum signals a reversal and the beginning of a downward trend.

If the growing trend failed to become higher than the previous high, but there was no closing below the previous low, we can say that the market is entering a sideways movement.

Local highs and lows of the falling trend form a downward trend. The inability of the market to close below the previous low, and then a successful attempt to overcome the previous high, indicates a reversal of the downward trend.

By analogy with an uptrend, if the market closes above the previous low, but cannot overcome the previous high, the market enters the trading range, and the downtrend is replaced by a flat.

**Japanese candlestick chart**

A regular line chart for a certain timeframe will contain information only about the closing price. To display a larger amount of data, another type of graphical interpretation of data is used – **Japanese candlestick charts**. This type is the most informative.

A **Japanese candlestick** represents a change in the price of an asset over a certain time period. It contains information about the opening, closing, maximum and minimum prices. 

The Japanese **candlesticks** look like this: the low and high are connected by a vertical line. A rectangle is built between the opening and closing prices. This rectangle will be colored in one of two colors, depending on whether the candle was growing (white, green) or falling (black, red).

The candlestick consists of a body and shadows (tails). The body of the candlestick is a rectangle connecting the opening and closing prices. The shadow or tail is that vertical line between the body and the low or high.

There are three types of Japanese candlesticks:

* **rising** — if the opening price is lower than the closing price;
* **falling** — if the opening price is higher than the closing price;
* **doji** — if the opening and closing prices are the same or close.

**What conclusions can be drawn from the shapes and sizes of candlesticks**

By the size of the candlestick body, you can draw conclusions about how strong sellers and buyers are. The height of a growing candlestick indicates the number of buyers in the market. That is, the higher it is, the more buyers there are. And vice versa. The lower the falling candlestick, the more those who sell. 

The shadows of candlestick can be a signal of loss of strength in the market of sellers or buyers. Let’s consider the following example: there was a growth of a candlestick. However, by the time of the closing of the market, it had fallen and left a large shadow on top. That is, the market was immediately controlled by buyers, but by the close there were more sellers and the price fell.

Thus, Japanese candlesticks help to display the price movement on the chart. However, using only this tool when analyzing the market is unwise, since candlesticks can give false signals. Therefore, traders most often use different types of technical and fundamental analysis tools together. An example of the use of technical analysis and the introduction of artificial intelligence based on it is MonInvAI, which predicts the values of stocks and cryptocurrencies for the future period.",4,,,

Technical analysis,EducatedInvesting,"Introduction to technical analysis: Basic principles, Dow Theory, Price chart","Technical analysis is the study of the past price to predict the price in the future. Meanwhile, various tools are used: indicators, graphical figures, etc. Technical analysis does not search for the reason for price changes, but predicts the most possible change based on information for the previous period.

Technical analysis is used by both investors and traders. An investor can rely only on fundamental analysis, about which we wrote earlier, but at the same time use technical analysis in order to acquire an asset at the most favorable price.

**Basic principles of technical analysis**

1. **The price takes into account everything.** All factors influencing the price have already been taken into account by the market and are reflected in the price. This fact means that from the chart of the price and trading volume, you can get all the information necessary for making a trading decision.
2. **Price movement is dependent on trends.** The market is prone to the formation of certain trends that have a certain duration. The trend can be either growing or falling. The rise or fall depends on the balance of supply and demand. Situations opposite to the trend may also arise. They are called corrections. Also a flat situation when there is no trend can arise in the market. It looks like a horizontal price movement.
3. **History tends to repeat.** The price in the past has been subject to certain changes in certain situations, which means that in the future, in similar situations, the price (the ratio of supply and demand, that is, the behavior of people in the market) is likely to react in a similar way.

The **price chart** is the best indicator of how the market is performing. It is a time-varying line, each point of which reflects information about the price and time of a transaction. Data on prices and trading volume are displayed on the chart based on the selected time interval – timeframe. For example, if the hourly timeframe is selected, the step on the horizontal axis will be equal to one hour.

The graph displays 5 main indicators corresponding to a certain period of time:

* **opening price** is the price at which trading starts
* **closing price** is the price of the last deal
* **maximum price** is the highest transaction price for a certain period of time
* **minimum price** is the lowest transaction price for a certain period of time
* **trading volume** is the number of transactions for a certain period of time

The most important of these indicators is the closing price, as it reflects the bottom line between buyers and sellers. 

**Dow Theory:**

Technical analysis has its origins in a series of articles by Charles Doe, founder of The Wall Street Journal, published in the late 19th century. This theory is considered as an attempt to describe the actions of a person and his psychology through charts and mathematical indicators. Let’s look at the basic principles of Dow Theory.

* Trends, depending on their duration, can be divided into three types:

– primary (long-term, valid for a year or more);

– secondary (medium-term or secondary, fixing movements against the movement of the main market trend);

– small (short-term).

Moreover, all three types of trends can be both growing and falling. According to Dow Theory, in an uptrend, the position of each subsequent peak or decline must be higher than the previous one. In a situation with downtrends, everything should be exactly the opposite.

* The long-term trend is characterized by three phases:

The first is the Accumulation Phase.

Experienced investors buy or sell stocks during this phase, despite the general market behavior (this phase is preceded by an opposite trend). This stage does not last long and is not accompanied by strong price changes.

The second is the Participation Phase.

At the beginning of this phase the so-called active traders with the help of technical analysis catch the beginning of the trend, which was begun by investors with large capital. When making deals, active traders strengthen the trend, which is accompanied by a strong price change.

The third is the Implementation Phase.

At the last stage, all market participants are aware of the current trend. Thus, at the beginning of this phase, some traders open positions in the direction of the trend. When traders assume the end of the trend, they close their positions at a profit.

* The trend must be confirmed by the trading volume.

Trading volume is a required indicator of the existence of a trend. If the price changes along with a small trading volume, then the trend is absent since it does not reflect the opinion of the majority.

* The trend is valid until there is a clear signal of its reversal (closure).

The market itself shows the moment of reversal or closure. This must be checked.

The main function of technical analysis according to Charles Doe is to select the safest and most optimal moments in order to open a deal and make money on speculation on the stock exchange in the long term.

Thus, in this article we got acquainted with the concept of technical analysis and made the main conclusions for ourselves:

* The market is the reaction of its participants, that is it is like an alive mechanism.
* On the charts we see the market balance of supply and demand.
* Technical analysis predicts the most likely change, however in order to succeed, you need to use the entire arsenal of tools.

An example of the use of technical analysis and, on its basis, the implementation of artificial intelligence is MonInvAI, which predicts the values ​​of stocks and cryptocurrencies for the future period.",1,,,

Risk management,EducatedInvesting,"(Guide) What Is Investment Risk, and How Can Investors Manage It?","**Investment risk is the probability of a position delivering lower-than-expected returns. Through risk management, investors can achieve superior returns.** 

[**Read Full Article On The Money Cog**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-investment-risk-and-how-can-investors-manage-it)

Every investment carries risk. And generally speaking, the more risk an investor is willing to take, the higher the potential reward and vice versa. Understanding the investment risk associated with each decision is critical for successful long-term investing. Failing to do this will likely destroy wealth rather than create it.

With that said, let’s explore exactly what risks are associated with investing, the different types, and how to manage them within a portfolio.

# What is investment risk?

Investment risk, or financial risk, is the probability that an investor will achieve less-than-expected returns. If an investment goes particularly badly, a loss may even be incurred. And it can stem from any security including:

* Stocks,
* Bonds,
* Real Estate,
* Derivatives,
* and in sporadic cases, even savings.

The reality is no investment is without risk. Even the highest-rated corporate or even government bond can still default. That’s why financial advisers recommend never investing money that an individual can’t afford to lose.

However, investors aware of the threats their portfolio faces can plan ahead. Therefore, it becomes possible to mitigate the impact of potential risks coming to pass.

# Types of investment risk

The primary types of financial risks investors have to navigate are:

* **Firm-Specific Risk** — Refers to any threat specific to a company, such as a revenue stream dependent on only a handful of customers. These risks can also be industry-specific. For example, a mining company could have operations significantly disrupted if there is a cave-in. Any factor that isn’t considered to be a firm-specific risk, is often classified as systematic risk or market risk.
* **Economic Risk** — An economy suffering a slowdown or a recession can be a challenging environment for businesses to operate in.
* **Interest Rate Risk** — This is the probability of interest rates being hiked by central banks like the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve. Increases in interest rates raise the cost of borrowing money, placing pressure on profit margins as well as the financial health of a business. Interest rate risk is also closely tied to inflation risk as the two entities often move in conjunction.
* **Political Risk** — Principally caused by a change in government which may result in changes. Business decisions made based on the previous government’s policy are affected.
* **Counterparty Risk** — The probability that another party in an agreement, contract, credit, investment, or trading transaction may not keep their word leading to a significant loss.
* **Liquidity Risk** — When referring to a business, liquidity risk is the potential that the firm will have insufficient financial resources to meet its short-term obligations on time. When referring to a security, liquidity risk is the potential for being unable to sell the security in the future as there are no buyers.
* **Concentration Risk** — Investors who keep a large portion of their investment portfolio within a single asset, sector, or country are exposed to concentration risk. If something were to go wrong and the value of these investments refers to the risk associated with having one’s portfolio in a single asset, sector or country.
* **Credit & Default Risk** — This is the risk that a borrower will default in making a necessary payment on a debt to a lender. This risk typically only applies to financial institutions. However, in practice, any business that lends money is exposed to credit risk.
* **Reinvestment Risk** — Refers to the possibility of being unable to reinvest cash flow from a maturing investment at a similar rate of return.
* **Horizon Risk** — This is the risk that an investor’s [time horizon](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-investment-time-horizon) and investment strategy may not match. Sometimes it could be cut short due to job loss or other emergencies.
* **Longevity Risk** — This is the risk that an individual may live longer than expected, resulting in insufficient funds to maintain a desired lifestyle.
* **Foreign Investment Risk** — Refers to the risks involved with international markets, such as foreign policy or fluctuating currency exchange rates. The latter is also often referred to as currency risk.

# What are “risk-free” investments?

The term risk-free investment is used to describe a group of securities that have extremely low probabilities of failing. Investors often use them to reduce the total risk associated with an investment portfolio through diversification.

Typically, the securities within this category include:

* Government Bonds.
* Treasury Bills.
* UK Gilts.
* Certificates of Deposits.
* Savings.

Despite the name, even these securities still carry a level of risk. Governments can default on their loans, and banks can go bankrupt. Even savings protected by depositor insurance can disappear if the amount stored in a bank account exceeds the insurance threshold of £85,000.

# Risk vs reward

As previously mentioned, there is generally a trade-off between risk and reward. In most cases, the higher the risk associated with an investment, the higher the potential return. This is why securities such as [junk bonds](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-high-yield-investments) and [penny stocks](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-penny-stocks-and-are-they-a-good-investment) are still immensely popular despite having high-risk profiles.

Everyone has a different tolerance for investment risk. As such, investment strategies need to reflect this [risk tolerance](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-risk-tolerance-and-why-is-it-important-for-investors) and keep a portfolio balanced in the context of the individual investor.

# How to measure investment risk

Despite being a critical piece in the world of investing, measuring risk can be tricky. Most quantitative methods used by professionals today are measures of asset price volatility. While this can provide helpful and actionable insight, it’s far from perfect, especially for thinly traded asset classes.

For example, a rare collectable may have a relatively stable price (thus low volatility), but finding an interested buyer could be challenging.

Nevertheless, the most popular methods of measuring risk/volatility include the following:

* **Standard Deviation** — This tool measures the historical volatility of an investment compared to its annual return. It shows how stable an asset could be. Less stable investments are known to have higher risks. Subsequently, [small-cap stocks](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-small-cap-stocks-and-are-they-good-investments) typically have a higher standard deviation than stable [large-cap stocks](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-are-large-cap-stocks-and-are-they-a-good-investment).
* **Sharpe Ratio** — This metric measures the balance between risk and expected return on an investment or portfolio. The higher the value, the better.
* **Beta** — Measures the degree to how closely an asset price will move in relation to a stock market index. A value of 1.0 means the security will match the performance of the market. A value of 2.0 means that every time the market increases by 1%, the security will increase by 2% and vice versa. Beta values can also be negative, indicating that the security will move in the opposite direction of the market.
* **Value at Risk (VaR)** — Measures the level of risk an investment a company or portfolio is exposed to. Through this tool, a company could measure the maximum loss it could have.

# How to manage investment risk.

Risk management is vital to every successful investment. No wonder Warren Buffett’s investment rules are,

1. Never lose money.
2. Never forget Rule #1.

An investor must know how to manage investment risks within their portfolio. Fortunately, there are various methods where that can be achieved.

* **Diversification** — This is arguably one of the most popular and arguably most potent risk management strategies within an investor’s toolkit. For stocks, the idea is to own various high-quality businesses across multiple industries and geographies. That way, should one position suffer a loss, the impact on the overall portfolio is mitigated by the other uncorrelated investments.
* **Pound Cost Averaging** — During periods of stock market volatility, spreading buying activity over several weeks and months can mitigate the risk of suffering large unexpected downturns. It also ensures that capital remains available to capitalise on any adverse movements to bolster a position in a high-quality asset caught in the crossfire.
* **Invest Long Term** — In the long term, the stock market generally appreciates in value. Obviously, not every stock can deliver positive returns. However, by focusing on the long run, investors can largely ignore short-term risks and perhaps even capitalise on the volatility they create.
* **Options & Derivatives** — As an investor seeks to diversify portfolios, options and derivatives could be used as part of a hedging strategy. However, options and derivatives require skill and expertise to use correctly. A novice investor with limited knowledge of financial derivatives can potentially suffer enormous losses far greater than the initial amount invested. That’s why these securities are typically reserved for professionals.

# The bottom line

Investment risks are intrinsic to every form of investment. However, the risk levels differ from investment to investment. While risk cannot be avoided entirely, it can be minimised. And by implementing proper risk management tools, investors can potentially reap significant returns while keeping risk in check.

Risk management,EducatedInvesting,(Guide) Passive Investing Strategies: A Beginner’s Guide,"**Passive investing strategies allow investors to build wealth over time with minimal effort. Discover the pros and cons of this approach.** 

[**Read Full Article on The Money Cog**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/passive-investing-strategies-a-beginners-guide)

Passive investing strategies seek to maximise investment returns by trading as little as possible. Instead of actively buying and selling securities, passive investors adopt a buy-and-hold approach. And for those not interested in learning [how to pick stocks](https://themoneycog.com/articles/how-to-pick-stocks-to-invest-in) for the long term, [index investing](https://themoneycog.com/articles/index-investing) is one of the most popular passive investing strategies.

# Characteristics of passive investing strategies

At the heart of every passive investing strategy lies the [investment goal](https://themoneycog.com/articles/how-to-define-investment-goals-in-5-easy-steps) of building wealth steadily over time while ignoring short-term opportunities. There are some differences between the various methods available. However, some common characteristics across all forms include:

* **Long-Term Outlook** — Passive investors seek to capitalise on the long-term upward trend of the stock market. Therefore, they operate with long [investment time horizons](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-investment-time-horizon).
* **Diversified Portfolio** — While the stock market generally trends upward over time, not every business survives the journey. Therefore, a portfolio needs to be well diversified to absorb and mitigate the damage of one or more positions failing to meet expectations. [Index funds](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-index-fund-and-how-do-they-work) are incredibly popular among passive investors since they provide instant diversification within a single transaction.
* **Lower Risk Profile** — While it’s impossible to eliminate all investment risks, the potential adverse impact of firm-specific threats can be mitigated through diversification. Therefore, passive investors are typically exposed to a lower risk profile than active investors.
* **Low Costs** — The buy-and-hold philosophy of passive investors results in far fewer transactions versus an active trader. As such, the amount of money spent on commissions and transaction fees is significantly lower. Furthermore, long-term investments are taxed less than short-term trades in some countries, resulting in additional tax savings.
* **Dividends** — While not a requirement, stocks popular with passive investors often provide a stream of passive income through dividends.

# Types of passive investments

Several types of securities and tools are available for investors to adopt passive investing strategies.

* **Index Fund** — As previously mentioned, index funds are one of the most popular passive wealth-building methods.Investors can buy shares in a low-cost passive mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund designed to track a particular index. In the UK, some of the most popular indices include the [**FTSE 100**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-ftse-100-and-how-does-it-work) and [**FTSE 250**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-ftse-250-and-how-does-it-work), whereas, in the United States, the [**S&P 500**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-the-sp-500-and-how-does-it-work) is often the go-to option. However, there are more focused fund options that track specific sectors or commodities that can cater to different investor risk tolerances.
* **Real Estate** — Investing in rental property can provide a steady monthly income stream. However, raising capital for this type of investment can be challenging and expensive. Not to mention, dealing with tenants can sometimes require more active involvement. Fortunately, there is a hands-off alternative. Investors can instead buy shares in a [Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)](https://themoneycog.com/articles/how-to-invest-in-real-estate-investment-trusts-in-the-uk), which invests shareholder capital into real estate and returns the rental income as dividends.
* **Investment Adviser** — For individuals with a higher net worth, hiring an [investment adviser](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-investment-adviser-and-do-i-need-one) to manage an investment portfolio is an alternative hands-off approach to building wealth.
* **Robo**–**Adviser** — For individuals with a lower net worth, [robo-advisers](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-automatic-rebalancing-and-how-does-it-work) are becoming increasingly popular. These automated investing algorithms manage an investor’s assets based on their investment goals and risk tolerance.

# Advantages of passive investing strategies

While passive investing is often a more boring method of building wealth, it does come with some significant advantages.

* **Simple & Low Effort** — The stock market is a complicated wealth-building mechanism that can quickly destroy wealth when mistakes are made. Learning how to pick stocks, analyse market trends, and forecast future returns requires in-depth knowledge that individuals may be unable or unwilling to spend time learning. And yet, these challenges can be almost entirely bypassed by using a passive strategy, letting both novice and experienced investors build wealth without having to provide much oversight or portfolio management.
* **Low Cost** — As previously mentioned, investing passively incurs fewer transactions, reducing the investment fees paid each year.
* **Transparent** — Most passive investing vehicles provide enormous transparency where capital is invested. Mutual funds disclose which types of securities they invest in, what sectors they’re exposed to, and how diversified their portfolios are. This makes it incredibly easy for investors to know exactly where their money is being allocated and how much risk they’re exposed to.
* Tax Efficient — Every country has different tax treatments for capital gains. However, positions that are held longer than 12 months are taxed more generously than investments held for shorter periods.

# Disadvantages of passive investing strategies

As powerful as the advantages of passive investing can be, it’s not without drawbacks.

* **Limited Choice** — The stock market is home to thousands of publically traded companies. However, the vast majority are unsuitable for passive investing strategies. The same applies to most asset types that cannot be used in a passive portfolio. This limits the number of choices a passive investor has when deciding where to invest their money.
* **Limited Returns** — Since passive investors aren’t actively picking individual stocks, the maximum returns an investor can achieve are limited. For those investing in an index fund, generating the market-beating returns that picking individual stocks can provide is impossible.
* **Limited Control** — When investing through passive funds or trusts, investors have next to no control over where their money ends up being invested. For example, buying shares in a FTSE 100 exchange-traded fund is equivalent to indirectly investing in each of the UK’s top 100 companies. However, if there are some specific companies an investor doesn’t want to own, such as tobacco stocks, there is no way to exclude them.

# Passive vs active investing strategies

The general approach of passive investing strategies is to mirror the stock market’s performance. By comparison, active investing strategies seek to outperform the stock market and achieve higher returns to accelerate the wealth-building process.

Active investors have far more control over their capital. But it comes at the cost of effort. Investors deploying active management strategies must perform all necessary research, risk analysis, and portfolio management. While investors can choose to buy shares in active mutual funds, historically, these investment vehicles have failed to deliver market-beating returns after deducting management fees.

Needless to say, active management is a far more time-consuming process. Services like [**The Money Cog Premium**](https://themoneycog.com/) can significantly cut down the research time in the search for top-notch stocks. However, a passive strategy may be more suitable for investors unable or unwilling to spend time actively managing their investment portfolios.

# Alternative Investing Strategies

The stock market is a giant sandbox. And there are far more alternative investment strategies that investors can adopt to build wealth. Investors should spend time researching and exploring each option to find the most suitable strategy for their personal circumstances.

* **Active** — Investors seek to outperform the stock market by picking individual stocks and capitalising on short-term trends.
* **Momentum** — Investors focus on stock price momentum rather than underlying fundamentals. Decisions are made solely based on price action and trading volume.
* **Value** — This investing strategy involves buying securities trading at prices below their estimated intrinsic value.
* **Growth** — This investment strategy involves investing in companies, industries, and sectors that are growing and are expected to grow significantly in the future.
* **Small-Cap** — Focuses on smaller businesses that aren’t as widely followed by financial institutions. This region of the stock market can often be riskier. However, it’s also where some terrific undervalued long-term growth opportunities can be discovered.
* **Dividend** — Investors focus solely on businesses that provide a stable dividend to shareholders to build a portfolio that generates a reliable stream of passive income.
* **ESG** — This strategy exclusively considers companies that score highly on environmental and societal responsibility scales as determined by independent firms and research groups.
* **Factor** — This investment strategy focuses on assets based on certain characteristics that have been proven to outperform over long time horizons.

# Should I use a passive investing strategy?

Passive investing strategies are immensely popular due to their simplicity and hands-off management requirements. However, that doesn’t necessarily make it a suitable option for all investors.

Passive investing requires a monumental amount of patience and the ability not to panic during [stock market crashes](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-stock-market-crash-and-what-causes-them) and [corrections](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-stock-market-correction-and-what-causes-them). The latter is often easier said than done. And naturally impatient individuals will likely struggle to build wealth using a passive investing strategy.

That’s why it’s important for investors to explore all the available options to decide which one is best for their personal circumstances.

# The bottom line

Passive investing is beneficial for investors who have a long-term approach. It is low cost, low effort, and provides an easy solution to replicating the stock market’s average returns. However, it also has some drawbacks. Total gains can be limited, and investors often have limited choices and control over their investment portfolios.

Risk management,EducatedInvesting,How PAMM Accounts Work,"PAMM accounts as a financial instrument for investing in the FOREX market is a relatively young phenomenon that appeared around 2006. This tool helps investors to forget about self-Forex trading for a while. Capital operations are carried out by an experienced manager who receives a certain part of the profit for the services rendered.

In simple terms, a PAMM account is a special trader’s account in which an unlimited number of investors can invest money. The manager’s trading profit is distributed in proportion to the deposits. In terms of their functionality and profitability PAMM accounts can be compared with shares in various mutual funds, in fact, with trust management of funds.

Modern PAMM accounts connect traders with investors, allowing both parties to earn money. You transfer your funds to an experienced specialist and receive income from the investment without leaving your home and without making any effort. Profitability can range from 3 to 40% per month, which gives very serious figures on an annualized basis.

To start investing in PAMM accounts you need to study the ranking of managers in a special table. There you can choose the most successful traders based on the indicators.

**How to choose a PAMM account**

If you have money, but you still lack experience for independent work on Forex, investing in one or better several PAMM accounts of more experienced traders is the best option. At first you need to study the effectiveness of potential manager of your money using an independent ranking of managers.

It is necessary to study at least six months of manager’s trading on Forex:

* The average monthly profitability of a PAMM account of 10-20% is considered as a good indicator. And the ratio of transactions that generate income to unprofitable transactions should be at least 60/40%.
* The average acceptable loss rate is 5% of the size of the PAMM account, no more.
* The riskiness of a trader’s behavior can be determined by the ratio of the number of open lots (contracts) per deal (order) to the size of the PAMM account: it is reckless to place more than one lot in one currency for every $10,000.

When investing in PAMM accounts, pay attention to those managers who use stop losses. If there is no limit on the level of loss, there is a risk of losing the entire deposit in one deal even when investing in PAMMs. It is better to forget about using the martingale (increasing the volume of the transaction covering up the resulting losses). This strategy is often chosen by novice traders or managers who have not found a suitable trading system.

You need to invest on reliable, responsible and reputable PAMM platforms, where you will not have problems with depositing or withdrawing funds, and you will receive a high service of information and technical support.

**Monitoring of PAMM accounts**

The best way to make money on PAMM accounts is to form a portfolio in which your funds will be distributed among several managers. Thanks to a more cautious strategy, potential risks will be significantly reduced. The yield graph will be more stable.  
PAMM accounts are a good way to invest in Forex by investing a small part of capital to work with high-yield and high-risk instruments. However, the investor takes 100% of the risk of his investment. In other words, the manager does not limit the risks of investors. But investors have learned to reduce all risks to zero by investing in 10-15 or more PAMM accounts. Also, if you have investment capital, for example, $10,000, it is not recommended to invest it in PAMMs in full. Investments in more conservative instruments should be 50-70% of the amount. The remaining 10-30% can be distributed among aggressive instruments, including PAMM accounts.

**How to invest in a PAMM account**

Action plan:

* Broker selection and registration
* Choosing a PAMM account – compare the performance of traders in the ranking of PAMM accounts and choose the best
* Investment
* Withdrawal of profit – you can withdraw only profit, part of it, part of the entire deposit or the entire deposit – that is, any amount at any time.

You can start investing in PAMM accounts with $10, but for portfolio investments it is better to have $200-300 on your account. Thus, pamm accounts are one of the available investment methods. It helps you save time, not to distract and control. However, it is always worth to remember about portfolio diversification, since using only one instrument is unwise. It’s also cool to make decisions yourself and invest in the long term, for instance with the help of MonInvAI, which predicts the values of stocks and cryptocurrencies. The platform is an example of the use of both technical analysis and fundamental, and on their basis the introduction of artificial intelligence.

Risk management,EducatedInvesting,The Easy Way To Find Good Stocks," 

In April of this year, Google announced another big stock buyback to the toon of $70 billion worth. It’s a healthy business that continues to reward shareholders for risking their money on the company. That seems to be the way of the world and the people wise enough to own shares of the tech giant are already up 20% this year, but the vote-mongers are wagging their crooked little fingers.

It should be taxed, the ones who have been around for a while demand. Indeed, Biden has taxed buybacks So now Uncle Sam profits from these deals.

That squares nicely with the talk from Washington and the people who want to clamp down on buybacks even more. But, what does it all mean for us?

Risk management,EducatedInvesting,"Guide: What is automatic rebalancing, and how does it work?","Automatic rebalancing is a relatively new technique in the financial industry to help keep risk in check. The value of investments is constantly in a state of flux. And over time, the balance between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes within a portfolio can shift drastically.

Investment strategies often define a strict set of ratios between asset classes. These ratios are commonly referred to as target asset allocation.

A more aggressive growth portfolio will likely have a higher proportion of stocks to bonds, while a conversation approach would be the opposite. Professionally-managed investment portfolios are rebalanced regularly. And as the name suggests, automatic rebalancing automates this process.

[**Originally Published on The Money Cog**](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-automatic-rebalancing-and-how-does-it-work)

# What is automatic portfolio rebalancing?

Automatic rebalancing is offered by many trading platforms and [brokerage accounts](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-investment-account-and-how-do-i-open-one) today. Using algorithmically-based software, the allocation of different asset classes within a portfolio can be automatically realigned at a specified interval — typically once per year. This can be pretty convenient for individuals with limited time or investing knowledge and further helps put investments on autopilot.

Traditionally, portfolio rebalancing is done manually based on recommendations offered by a [financial adviser](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-investment-adviser-and-do-i-need-one). But hiring a professional to manage an investment portfolio can be quite expensive. Robo-advisers, on the other hand, are a far cheaper alternative and offer automated portfolio rebalancing solutions, usually by default.

But why is rebalancing important in the first place?

It all comes down to risk. A conservative investor close to retirement may have a portfolio comprising 30% stocks and 70% bonds. But after a stock market rally, the value of their shares increased drastically. That’s obviously good news, but it’s also shifted the balance between bonds and stocks.

Shares now represent 40% of the overall portfolio, resulting in a higher risk profile beyond the limits of the original investment strategy.

To rebalance the asset mix and bring risk levels back down, the investor can either invest new capital into bonds or take profits from their equity returns and invest the proceeds into bonds. The objective is to return the balance back down to the original asset allocation or to a renewed target allocation.

Through automatic rebalancing, this entire process is handled by a computer, allowing the investor to focus on other things.

# How does this strategy work?

When it comes to rebalancing an investment portfolio, there are three primary methods available to investors:

* **Manual Rebalancing** — An investment manager is hired to keep track of the ratio between asset classes in an investment portfolio. They design a rebalancing strategy and advise on which positions to divest or bolster in exchange for a fee that typically lies around 1% of an investor’s portfolio value per year.
* **DIY Rebalancing** — An individual Investor can decide to rebalance without an investment adviser’s help and rely on their own research and judgement to make decisions. While this avoids paying any fees to a professional, it requires skill and emotional discipline that many investors don’t possess. A badly rebalanced portfolio can significantly underperform over the long term. Therefore DIY investing is typically not recommended for novice investors with next-to-no experience.
* **Rebalancing Investments** — Instead of picking individual stocks and bonds, investors can invest in a [mutual fund](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-a-mutual-fund) or [exchange-traded fund](https://themoneycog.com/articles/what-is-an-etf-and-how-do-they-work), where the fund manager makes all the rebalancing decisions on their behalf. For example, target-date funds constantly rebalance to account for an investor’s age.
* **Automatic Rebalancing** — The rebalancing decisions are executed based on a trading algorithm. Automatic rebalancing is usually an optional premium service that charges a small fee proportionate to the size of an investor portfolio. Typically the charges for this service sit around 0.5% of an investor’s portfolio value per year, making it a cheaper alternative to hiring an investment manager.

# What are the advantages of automatic rebalancing?

While automatic rebalancing may not be suitable for everyone, it does offer some noteworthy advantages.

* **Removes Emotion** — Emotions are removed from the equation by keeping the process automatic. This prevents the risk of falling into an emotional investing trap and better protects wealth.
* **Maintains Diversification** — As an asset class grows and shrinks within an investment portfolio, diversification can be adversely affected. Through automatic rebalancing, this no longer poses an issue.
* **Stays The Course** — Rebalancing asset allocation ensures an investment strategy remains on track, delivering on the [investment goals](https://themoneycog.com/articles/how-to-define-investment-goals-in-5-easy-steps), time horizon, and risk tolerance of an investor.
* **No Knowledge Requirements** — Investors don’t need to know how to rebalance their portfolios manually, as a trading algorithm makes all the decisions on their behalf.
* **Investing Autopilot** — Investors don’t need to think about rebalancing, as the process is completed automatically.
* **Low Fees** — Automatic rebalancing is typically cheaper than hiring an investment adviser to rebalance a portfolio manually.

# What are the disadvantages of automatic rebalancing?

As advantageous and cost-effective as automatic rebalancing may be, there are some significant drawbacks for investors to consider.

* **No Human Input** — All investment decisions are made by a computer, typically with next-to-no human intervention. For investors trying to understand why certain decisions are being made, it may be impossible to get an answer by paying for professional help.
* **No Control** — Beyond some general outlines, investors typically have no say in where their capital is reallocated.
* **Contradicts Buy & Hold Investing** — Buy & hold investors don’t typically use aggressive rebalancing techniques as they operate with longer time horizons. Using automatic rebalancing may result in a position being sold against the investor’s will.
* **Clips Winning Investments** — A stock that has surged to new heights is likely to be targeted by an automatic rebalancing algorithm as the position becomes a larger chunk of the overall portfolio. However, it’s possible that the shares may be set to surge even higher in the long term. And by selling shares today, the investor misses out on all the additional future growth.
* **More Transaction Costs** — Unlike manual rebalancing, automatic rebalancing is a constant process that will activate as soon as a portfolio deviates from the specified target asset allocation. During a period of heightened market volatility, this can trigger a significantly higher level of transactions resulting in higher commission and trading costs.

# The bottom line

The financial markets are constantly moving up and down. And this volatility can often cause a portfolio to veer off track. Automatic rebalancing helps correct this potential portfolio problem, reducing risk exposure with minimal effort required by the investor.

However, rebalancing a portfolio too frequently can quickly rack up additional costs while undermining its long-term performance. Investors need to weigh the pros and cons before using this type of service or platform feature.

Market trends,EducatedInvesting,PMET Boosts James Bay Potential With Newest Discovery + PMET 2.0 Opportunity in Arctic Fox Lithium (AFX.c)?,"**With the new discovery at Patriot Battery Metals (PMET, 1.30B mcap) Corvette Lithium property, hitting \~100m of near-continuous-bearing pegmatite at CV9, located \~14km west of the CV5 pegmatite which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2M tonnes at 1.42% lithium oxide.**

This marks the latest of many significant discoveries coming out of the James Bay Region in Quebec, which has recently made a name for itself as a significant hub for active lithium projects with the largest lithium pegmatite mineral resource in the Americas and boosts the potential of the entire district.

**Holding three lithium projects in the James Bay Region, all of which are located in close proximity to PMET's discovery,  Arctic Fox Lithium (AFX.c) stands out as an early-stage and undervalued junior mineral exploration firm with assets located in the world's most prolific area for lithium discoveries.** 

https://preview.redd.it/suruifsejz1c1.png?width=2282&format=png&auto=webp&s=93c04094763fd09f74c575e272e2035d4d6f0cd9

Having successfully wrapped up Phase 1 exploration at all three of its James Bay Lithium Projects, incoming assays are poised to strengthen AFX's position in the industry, as discussed by President and CEO Harry Chew on Stocks to Watch: [https://youtu.be/Xr0ziOpW9EM?si=wxPCrJVC-v\_YU2Sq](https://youtu.be/Xr0ziOpW9EM?si=wxPCrJVC-v_YU2Sq)

Once received, AFX will be using the sample and assay results to plan for its second phase of exploration on these properties.

**AFX's Delta Lake, Kana Lake and Pontax North Projects all have favourable regional geological settings, close proximity to LCT pegmatite occurrences and deposits, and the potential for LCT pegmatites with multiple preliminary targets already outlined.**

Demonstrating their immense potential, AFX's Delta Lake and Pontax North Projects are both located in close proximity Allkem (AKE, 8.5B Market Cap) as well as Critical Elements Lithium (CRE, 359.35M Market Cap) Rose Property where excellent lithium grades were returned, identifying several lithium-tantalum pegmatite trends including two kilometre long trends hosting multiple lithium, caesium and tantalum anomalies. 

**Most notable, however, is AFX's Kana Lake which, situated the closest to PMET's Corvette Project and CV5 Pegmatite, has over 10 pegmatites including one substantial formation reaching over 500 meters and extending for over 2 kilometres, exhibiting substantial potential for new discoveries and growth.**

Market trends,EducatedInvesting,Analysts estimate,"For investors, one of the tried and true investing strategies has been to find out where the puck is going, not where it currently is. This means being able to accurately identify growing market trends and investing in industries before they hit it big. Recent examples include the electric vehicle sector and cryptocurrencies. The plant-based food industry flies under most investors' radars, but it is chock-full of companies that are trying to solve the vegetarian and food sustainability conundrums. To clarify, the plant-based food industry does not refer to all plants used for food; rather, it refers to the replacement of meat and other animal-based food products with plant-based alternatives.

Seasonal factors are expected to play a bigger role in the price action of gold, resulting in an extremely bullish outlook as gold continues to shine as a strong hedge against economic uncertainty and a safe haven investment. (Source: [https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-11-23/Gold-prices-below-2-000-but-seasonals-remain-favorable.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-11-23/Gold-prices-below-2-000-but-seasonals-remain-favorable.html)) 

**Boasting a 'first-class acquisition that ""couldn't be created today with less than $700M"" according to billionaire mining investor Frank Giustra, West Red Lake Gold Mines (WRLG.v WRLGF) is one junior gold company with significant potential.**

WRLG's flagship Madsen Mine has a gold resource of 6.9M tons indicated and 1.8M tons inferred in Ontario's Red Lake Gold District, with the latest drill results intersecting 27.15g/t Au over 10.28m and 22.31 g/t Au over 8.5m at its debt-free and fully permitted mine. 

https://preview.redd.it/22krf5rxic2c1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bf1ba2a3e0c1edb93e22754b868670b2af15d24

The first round of drill results from the Madsen Mine were drilled from underground on the North Austin Zone, a new area of high-grade mineralization, expanding the resource to the northeast. 

Sitting adjacent to the existing underground development, the zone is a high-caliber target that could potentially be developed early during future mine restart and production as it remains open down-dip and along strike to the northeast and will continue to be a priority expansion target as underground drilling continues.

Believing these intercepts are indicative of the exceptional resource growth potential that still exists at the asset, Shane Williams, WRLG President & CEO, stated:

>""We are very encouraged by this first round of results out from the underground drilling campaign at the Madsen Mine. Our geologic team quickly recognized the exploration potential in the North Austin area, which represents a high-grade expansion target that sits very close to existing underground infrastructure. While a good portion of the underground drill meters will continue to be focused on definition and increasing confidence in the current resource, we will continue to take advantage of near-mine organic growth opportunities that could materially enhance and increase the mineral resource inventory at Madsen.” 

**This news follows WRLG's previous significant step forward in de-risking its high-grade resource following additional positive metallurgical test results from its Rowan Mine Deposit, deeming the Rowan Deposit to be a future source of high-grade, easily recoverable gold ounces that could potentially add a significant boost to the overall production profile at Madsen.**

**As detailed in the Economist Global in an article titled ""What Does Alaska Energy Metals’ Nickel Find Mean for the Mining Industry?"", Alaska Energy Metals' (AEMC.v AKEMF) latest nickel discovery is significant as it ""not only highlights the potential of the Nikolai Nickel Project but also underlines the importance of Alaska as a key player in the global mining landscape."":** [https://www.economistglobal.com/what-does-alaska-energy-metals-nickel-find-mean-for-the-mining-industry/](https://www.economistglobal.com/what-does-alaska-energy-metals-nickel-find-mean-for-the-mining-industry/) 

Recently, **AEMC intersected 317.2 m grading 0.34% nickel equivalent and confirmed mineralization along 860m of strike length** \- a compelling indicator of the areas profitability and viability for mining operations. The Eureka Zone is now known for its extensive mineralization, providing a testament to the geological richness of the Nikolai Nickel Project

Alaska Energy Metals President & CEO Gregory Beischer commented: 

>“These two holes further increase the drilled strike extent of the Eureka Zone to 860m. With results from the remaining two drill holes anticipated soon, we can begin calculating an updated Inferred Resource and complete metallurgical studies. Drilling results are consistent with historical drill holes, which intermittently trace out a strike extent of more than 10 kilometers for the mineralized zone. The nickel–copper sulfide mineralization is remarkably homogeneous.”

AEMC's Nikolai Nickel Project boasts a resource exceeding 1.5B pounds of nickel, 372M pounds of copper and 115M pounds of cobalt as detailed in the Maiden NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate and is ""quickly evolving into one of the largest nickel resources on the continent"".

**Additionally, the innovative exploration technique uses artificial intelligence and machine learning for mineral exploration, from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund supported by Gates, Michael Bloomberg, Bezos, and Dalio.**

On track to hit a resource growth target of reaching multiple billions of pounds of in situ 0.35% NiEq within 18 months, AEMC is advancing the project with an aggressive, multi-drill approach, including up to 4 drill rigs moving next season.  

""Symbolizing a potential paradigm shift in the nickel mining industry,"" the Nikolai Nickel Project is poised to become a significant contributor to the economy and, as a domestic source of critical minerals, it reduced reliance on foreign imports, strengthening national economic security.

Economic indicators,EducatedInvesting,"DXY, what is it and why does it matter?","Hey All, 

Last Monday I wrote a post on DXY and its increased relevance across the broader market for a different venue and it  has received quite a bit of positive feedback. Since the DXY bounce I flagged in the original post is now playing out while the broader market comes under some downward pressures (SPY, BTC, GOLD), so I figured that I would share the post more broadly. All of the data below is still relevant as it was generally deduced from high timeframe analysis and indicators on 1 week candles. 

Here is an updated read on the 1day DXY chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/QvAepy9](https://imgur.com/gallery/QvAepy9)

The rest of the post begins below.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I hope everyone is having a fantastic start to the New Year! I wanted my first post to be orientated towards a macro consideration that I think will continue to stay relevant throughout 2021.That brings into focus the title of the post: ""DXY, what is it and why does it matter?""

**What is DXY?**

DXY is the U.S. Dollar Index and it is an index of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies (the ""Basket Currencies""). Simply put, DXY goes up when the U.S. dollar gains strength relative to the Basket Currencies and conversely goes down when the U.S. dollar loses strength in comparison to the Basket Currencies.For those that are curious, the composition and weight of the Basket Currencies is:

* Euro (EUR), 57.6% weight
* Japanese Yen (JPY), 13.6% weight
* Pound Sterling (GBP), 11.9% weight
* Canadian Dollar (CAD), 9.1% weight
* Swedish Krona (SEK), 4.2% weight
* Swiss franc (CHF), 3.6% weight

My background is in technical analysis, so it's worth mentioning some of the limitations inherent within DXY for higher timeframe macro analysis:

* DXY was created in 1967, so when looking at DXY on very high timeframe candles (1 year candles, quarterly candles) not all of the higher exponential moving averages (ema's) and simple moving averages (sma's) will be populated. E.g., you would need 200 years of price action to get a 200 ema on a 1 year candle time frame.
* The composition of the Basket Currencies has only been altered once when the Euro was created at the start of 1999. As a result, some economists feel that the Basket Currencies are overdue for an update to more accurately reflect the current state of global economic affairs. E.g., China, Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea are currently not included in the Basket Currencies.

**Why does DXY Matter?**

Dollar strength and rate of inflation have always been a worthwhile consideration when analyzing stocks, commodities, and other assets, but 2020 has brought about a perfect storm of sorts where DXY has become increasingly relevant.The forces that elevated DXY to it's heightened relevance are:

1. Extremely low interest rates, which encourage greater risk appetites in the search for returns on capital.
2. Inflationary concerns related to the Covid-19 and subsequent fiscal stimulus undertaken by Congress and the Fed.
   1. M2 has never increased by such a significant percentage.

* M2 Background:
   * M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money.
   * M2 is a broader measure of the money supply than M1, which just includes cash and checking deposits.
   * M2 is **closely watched as an indicator of money supply and future inflation**, and as a target of central bank monetary policy.

For example, in 2008 during the ""Great Recession/Financial Crisis"" M2 increased by roughly 10%. In contrast, M2 in 2020 increased by approximately 25%.

1. *See* **M2 Chart**: [https://imgur.com/gallery/H4Gqo7B](https://imgur.com/gallery/H4Gqo7B)

Traditionally, some of the best hedges against inflation are stocks, real estate, treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), and gold and other commodities. In essence, things that are actively priced and traded in dollars will generally accrue in value as the dollar weakens through inflation.In the current economic environment, the perfect storm developed because there is an increasing concern that substantial inflation may be beginning to take place. This inflationary concern is further compounded by there being very little opportunity for decent returns on ""risk free"" money such as FDIC insured deposits and Treasury Bonds. The Fed's general policy is targeting a 2% rate of inflation. However, given the current unprecedented monetary environment it is unknown what the sizable increase in M2 will actually mean for that target rate. If the inflationary rate greatly exceeds 2%, institutions and individuals with massive holdings will be left potentially scrambling to figure out where to park all their money in order to hedge against inflation.Lastly, the above concepts regarding DXY's relevance to the market is further bolstered when one looks at a Correlation Coefficient for DXY vs SPX and BTC.

* *See* **DXY Correlation Coefficient data**: [https://imgur.com/gallery/4gzD8Cm](https://imgur.com/gallery/4gzD8Cm)

The above shows a correlation coefficient for DXY vs the S&P 500 and BTC/USD. A correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two assets or variables. The values range between -1.0 (extremely inversely correlated) to 1.0 (extremely correlated). Therefore, a correlation of -1.0 shows a perfect negative correlation while a correlation of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the movement of the two assets.The DXY Correlation Coefficient data shows that DXY is inversely correlated to the S&P 500 at a measure of -0.92 (with -1.0 being a perfect inverse correlation). Meanwhile, the data shows that DXY is inversely correlated with BTC/USD at a measure of -0.88. Surprisingly, it would therefore be reasonable to deduce that DXY going down has a higher impact on the S&P 500 going up than even on BTC/USD increasing in value.**Some Long Term Technical Analysis on DXY**As the 1 month DXY chart below shows, 2020 was a pretty wild year for DXY. DXY broke through a multi-year diagonal trendline and then subsequently re-tested the breakdown area and was rejected. Thereafter, DXY failed to hold above several key horizontal support levels as it continued to weaken into the end of 2020.

* *See* **DXY 1 month candles chart w/ relevant trendlines and horizontal supports**: [https://imgur.com/gallery/wJaIOEU](https://imgur.com/gallery/wJaIOEU)

In addition, there are further troubling signs for the next year for DXY in that bearish crosses are occurring on relevant exponential moving averages (I flagged the 21 ema and 50 ema cross), while historical volatility percentile is also expanding to the upside. However, 1 month stochastics are very low in the range and the negative slope on the RSI has begun to flatten out, hinting that DXY may not just plummet to the center of the earth tomorrow.

* *See* **DXY 1 month candles chart w/ indicators:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/4MVpP7K](https://imgur.com/gallery/4MVpP7K)

On lower time frames from 1 week to 1 day, the indicators are suggesting that DXY may indeed attempt a short term bounce attempt. Relevant targets for such a bounce attempt are 90.468, 90.976, 91.43, and 92.237. If the bounce does play out I would expect there to be resulting downward pressure across equities until DXY resumes its downward trajectory. A daily close on DXY below the 89.0 level would invalidate this short term bounce attempt.

* *See* **DXY 1 day chart w/ indicators suggesting potential bounce may be coming:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/vCSMnwq](https://imgur.com/gallery/vCSMnwq)

Thanks for the read and I hope the above was helpful in learning a bit about DXY and its increased relevance across the broader markets!",33,"Great post! Couple of quick comments/questions. 

Didn’t Fed say they are okay with inflation >2% in order to catch up on years with low inflation? If this is true, then we are likely to enter a higher inflation environment relative to recent years. Thoughts?

I might be misunderstanding your phrasing for the correlation. Are you saying the correlation between DXY and SPY or BTC is the coefficient? (If DXY goes down 1 then SPY goes up .92?)",I learned something new today. Thank you!,

Trading strategy,StockMarket,My AI momentum trading journey just started. Dumping $3k into an automated trading strategy guided by ChatGPT. Am I gonna make it,"As a major lurker, I’ve seen quite a few of these “Trading journey” posts and I decided that I might as well jump in the fire with my very own take.

The weather is just about brewing with enough chaos that we might see a decent tailwind across AI stocks within the next few months. I intend to ride the hypecycle with a an automated AI strategy to capture as much upside value as possible.

**A few things that make me believe the AI hype cycle is just getting started:**

**The Fed’ning**

* Government expenditure in relation to GDP will continue to increase This isn’t just a US phenomena, Nation states worldwide are increasing government expediture and reach.(Chipps act, various AI accessibility and regulatory acts). A good portion of this will trickle down into the market cap of bluechip co’s with big AI departments ready for big ol entreprise contracts.

**The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement**

* On this, I can single out an event that most people are sleeping on. The US food supply chain is about to undergo massive digital transformation with FSMA (The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ). Think big data lakes and lots of machine learning having to be adopted at gunpoint in unseen rates all across the food supply chain.

**Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets**

* AI tech has been commoditized, can be forked, API called, build on top of. Its pretty fluid and easy to access. As I type this, there’s tens of thousands of AI startups across all imaginable industries getting past product-market-fit hurdles, opening distribution channels, and ultimately expanding the AI global total addressable market . This early stage innovation will trickle down into public markets in record time. Wait a few months.

**My AI investment strategy - AI investing in AI (kinda “quirky” huh?)**

To create my strategy I asked an AI tool “Can you create a momentum trading strategy focused on AI-focused stocks?”  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/agv4ngxvjzcb1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f4106905719facc3e078dbf048f78a490755b13

The AI-created strategy was interesting but I then made some tweaks based on the basket of AI stocks I wanted to include in this momentum trading approach. I removed IBM (as I don’t think they’ll be a key beneficiary or leader in the AI race), and added PLTR (for defence/government AI exposure), TSM (for some semiconductor exposure) and META (this is a questionable one but the open source models that their research team have created our world-class and I don’t want to bet against Zuck).

**Plot Twist:** 

Thinking about allocating another $1k into a different AI strategy to hedge risk whistle staying within blast radius of broader industry upside.

Trading strategy,StockMarket,"Is ONLY Trading When The Stock Market is UP, Possibly The BEST Strategy For Day Trading? :)","Just out of curiosity, is there anyone here that ONLY day trades on days when the Stock Market (and by that I pretty much mean the S&P 500, since it represents most of the stock market) is doing WELL?

As Mark Cuban says: ""Everyone is a Genius with Day Trading, when the stock market is doing WELL""

Others also say that just about ANY day strategy works really well when the stock market is doing well for the day.

I have to say, my trades ALWAYS seem to work out better on days when the stock market is up...

So again, does anyone here ONLY day trade when the stock market is actually up? I know that obviously limits how often you can trade... but if you have a MUCH higher win rate, and can potentially go for bigger gains, does that make it a GOOD strategy?  :)

I know it sounds like common sense... but I doubt many people use this as their actual main strategy (but SOME must, right???)",8,You should write for market watch,"Conceptually correct.

Trading strategy,StockMarket,Broken Wing Butterfly Options Trading Strategy,"What it is:

There are several ways you can view a broken wing butterfly. 

You can view it as an unbalanced butterfly where the strikes of the long butterfly aren’t equidistant from the short strike making one wider than the other. 

Another way to view this strategy is the combination of a credit spread and a debit spread with the same short strike. The credit spread will be wider than the debit spread, typically allowing you to collect a net credit. 

Another way to view this strategy is a ratio spread with a further OTM long contract to define your risk. 

&#x200B;

How to set it up:

Broken wing butterflies can be set up with either calls or puts, but for simplicity's sake, we will cover an example of setting up a put broken wing butterfly. 

The first step is to go to the OTM put strikes and sell two of the same strike contracts. A common way to determine which strike is by using delta. Most options traders like to trade broken wing butterflies with the short strike somewhere between 20 to 50 delta. 

Once you sell the short strikes, you must buy two puts. One will be below the short strike and the other above. 

For example, if your short strike is 100, you can buy a 105 put and a 90 put. In this case, you will have a 105/100 put debit spread and a 100/90 put credit spread.

&#x200B;

Pros/Cons:

Every options strategy comes with its own pros and cons. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the broken wing butterfly can help you make more informed decisions. 

#### Pros

* Hedged against volatility more than a credit spread
* Ability to take half the trade off at a time
* Potential to make money on both the credit spread and debit spread

#### Cons

* High commissions since it is a 4-leg strategy
* Lower credit collected than a credit spread

Trading strategy,StockMarket,Straddle vs. Strangle Options Trading Strategies,"What is it?  


A straddle and a strangle are similar in that they are both options trading strategies that involve holding a long position (a ""call option"") and a short position (a ""put option"") on the same underlying asset. The important difference between the two is the strike prices of the options. 

&#x200B;

Straddle:

In a straddle, the strike prices of the call and put options are the same. This means that if the underlying stock price moves significantly in either direction, the investor can make a profit by exercising one of the options (either the call or the put) and offsetting the loss on the other option. 

Strangle:

In a strangle, the strike prices of the call and put options are different. The call option has a higher strike price, and the put option has a lower strike price. This means that the strangle allows for a greater range of underlying stock prices at expiration in which the options will be in the money, and the investor can make a profit. 

&#x200B;

Straddle vs. Strangle:

Both straddle and strangle strategies are considered to be high-risk, high-reward strategies, and they are not suitable for all investors. It's important to have a solid understanding of options trading and the underlying asset before engaging in these strategies and also to be aware of the risks and costs involved. Straddle is considered to be riskier than strangle because, with a straddle, the investor has to pay a higher premium than with strangle.

Trading strategy,StockMarket,Trading strategy for beginners using the PCR OI Indicator," 

Based on my study I offer the following trading strategy for beginners using the PCR OI Indicator:

* Intraday option traders should begin trading after two hours of the market opening.
* Stop loss maximums are set at 30 points (naked) and 20-25 points(spreads) per lot.
* Based on PCR (Put Call Ratio) statistics, the entry should be closed to vwap.
* Buy a call if the PCR is larger than 1.25, and a put if the PCR is less than 0.75 to close the VWAP.
* It is also critical to notice the PCR's growing and decreasing pattern.
* Option on ATM/ITM trading (Delta: 0.4 to 0.6).
* The trailing stop loss is critical.
* Profit booking rules: 30 to 40 points for each lot.
* Trade when you receive a free 25-point Trail SL
* Trade naked options on an intraday basis only.

Options trading,StockMarket,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y)

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP)

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

[https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU](https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU)

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

Hope this was helpful, let me know what ya think!!",401,"I appreciate the enthusiasm and time taken for this thoughtful post.  IMO It's a good intro but it doesn't prepare anyone to trade options, especially to be a premium seller.

There's more to options than you've described here.  One glaring omission is implied volatility.  It's what usually leads new option traders to ask ""***Why did my call go down in value even though the stock went up in price?***"".  You mention Theta.  Aside from time, IV is a major contributor to that.","Great post mate!

People who think this is easy cash get slaughtered. 

When I was asked by my colleagues why I dont trade options I always outline that of course you can lose every thing with stocks, but let's face it - having stocks like Microsoft or JnJ in your portfolio means your most likely not gonna lose 99% in a week.","Great started guide, if I had awards to give you’d get one.

Why am I getting approved for margin, but not getting the clearance I need to simply buy and sell assets? It hardly makes sense; what am I missing here?

I have a stable trading strategy and have been using it to buy and sell ETFs for about a year now. I want to access options trading to reduce risk, more than to increase revenue.

I applied for level I the first time and got approved for writing covered calls, which I have no use for, and margin, which I don't really intend to use either. When I reapplied for level II, I got rejected due to low income.

I'm severely disabled in a developing country, so I make peanuts on a good month and I'm virtually unemployable in any formal way. Hence, I make less than $24K, which is the lowest échelon on the form. Was I too honest on the application? I guess it's too late for that now.

Is there a way to appeal or negotiate the approval? What am I doing wrong here? Should I give them a call?

Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,Fundamental Analysis; Alphabet Inc $GOOGL,"Hello /r/stockmarket!

Even in these tough times, I keep chopping away at the research and analysis that I always do. Today's write-up is about Alphabet Inc, more commonly known as the parent company of Google (Ticker: $GOOGL). As always, this is my own fundamental analysis, and the write-up that follows. I employ trend research and discounted cash flow analysis, and it is fully up to you if you want to take anything here written as fact. Numbers and information is taken from the 4th quarter of 2017 and earlier. That said, here is my view of Alphabet Inc.
__________
**The company**  
Alphabet is an holding and parent company of many subsidiaries, focusing on technology. What kind of technology you ask? Well, a ton of it. Here is a list of some of the subsidiaries that Alphabet has under its massive technological wing:

* Google, an internet company focusing on it’s famous search engine, advertising business and video service through Youtube. It goes without saying that Google is by far the largest and most profitable of Alphabets businesses.
* Calico, a R&D biotech company
* Chronicle, a cybersecurity and anti-hacking company
* Dandelion, a geothermal energy startup company.
* DeepMind, an Artificial intelligence company
* GV (Google venture), a strategic investment company
* CapitalG (Google Capital), a profit-directed investment company
* Google fiber, a developer for fiber networking and an ISP 
* Nest Labs, a home automation company. Develops programmable home appliances. 
* Jigsaw (Google Ideas), a tech incubator company, focusing on unique technology
* Sidewalk labs, urban innovation company, developer within infrastructure and urban technology.
*  Verily (Google X), life-science research and development company
* Waymo, world leading company in autonomous driving

As you can see, the list of technological focuses is incredibly broad. Alphabet is an ad company that puts all its profits into developing thousands of products to revolutionize the future.

  __________

**Fundamentals & Forecasts**   
Alphabet has a annual revenue of $110,8 billion, resulting in a gross profit of $66,5 billion and a net profit (earnings) of $13,9 billion. That is an 24% increase in revenue year to year (y/y). Alphabets numbers are slightly jumbled up recently as this quarter, like many other tech giants in the US following the tax reform of the new year, moved huge amount of international profits into the US. This resulted in alphabets tax rate for Q4 2017 to become 138% of their pre-tax income. We have to adjust for this one time payment, as Alphabet moves that money into the country to invest in their capital expenditure and R&D. The company has a historical tax rate of roughly 18-19%, which is very low. Also of note, Alphabet has during the last 2 years fairly consistently increased their R&D spending by 20% y/y each quarter, really highlighting how the company is putting more and more money into their technology R&D. Their general operating margin is roughly 60%, which is also very high, but not uncommon in the ad market. A last notion to mention is that Alphabet is after their intake of additional saved up international cash very net cash positive, with a war chest of $97 billion. As a huge part of Alphabet is founding its own startups, acquiring other startups that have potential and investing in either one, their huge war chest is a very strong advantage for them to have. 

Alphabet is huge. It’s enormous. This makes forecasting complicated as they can have huge swings if their profitability goes down, and it could be very hard to recover. I preface the next message with this, so you as a reader is aware. Alphabet right now has amazing fundamentals. The company is incredibly strong. They have the historical income numbers of a growth company, while being profitable and stable. These are facts that make Alphabet very fundamentally sound.

 If we assume that Alphabet reached their growth peak in 2017, and from there have a steady growth slowdown until they run into a complete growth-stop in 2030, as well as maintained tax rate (20%), gross (& operating) margin (60% respective 23%), we still see upside in its current price. These calculations were done at a -3% maturity rate, along with a discount rate of 7%. These are fairly standard industry numbers. Using this pessimistic view of the company in my eyes, seeing no further improvement, the net present stock value would end up at $1199, a valuation upside of 15% after the recent drop. The more realistic scenario is the same, except that we maintain the current growth for the coming year, and then seeing a slower maturity drop until the growth-stop, we see an 34% upside, $1402. 

  __________


**Concerns & Risk**  
The recent discussions about Alphabet is its issues with TAC, traffic acquisition cost. That is the cost that Alphabet pays to get traffic to their services, where the expense is increasing and margins decreasing fairly rapidly. At the beginning of 2016, the ad revenue of $18 million was hurt by a TAC of $3.7 million, which is an TAC cost of sale of 21% of the ad revenue. These numbers increased to $21.4 million, $4.63 million and 21.6% respectively. Now, at the end of 2017, the TAC expense grows 11.5% faster than the ad revenue. This is clearly a problem for Google as a service, and as their margins fall, this causes real concern about their profitability. If we apply a lowering margin down from a VERY consistent 60% gross margin after cost of sales, down 1% per year down to 53%, we see the net present evaluation drop to 946 per share, a -10% downside. This is a real risk, and is the scenario where Google slowly loses its iron grasp on the ad industry. The very realistic scenario, the middle ground, is where Alphabets margins drop from their consistent 60%, to 56% by 2020. 56% gross margin was what happened this last quarter, Q417, which caused the 10% drop in value along with uncertainties in the overall market. If Alphabet never recovers from this drop in margin, their current valuation is fair. If they recover but slowly struggle down to 56% again, even slowly down to 53%,  they have a very slight downside. As you can see, this is a potential problem for Google. It is worth pointing out that this drop is very abrupt, a blip, and is no proof of any sort of a trend. A similar company, Facebook $FB, has a gross margin of 87%, which shows that higher margins is also attainable.

  __________


**My view**  
Alphabet has been my personal favorite company since I became an adult, which makes me slightly biased. I am happy to report that my financial knowledge tells me that they also deserve the praise I give them personally. The company is amazing, attaining growth numbers that shouldn’t happen to large businesses like this. Most analysts are right to worry about the recent decline in gross margins, but if these are improved, they should be a catalyst that removes the sliver of doubt that is the only thing holding Alphabets price down. I will most certainly hold Alphabet through that. It is such a diverse business, deep into the future of tech, supported by the greatest ad company this world have ever seen. They are regulated hard to leave their main product, Google search engine, unbiased as if they were greedy with it, could dominate any market. That power is impossible to put a $ on.

I personally believe that Google is a perfect buying opportunity for a very long term investment. They will get their margins back on track, their excellent management fully understand this. It might not be the next quarter, it might not be the quarter after that. However, if we assume that their operating margins look very realistic, bordering pessimistic, and that they recover their margin issue over the next 4 years, their net present stock value is $1236, a 18% upside. This doesn’t make Alphabet a snap purchase, but it makes them a fair purchase. When you buy Alphabet you buy a sliver of the future. They have their hand in every single futuristic technology, everything from Biotech to AI and self-driving cars, to VR/AR to the internet of things. They are industry leaders in all of these (barring biotech, tough industry). When these markets become profitable in the future, your good purchase of Alphabet today becomes an excellent hedge into the R&D of the future.

I bought Alphabet right before the drop of 10%. My only mistake is that I did not buy more. However, it turned out fine since it tanked. I am happy people doubt their margins because WHEN they recover, I will own a lot more Alphabet than I would have without the drop.

Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,Fundamental Analysis Article: Paypal Corp $PYPL,"**Paypal**

Hello /r/stockmarket!

This is the next write-up in my addition to this subreddit. This is my own analysis, done through fundamentals and discounted cash flow to determine the net present value of companies, as well as the overall trend of their respective industry. I’ve already done Square inc. ($SQ) and Lending Tree ($TREE), and now continue with my favorite sector, financial technology (fintech). As always, if you would like a copy of my financial model, please message me! I’ll answer any questions right here.

**Paypal** is a company that works with payments solutions and the transfer of currency (non-crypto), for both businesses and private individuals. Paypal make their revenue from both a steady and % fee on each transaction that they process. The current value of Paypal is 91 billion USD, a quite steep price for a company such as this (a trailing P/E of 51). Paypal has also both started and acquired a basket of payment services, each focusing on different type of transactions. 

**To name a few:**

Braintree payments, a one stop shop online merchant system.
Venmo, a peer-2-peer mobile payment system
Paydiant, a seamless mobile payment system for businesses. Walmart uses paydiant in their digital systems.
Xoom, a remittance company, focusing on far-distance transfers over long distances for emerging markets
Modest, a simple payment system for online merchant with focus on ease of implementation

As you can see, they have a clear focus but claim a strong brand within their sector, fintech payments.

** Fundamentals**    
Paypal generated 3,7 billion dollars of revenue last quarter, with an average revenue growth of roughly 20% y/y in the last 4 quarters. They have an operating margin around 15-16%, and a net margin of 12-13%. These low margins are very common for payment solution companies, as they handle a huge amount of capital. Speaking of capital, the total payment volume (TPV) is the driving earnings generator for the company is at 131 billion USD, and is increasing 20-30% y/y in the last 5 quarters. Keep in mind that the TPV growth is increasing quarter to quarter. TPV growth is really what drives the business, and the TPV growth and revenue growth has a roughly 76% correlation, where TPV increases a bit faster than the revenue itself. Paypal as of today pays roughly 18% effective tax, making them incredibly efficient turning volume into net profit. It is also worth pointing out that Paypal is debtless, and is 5.4 billion net positive cash in their warchest.

**Ebay & War on cash**  
Paypal is currently down for this year, after they were announced to be dropped from Ebay as the primary payment service, since Ebay want to collect payment fees themselves. This caused a rough 10% drop in the price of Paypal. It is currently very uncertain how much this hurts Paypal, as Ebay payment volume is today 13% of Paypal's TPV. On top of this, something known as the war on cash is going on all over the world right now. If you are not aware of this, for sure do your research if you are interested in payment technology. Right now a majority of the worlds transactions happen through cash, but the % of cash transactions compared to the % digital payment transactions is currently is shrinking, fast. This translates to every single payment company’s market is growing, daily.  

**Estimates & Result**  
So following the guidance put down by Paypal in their last ER gives 2018 an TPV growth of 20%, as well as a revenue of 15.000-15.250 billion USD, as well as their past performance, while maintaining margins, we are expected to see an increase in profits with an EPS going from 1.33 in 2017 to 1.6 in 2018. In my usual processes, I try to be conservative. I attempt to capture a conservative scenario that is very likely, and do not expect anything amazing to happen (optimism is not better than realism in the market). I usually see what a company is valued at assuming the company peaked in the last quarter reported. Assuming that their own guidance is correct for 2018, and that slowly their growth will go down after peaking in 2018, their net present value ends up at 82 billion USD, which is 12% less than their current market cap at 91.2 billion USD. This would put Paypal into overpriced ranged. However, there are some interesting things around here. As Paypal's market (the payment market) grows rapidly, there is tons of potential that is hard to calculate fundamentally. If the entire market grows to its full size, which would be roughly by 2/3rds, and Paypal takes a portion of that market share, their growth rate would increase rapidly. A sign of this is their increasing growth in TPV. The model which assumes peak in 2018 leaves their net present stock value at 69.4 USD, a 9% downside to its current valuation. The more optimistic model, which I also find more realistic, is where Paypal have at least 2 more years of growth until they peak. In this scenario they maintain their revenue growth of 17, until 2021, while maintaining margins. After that peak, slowly decline by 2% per year, with a discount rate of 7% (fair I’d say), their net present stock value is at 96 USD, 27% upside.


**Conclusion**  
Paypal is a very tough company to evaluate, one of the hardest I’ve ever analyzed. They are a growth company for sure, but a very expensive one. They are priced at a point where they keep growing without many issues. If you assume peak in 2018, they are overvalued, 20% so pre “correction”, and 9% now. However, assuming payment solution growth companies peaking this year is practically assuming the company's failure. There is not success without additional growth. There is for sure risk there, especially with events like Ebay dropping them (note, it was not unexpected, but bad nonetheless). It’s hard to estimate how much it damages them, if at all, and if similar things will happen when competition with lower prices arise. However, all this said there is so much to like. A debtless company that is top of their respective field R&D-wise, making great profits (even if you are paying quite a bit for that profit at trailing PE of 51). As the digital payment volume increases, paypal will gain a portion of that, which makes Paypal a stable purchase if you want to bet against cash (which is smart). The questions to look out after are for sure:

How does paypal maintain their Revenue to TPV ratio? This number is crucial as they most likely will increase their TPV. One problem might be that they have to lower their fees to compete in the future.
How does the competition look? The world if filled with competition, and its truly fierce here. Any provider that is cheaper/as cheap and/or easier/as easy, will out-compete Paypal rapidly.
Where is the expected revenue peak? If you assume it 2018 it looks pretty bad, if you assume it later it start looking good fast.

If we see an increase in guidance as well as results in 2018-2019, it will be good enough news to maintain the goal of not peaking before 2020, which would make paypal a 26% upside purchase today.

**My take:**  
I believe in Paypal, however I much more strongly believe in the profitability of the war on cash. I think that if you are not invested in the “war” you are making a huge mistake.

Good places to be include:  **$V (Visa inc), $PYPL (Paypal) and $MA (Mastercard)$.**

I currently own Paypal, it is currently just below 10% of my portfolio. I am down 10% after their earnings and Ebay announcement. The earnings looked better than I expected, and I am very pleased. I plan to average down to roughly 15% of my portfolio, and hold very long term until I can reap the benefits of the transition to a cashless world. I would buy Visa over Paypal, as it comes with less risk. I will make a write-up on them next. I own both, the same amount. 

Thanks for reading!

",111,Hey this fantastic. Where/how did you learn how to analyze this stuff? Im not sure where to start,PYPL is the only stock I'm long on. Thanks for the write up.,"Great write up. I'm so optimistic about PYPL and bearish about eBays future. As someone who has made a small fortune by reselling things online for over 20 years, I can tell you eBay is quickly falling out of favor. There are so many smaller second hand markets that have emerged. Niche sites like grailed, discogs, and reverb are quickly gaining ground. The one thing they have in common? PayPal. There are even hundreds of niche forums that have their own marketplaces. Even reddit has places like hardware swap. People are even selling on FB now. The one payment method they use? PayPal. It's come to a point where PayPal is now a verb. And it makes sense to not sell on eBay because they charge a ridiculous 10% for anything sold.

And that's not even considering the future of Venmo, which is a monster by itself. And zero debt? PayPal is very well run company with a lot of growth ahead of it."
Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,Fundamental analysis tool for entire exchanges,"Hi All, 
Over the past few years I've been trying to expand my ability to do fundamental analysis. Read a number of books and have come to a comfortable place with it. Though still felt frustrated in my attempts to analyse data freely. Copying page after page of financial data into spreadsheets just didn't cut it. I felt surely if the maths was right, then I should just run it on every company and pick the best regardless of how popular it is. 

So I recently started creating this tool for myself: https://imgur.com/a/8ZKW0cc

It does the following:

* 1)Gather financial statement data off multiple exchanges (currently S&P500, Dow, Nasdaq, FTSE250).

* 2)Calculate statistical measures for all listed companies (e.g. piotroski F scores)

* 3)Summarise all this in a single excel spreadsheet.

The basic system is there now and running on my PC, but I could make it better. In future I hope to include discounted cashflows and earnings consistency. I'd like to get your opinions. If you had a tool that could do this, what sort of fundamental statistics would you be interested in seeing?",3,"If you are having it pull things like F scores, why not include some of the more basic measures. I'm thinking
- P/E Ratio and Forward P/E Ratio
- Sales Growth (YoY)
- Earnings Growth (YoY)
etc...

Just a thought.",I don't understand 1 bit what you linked. Step 1 making it user friendly and visualized.,You can't use fundamentals in this market.
Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,Fundamental Analysis on Why GME is Still a Buy,"Hi There!

I posted this on another sub but folks told me to post on others so more people understand the fundamental case for GME.  Long time lurker, first time poster on a new account. Thanks to WSB and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), I was able to go from $25k in April to just passing the $1MM mark ousing leads I found reddit along with my own DD.  Big plays were PTON >> NIO >> NVAX >> now GME. Proof (Up $900k of gains since Jan 1 2021, no idea how to go further back on TastyWorks, mods lmk if you need more proof):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4kuqjqdjrnf61.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f69616b38be75a647af85ba362ad4c8cbab7e12

I haven’t been seeing a lot of DD on GME fundamentals, so I figure it was my time to give back with some research on why I still think GME is a still value play not just momentum. Here's why I believe GME's current valuation is no more out of whack than the rest of the market, and why it still has so much more room to run.

# GME’s E-commerce

What if we stripped out all of GME’s brick and mortar business and just looked at it as an e-commerce business? Here are the stats vs. some comps:

**GME:** $1.35B, 300% growth Q4 YoY

**Chewy:** $6.5B (12mo ending 10/20), 45% growth Q3 YoY, Enterprise Value: $41.83, Enterprise Value to Revenue: 6.48

**StitchFix:** $1.8B (12mo ending 10/20), 10% growth Q3 YoY, Enterprise Value: $9.8, Enterprise Value to Revenue: 5.57

Crazy when you look at it this way. How much would an e-commerce company with $1.35B in revenue growing at 300% a year be worth with today’s valuations? If you used Chewy’s EV to Revenue of 6.5 for GME, you get a valuation of \~$9B or a stock price of about $125. But wait a second, GME’s e-commerce grew almost 10x faster than Chewy’s and 30x faster than StitchFix this last quarter.

For a high watermark of a EV/Rev in e-commerce, we can see Poshmark with an EV/Rev of 24. They have a secondhand social marketplace for apparel, which is not a leap from GameStop’s game trade in model. Using that, GME should have an EV of $33B or a share price of \~$475. And that is using a pre-Ryan Cohen e-comm revenue. Imagine how much it’ll rocket now that he’s on the board. Hedge funds will probably argue that GME got a one time boost from the launch of new consoles, but you can say the same thing about folks avoiding dressing rooms in retailers across the country.

**Tl;dr: GME is worth somewhere between $125-$475 per share with their e-commerce biz alone at today’s valuations, and that was pre-Ryan Cohen**

# GME’s Brick and Mortar

In that first part, I highlighted why GME is worth it on e-commerce alone, brick and mortar is where I am really excited. Hedge funds will tell you it has been a drain on earnings, and that all transactions are becoming digital. To date that has been true, with GME reporting terrible numbers since the start of the pandemic. But what if GME took the consumer obsessed mindset that had in Chewy, applied it to a bigger Total Addressable Market (TAM) in gaming, and they had physical storefronts as assets? The possibilities are endless if GME pushes the limits of innovation.

A couple of examples:

1. Back when Best Buy began their turn around, they started monetizing their store footprint for their store-in-a-stores. Most of the electronics manufacturers like Samsung needed a showroom but didn’t want to build the infrastructure to compete with the Apple stores. They realized having a neutral showroom was critical to competing and were willing to pay rent. The revenue sharing agreement with Microsoft looks like a step in this direction, as Microsoft closed their storefronts earlier this year.

[Best Buy bets big on store-within-store concepts - StarTribune.com](https://www.startribune.com/best-buy-bets-big-on-store-within-store-concepts/215301161/)

[GameStop will reportedly get a cut of Xbox games, even if you’re not buying them from GameStop - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517970/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games#:~:text=The%20new%20revenue%20sharing%20deal,Gold%20and%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass).)

2) Imagine if GME competed with the likes of Twitch, but their asset was physical locations. Think mini e-sports arenas. Where retail was a side benefit instead of the end-all-be all. Many tabletop gaming stores having this as a model. It could be a reimagination of 80s arcades

[GameStop Stepping Up to the Plate in Esports | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/14/gamestop-stepping-up-to-the-plate-in-esports.aspx)

3) Build a PC Kiosks that are coming. I believe no matter how much things go digital, there is going to be a need for hardware and peripherals at least for the forseeable future.

[$GME DD- Build-a-PC Kiosks Coming : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

This could be a situation where 1+1 = 3. Where a robust, growing e-commerce platform could complement an amazing in-person experience – and one that others can’t replicate. So while the current valuation is supported by the e-commerce business alone, the in-store opportunities could make this an amazing buy. Plus, they are closing unproductive stores, their debt levels aren’t crazy, and are close to being free cash flow positive despite the lock down. I'd argue the GameStop brand recognition alone is worth $1B of goodwill

**Tl;dr GME B&M is a drag on the books, but there is huge opportunity.**

# How did hedge funds miss this?

In order for hedge funds to get their massive returns, they gross up meaning they take an equal amount of long and short bets to stay neutral to the market while taking crazy amounts of leverage. Their macro bet was simple, long e-commerce short brick and mortar. And that was right to an extent. GME was a perfect target bc of software transactions going digital. But I think they missed one big thing: the risk is asymmetric now bc of the Fed’s printers going brrrrrrrrrrrrrr. They bet on a bunch of companies going bankrupt but many aren’t because of the easy access to cheap liquidity. So the short side can’t go down anymore, which means their risk is way out of whack and they overly suppressed valuations on the short side.

I think also GME is also a special case, where Wall Street used traditional B&M retailer valuations when there is so much more opportunity here. $1B of e-commerce growing at 300% is **OUT OF THIS WORLD**. For the next 10 years, I don't see game hardware and peripherals going away which is still a huge TAM. I don't think any other meme stock has this story. Ryan Cohen saw it, we see, but the talking heads on CNBC don’t seem to as of yet. This valuation is still great, and no where near what we are seeing with all the IPOs out there. Like how does Palantir have a $60B valuation with $700M of revenue growing at 50%? GME's e-comm business beats in revenue and growth. It really just goes against the Hedge Fund/media narrative of value and their traditional DCFs. I could see this rubber banding back up on pure value once they are back to a positive EPS, and beyond once the e-commerce really takes off. I may need to hold for a year, but I see strong growth ahead regardless

**Position:** 1000 shares of long stock, OTM naked short puts for premium and potential average down

**Tl;dr: If Wallstreet is okay with Tech Valuations GME is still a buy not for the squeeze, but as a mid to long term growth play (as in may need to hold for a year).  Great entry point right now** 

Obligatory, this is not financial advice, I just like the stock",43,"im holding, 5 @ 60 not because of a ""squeeze"" but because of this. If they were to take half there stores close them and the other half as pick up locations for ecommerce, do warehousing and add pc components etc. could even add a steam like store i see no reason for gamestop to actually close. that would be like a blockbuster to ignorant to conform..","Typically after a scenario like this, you will have so many bag holders that it essentially sets a roof on the stock price.  Any time it starts going up those bag holders sell in relief causing stock to placate. 

Hard to say what the fair value should be, I'm sure it will go down too much as well temporarily (if it hasn't already) and then have a decent rebound.","I originally took a position on GME because of the potential short squeeze, and while my average cost is not too high it’s definitely above the current market price. This was reassuring to read and allows me to come to terms with my situation. Knowing there’s a possibility for GME to have a bright future is enough reassurance to continue holding shares for me. Everyone stuck with shares right now might not be in vain."

1) what are the most important criteria/ratio/fundamentals when selecting an airline company to put my money on?

2) which airlines have the most chance of staying afloat after this beer virus situation ends? and why?

But given the last 12 months is not a strong indicator of the next 12, I'd look at Debt to Equity. LUV has a low debt to equity compared to the others, but also has a higher PE. Forward PE is pure speculation at this point.

Also look at cash flow and specifically their current cash on hand.  If they have low debt and lots of cash, they'll survive the longest. 

Price to book is also another good one in case they actually do go under or can start selling assets to stay afloat.

Good luck!","You want to look for a strong balance sheet right now because cash flow has become nearly non-existent, so some important ratios to look at will be the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the debt/assets ratio. You'll also want to make sure the company has been increasing its revenue while holding steady margins before COVID-19. Another thing to consider is the fact that this could cause a recession, so discount airlines may be particularly resilient during a post-virus recession."

Technical analysis,StockMarket,$NVDA 1D Technical Analysis,"View my 1D chart analysis for Nvidia below, what do you guys think? With the AI boom showing no signs of slowing down (at least not that I'm aware of), I like the company on a fundamental level and have a few shares at around $300, so I'm just looking to add to my position at this point. The circled levels represent the next entry points I'll be looking to get in at.

For reference, my next potential entries will depend on developments in the bigger-picture macro sentiment toward artificial intelligence & microchip industries, but for now, are as follows: entry #1 is around $445, entry #2 is around $410, and entry #3 around $375. Was thinking I would add 1 or 2 shares at entry 1, and then larger numbers of shares if price action takes us down to the other 2 circled areas. Wondering whether any of you guys think the price will reach as low as $370 in the coming months because it seems like the stock just keeps on running higher recently with so much positive media coverage

That gap might get filled in the relatively near term.

As a high probability bull play, anyone should have bought a significant long position as soon as the price gapped up to exceed its most recent previous (Nov/Dec 2021) high point.

After any blue sky breakout on strong volume, the long position benefits from the fundamental reality of, who's going to sell the stock now? ... :) Answer: Not so many, until market conditions or company circumstances change.","It is overpriced and a speculation bubble.

Technical analysis,StockMarket,Two Questions About Technical Analysis,"I know people liken technical analysis to astrology, but, in my humble opinion, technical analysis can give an idea of how “Mr. Market” feels about a company. Basically, when a company is oversold, it means Mr. Market hates it, and when it’s overbought, then Mr. Market is in love with it. Having said that, I’m not a technical investor. I would base 90% of the investing decision on fundamental analysis and only 10% on technical analysis. That’s how I personally see it. But I’m not really an expert, so take what I say with a ton of salt.

If you happen to use technical analysis in your decision-making process, which chart do you use? Do you use the yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily? And why do you prefer that time frame?

Finally, which indicators do you think show the overbought and oversold states?",1,"TA works great to predict a likely move, for some patterns, like a falling wedge for example.
  The challenge is picking the price target to complete the trade.  If you get greedy then you could just watch it reverse on you.  If you aren’t greedy enough then it’s not even worth the risk.  

I look at many different time frames as some patterns will take much longer to play out 

But I have a day job and I don’t daytrade, I just use it to help decide a good time to buy into a stock I like or sell off a profitable position that I don’t believe in medium to long term","I trade primarily through technical analysis.  I use the 10 minute & daily charts for day trading, the daily & weekly charts for swing trading, and the weekly & monthly chart for investments.

In other words, a chart's time frame factors into how long you should expect the probabilities to play out in the way the chart indicates. Technical analysis is just a way to interpret probabilities. A trader who goes long on a stock as it forms a bull flag on its daily chart should not expect the bull flag to play out intraday, but instead over the course of days or weeks.  So the time frame you choose should be matched to how long you want to be in a trade.","I use technical analysis as part of picking a price for buys and sells within a narrow price range based on things like the historical P/E.  It hasn’t worked especially well for protecting me from losses, but I have more confidence buying below the 50 day moving average than above it.  Technical analysis is my lucky charm for confidence."
Technical analysis,StockMarket,SP500 Technical Analysis & Trading Plan,"*I share my plan for discussion or education and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas. This plan uses futures prices.*

***Recap***: In the planning for today I was watching **4380** as a pivot zone, with shorts below it and longs above. To the short side, the market never actually closed a candle below 4380, but in the interest of transparency: I erroneously entered anyways and was fortunate enough to quickly exit the trade. To the long side, I wrote that *“If I were to trade it, I’d look for some consolidation beneath or at \[****4380****\] that lasts a while, 45+ minutes, and breakthrough.”* This happened about 30 minutes after the open today but since I made a mistake earlier, I followed my rules and did not trade again. This was clearly the signal the market gave to me, but I’ll chalk it up to being a Monday and move on. 

***Balance/Trend***: The market remains in a broad balance area from **4357-4419** and the next trend leg up or down will look to materialize outside of that range. The market is trading about 70 points above the 12-month yellow trend line that the market recovered last week and needs to hold **4342** tomorrow to keep it intact. Since late July, the market is in a down trend marked in black with resistance at **4479**. 

***Analysis***: The overnight and cash session made for a fairly standard balance/consolidation day, finding support near **4353-57** and resistance at **4413-15**. The market was able to breakout from the bull flag and validate it, though the market remains in a broad balance area which makes it difficult to draw any conclusions beyond that. The gap beginning at **4419** is severely weakened by this point and a breach of it could trigger a strong rally that fills the gap and moves higher to **4466** and **4479**. Breaking back down below **4360-57** (4353 lowest) is a rejection of the value established over the last week and could get the market back to the yellow trend line. Any breakdown below **4336** is an early warning sign that bulls have lost control of the market. 

* Potential support: **4377, 4363, 4353-57, 4342, 4336, 4323, 4317, 4309**
* Potential resistance: **4413-15, 4419, 4446, 4466, 4479, 4500-04, 4515**

Technical analysis,StockMarket,"From my noob perspective, technical analysis is nonsense.","Granted, I could be very wrong, as I'm very new to the game.

But from watching a ton of videos showing how various indicators predict price direction, 100% of them do the following:

""Hey, let's look at this EMA line.  You see how the price broke through it and continues to ride above it?  That means it's trending up and it's probably a good time to buy.  Now see how it quickly dipped below the EMA line and is now consistently below it?  That means the EMA line became the new resistance.""

Uhhhh ok... so we're just gonna gloss over the ""dipped below the EMA"" part?  If the price can just randomly dip below that EMA at any point, then what the hell is the point of all this?  It's like saying ""to run without falling, just keep running, and when you fall that means you fell.""  ...Great.

Technical analysis,StockMarket,SP500 Technical Analysis & Trading Plan for 10/10/23," *I share my plan for discussion or education and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas.*

***Recap***: In the plan for today I said that the trendline that bulls needed to recover was at **4316** and that I would want to see *“if the market can test 4309s and then recover* ***4317*** *to go long”*. This played out to perfection and the market set the day’s lows right at that level and then moved \~54 points higher. The first way to trade this was in the premarket when it reclaimed about 30 minutes before the open. However, I didn’t get the setup I wanted here and didn’t take this trade.

I instead opted to enter long at the **4336** level, and wrote that “*I would expect sellers to push back a bit and test buyers’ strength”* there and that I would want to wait for that pullback and then enter over 4336. This ended up pulling back to the trendline at **4316**, set the lows, and I entered per my rules. I took less risk than I normally do given that the market had already moved up quite a bit, but the trade worked out fine and moved right to **4359** and the next level at **4374**. I normally remove all risk at a target in the 10-15 point range, and took my profits there.

***Balance/Trend***: After breaking higher from the 12-month trendline Friday and briefly dipping below it again on news of the war breaking out over the weekend, the market recovered the trendline today and closed well above it. Bulls did what they needed to and now this trend support moves to **4324**. In the nearer term, the market is still flagging from the July highs and is in the pullback channel marked in black for the time being. Finally, the market has broken out from the recent balance zone by clearing the highs at **4357-59**.

***Analysis***: The market has rallied for two consecutive sessions after finding support at the black channel lows and recovering the year-long trend line up. In doing so, the market also backtested the breakout level from May at **4336** and the 200 day moving average and has made an early recovery. After such a strong move, there may be a cooling off period or some consolidation before the next trend move materializes. I will be watching for a failure at **4336** as an early warning sign that the market is breaking down again, but bulls mainly need to keep the market above **4324** to keep control of the market. A failure to hold the trend line (**4309** absolute lowest) would put bears back in charge and likely trigger deeper selling to **4250**. 

* Potential supports: **4363, 4359, 4347, 4324, 4317, 4309, 4300, 4289, 4254**
* Potential resistances: **4383, 4396-4400, 4418-19, 4425, 4464, 4502**

Technical analysis,StockMarket,SP500 Technical Analysis & Trading Plan,"*I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas. This plan uses the futures market for levels.* 

***Recap***: I noted in the plan for today that the market was finding some near term balance, and trying to trade too many levels or setups in this environment usually leads to losses. There were several pieces of the plan that would have worked for today though, and the goal is always to catch one of them. 

In the plan for today, there were several setups that I mapped out that I could have (or maybe should have) traded. One such setup was at the key support zone at **4494-98** and I said that I would look to play it either as support at **4487** or that another option would be to *“let the market test below the Friday lows and try to reclaim that range in order to get into a long.”* I took this trade at about 12:30 EST, just before the market settled into an hour-long \~8-point range that really tested my patience. Volume entered the market and I exited the majority of the trade at the next level **4506** and left a runner to exit at the pink trendline at **4522**. 

***Balance/Trend***: The market traded lower overnight and then sharply rejected yesterday’s range at the open today. The primary structure right now is the downtrend outlined in black. The market is still holding both of the aqua blue trend lines which define the trend from March, so this is still the bigger trend to watch. 

***Analysis***: The market is working inside of the down-sloping black channel in the charts and found support there today for the third time, coinciding with another backtest to the ascending triangle structure (in pink) at **4494**. The market broke out from this structure on July 12 (this was also the basis for the **4487** support level) and it’s important that bulls hold these levels if this breakout is to remain intact. With no economic releases tomorrow ahead of inflation data on the backend of the week, it would not surprise me to see periods of chop tomorrow. 

It is now essential that bulls hold **4506** for a sustained move higher and in an effort to reclaim the pink trendline at **4527**. With this level breaking down twice now though and today’s close beneath it, it’s on the verge of irrelevance. Moving back inside of this trend though could accelerate the bull case and push the market back to testing the expanding range lows (**4547-50**) and then the very important balance area which has already been retested once at **4559**. 

***Plan***: 

* Potential support levels: **4506, 4494-98, 4489, 4483, 4479, 4466, 4447**, **4438**
* Potential resistance levels: **4527**, **4536-38, 4547-50, 4559, 4589-93, 4597, 4609**

Once FED started raising rates, they could not off load those fast enough because they did not want to book even an ounce of loss since that will affect their bonus. And now most of them may not be solvent if we mark to market every one of their asset.

Seems like if we let the FED run these deposit and lending with 100% transparency about who was given loans at what terms, then we may have a stable system which is not on the verge of collapse every 10-15 years.

But there is a catch, it will make all deposits 100% safe, and that will stop investments. But I am wondering if we should stop pretending if that is a real problem. Let the FED handle all the requirements of lending, with 100% transparency.

Risk management,StockMarket,Why Do We Underestimate Black Swan Risks? [Managing Black Swan Risk Research Paper,"Read full:  [Strategies for Managing the Consequences of Black Swan Events | Leadership and Management in Engineering | Vol 9, No 4 (ascelibrary.org)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29LM.1943-5630.0000036) 

&#x200B;

 **Why Do We Underestimate Black Swan Risks?**

Behavioral scientists postulate that human experiences are often tainted with personal biases and formed from a rather limited time span of observations compared to the likelihood period of most extreme events. Consider the experience of people in the Indian Ocean region, who had likely never observed or even heard about tsunami, whether in normal discourse or in folklore. Except for a few experts almost no one was aware of their reality and considering the absence of any past observed occurrence or experience, no one had visualized this unusual event. The New Orleans residents had been through a lot of storms before hurricane Katrina and nothing that bad had ever happened. In hindsight, it is clear that there was no engineering redundancy that would save the residents if a large enough storm dumped water in short duration and the levees were breached. Could someone coming to work in the World Trade Center towers on the morning of September 11 have imagined the strange experiences of that day? Then, why are engineers often so dismissive of such scenarios until after they occur?

It may be because engineers do not like uncertainty and ambiguity, focus on specifics instead of generalities, and crave explicit explanations. Such thinking is shaped by their training in linear logic, whereas nearly all Black Swan events involve complex causal relationships. Taleb identifies five peculiarities of human behavior responsible for blindness to Black Swans:

&#x200B;

* Humans tend to categorize, focusing on preselected data that reaffirm beliefs as opposed to any contradictions (confirmation bias);
* Humans construct stories to explain events and see patterns in data when none exist, due to illusion of understanding (narrative fallacy);
* Human nature is not programmed to imagine Black Swans;
* Humans tend to ignore the silent evidence and focus disproportionately either on the failures or successes;
* Humans overestimate one’s knowledge and focus too narrowly on one’s field of expertise (tunnel vision), ignoring other sources of uncertainty, and mistaking concocted models for reality (ludic fallacy).

&#x200B;

These peculiarities of human behavior are illustrated here with examples from science and engineering, as opposed to Taleb’s general historical and financial focus.

&#x200B;

# Confirmation Bias

Confirmation bias refers to the human tendency to notice and look for what confirms one’s beliefs or prevailing dogma, and to ignore or undervalue the relevance of contradictions. For a long time, astronomers tried fitting observations to models for planetary movements in terms of cycles and epicycles in Ptolemy’s school of thought until the Copernican revolution overthrew old models. Still, his contemporaries rejected the new approach until Galileo’s ideas concerning motion finally confirmed their validity. Similarly, Einstein had to move beyond accepted wisdom to come up with his theory of relativity.

&#x200B;

# Illusion of Understanding or Narrative Fallacy

Narrative fallacy refers to a false sense of comfort from limited data observations, leading to wrong conclusions. Behavioral psychologists call this phenomenon “anchoring,” where one takes observed events and projects them into the future in a straight line. There are a host of studies that demonstrate this all-too-human tendency to assign patterns to random data and create descriptive narratives, resulting in focus on the mundane and missing the extraordinary. Pitfalls of projections from limited data were seen in stretching design parameters beyond limitations of the previous model, contributing to failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. NASA managers decided to launch the space shuttle *Challenger* during 30°F30°F conditions despite O-rings designed for the 40°F40°F to 90°F90°F range, resulting in its catastrophic failure.

&#x200B;

# Inherent Human Nature

It has been observed that humans are not programmed to deal with the trap of anticipation, waiting for some important event that is expected to occur infrequently. Nuclear operators are tasked with taking action during an elusive incident that usually never seems to happen. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has found that days, months and years of repeated nothingness can often lead to incidents when operators were found asleep on the job, most recently at the Peach Bottom Power Plant in Pennsylvania. In a July 2008 incident, three ballistic missile crew members fell asleep while holding classified launch code devices at Minot Air Force base in North Dakota. Numerous similar cases can be cited in the airline and marine industries, where nothing out of the ordinary is observed for long periods, and the deadly combination of fatigue and boredom ultimately leads to that sudden snap-through moment. Some of the most terrible eruptions have come from volcanoes that had been inactive since Holocene times. These examples show that “Risk never takes a holiday, even though it may appear excessively sleepy for long stretches.”

&#x200B;

# Silent Evidence

Silent evidence refers to the difference between the sample one constructs for analysis and the actual reality, causing systematic errors from ignoring evidence due to the manner of posing questions or biased sampling. Before boarding an airplane, crash risk of one in 1,000years1,000years somehow seems more acceptable than one out of 1,000 planes. Similarly, engineers drawing conclusions about the seismic behavior of a component from enumerating the failed components in field surveys would be ignoring the silent evidence provided by survival of thousands of similar components.

&#x200B;

# Ludic Fallacy

Humans have a tendency for tunnel vision, focusing on the known sources of uncertainty and ignoring the complexity of reality. As events that have not taken place can not be accounted for, one does not have adequate information for prediction, particularly since small variation in a variable can cause drastic impact (the butterfly effect in chaos theory). It is not the random uncertainty of probabilistic models (what Donald Rumsfeld called “known unknowns” or Taleb refers to as “Gray Swans”) but rather the epistemic uncertainty due to lack of knowledge (i.e., unknown unknowns; Black Swans) that is of prime concern. No probabilistic model based on *in-box* thinking can deal with *out-of-box* type events.",7,"It might be simpler than that. Maybe we don't ""underestimate"" them, maybe the risk is just too low for it to be practically useful to worry about them?

Like Rumsfeld said about his own mistakes in analysis; he was overly credulous of claims that known unknowns could be converted into known knowns.

Black Swans have to be known unknowns for your analysis to have meaning; the unknown unknowns can't be estimated ***at all*** so they can't be underestimated. They can only be overestimated. Things like hurricane risk in LA or tsunami risk in the Indian Ocean, those are definitely known unknowns.

The danger is exactly the trap Rumsfeld fell into; thinking you can turn the unknowns into knowns. Excess belief in the ability to estimate them is more dangerous than ignoring them in favor of the more common and useful known knowns.

The big problem with Hurricane Katrina was that the risk was known, but the money wasn't spent to prepare for it. Having better information about the risks wouldn't have helped, because the problems were mostly known knowns. Only the timing and name of the disaster were unknown. In the case of the tsunami, it is such a rare event that the local people didn't know about the risk, but also, the total number of people affected was small.",You just described the Federal Government for us. Thank you,"Super thorough.  Thanks for sharing.  In sum, many humans do not follow Lord Baden Powells motto:""always be prepared."" All of the non silver investors sing to the theme music of the Smurfs. It's one thing to be positive; however sometimes or oftentimes that positive mindset negates true reality"
Risk management,StockMarket,Would you use this TradingView Risk Management Indicator?,"Last week, I published a post titled, [Setting a Stop Loss for the New Day Trader](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/lpjmnq/setting_a_stop_loss_for_the_new_day_trader/). It stirred up a few comments, which motivated me to develop a TradingView indicator to show the stop loss and risk/reward, and also show position size based on predefined values for capital and level of risk (in percentage).

There's nothing proprietary about this risk management system, but what makes this indicator unique is the Risk % and position sizing. Most traders stick with a basic 1 or *2% Risk Rule*, where they will not risk more than 1 or 2% of their capital on any one trade. I went further and applied four levels of risk: 0.25%, 0.50%, 1% and 2%. How you apply these different levels of risk is what makes this indicator subjective and unique.

Here are some common ways on applying Risk %:

* If the stock is extremely volatile and has a better than 50% chance of hitting the stop loss, then risk only 0.25% of your capital on that trade.
* If a stock has low volatility and has less than 20% change of hitting the stop loss, then risk 2% of your capital on that trade.
* Risking anywhere between 0.25% and 2% is purely based on your intuition and assessment of the market.
* If you’re on a losing streak and you want to cut back on your position sizing, then lowering the Risk % can help you weather the storm.
* If you’re on a winning streak and your entries are experiencing a higher level of success, then increase gradually increase the Risk % to reap bigger profits.

If enough people show interest, then I will publish this on TradingView as a public indicator with the source code open to everyone. I welcome all feedback! Thanks.

Risk management,StockMarket,5 key ideas for risk management,"Having good risk management practices is fundamental to any trading or investing strategy, as it will help to keep potential losses in our pockets. As the Oracle of Omaha always puts it “Rule #1 is not to lose any money, and rule #2 is never to forget rule #1”. At the end of the game, long term success will only be achieved if we live to fight enough days and get the necessary experience.

With this in mind, here are five simple Risk Management tips that any trader or investor should take into account when navigating the markets.

1. Asset Allocation: This one applies more to an entire portfolio than a single trade. Essentially this means to diversify across the types of trade you hold at any given moment. The diversification can apply to different companies within an industry, different industries in general, even trades with different time horizons, or using puts and shorts to hedge positions.
2. Position Sizing: Position sizing refers to the portion of your complete account that you are using to buy an asset. If you are looking at the screen every second and twitching with every tick, then probably you have not developed the mindset to handle that amount of money. The good part is that if you are serious in becoming a trader, with every trade you make your tolerance goes up which allows you to keep placing bigger bets.
3. Buying in tranches: Basically this means not buying the full position in one go. You could buy in halves or thirds. This will allow you more time to manage a trade and make sure you are feeling comfortable, especially in tricky markets.
4. Use stop Losses: For traders we must keep in mind to take small losses quickly, for investors this is a bit less so. Depending on the strategy you can use different type of stops such as trailing stop losses either with percentages or absolute values. Hard stop losses which is an order at a specific price. Or closing day stops where you sell the next morning if a stock closes the day below a certain price.
5. Review your time horizon: there are many different strategies that are played in different time horizons. For example, day trading is extremely fast making multiple trades per day. Momentum and swing trading you hold either a day to a couple of weeks. Value investing you can hold anywhere from a couple of months to years. And finally things like dividend investing you would hold to forever.

Risk management,StockMarket,Question about risk and profit management,"Hi all, I've got to ask you about opinions and suggestions on my current risk and profit management.  


  
I've been using it about a while to a success but now I'm thinking that it might be tweaked a little.  


  
So basically I have four Risk Percent thresholds of possible losses: 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Each of these is correlated to Decimal Amount of profit (reward part of risk and reward), 10% is 0,25; 20% is 0,5; 30% is 1 and 40% is 2.  


When setting stop loss/take profit I first set my entry price. From that I calculate stop loss by doing simple equation: SL= Entry - (Entry \* Risk Percent).   


  
After SL is calculated I calculate take profit: TP= \[(Entry - SL)\* DecimalAmount \]+Entry  


So what do you guys think about it? I was thinking that I might be taking too little profit, especailly that I'm more of a swing/position trader.  
What would you guys suggest?",6,"I ignore price altogether and focus only on premium income. No stop losses because ultimately I end up with a zero cost basis which means everything is a profit or the stock runs. Those are my only two outcomes in ten years of trading this way. Even during the drop after covid, I ignored price and focused on premium. Bottom line, find a strategy that works for you. If you make money at a rate you are comfortable with then that's all that matters.",,

Investing in the stock market can be a great way to increase your wealth and financial security. But before you start investing, it’s important to understand the trends and patterns that drive the stock market. Analyzing stock market trends can help you make informed decisions about where and when to invest your money.

One of the most important things to look for when analyzing stock market trends is the overall direction of the market. This includes both short-term and long-term trends. Look for signs of whether the market is bullish, bearish, or somewhere in between. Pay attention to market indicators such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq Composite.

It’s also important to look at the performance of specific sectors. Different sectors perform differently during different market conditions. For example, the technology sector may do well during a bull market, while the energy sector may do better during a bear market. By understanding how different sectors are performing, you can make decisions about what stocks to invest in.

Another important trend to watch for when analyzing stock market trends is the performance of individual stocks. Pay attention to the performance of stocks you’re interested in investing in. Look at their performance over time, and pay attention to any news or announcements that could affect their performance. Also, keep an eye on the performance of other stocks in the same sector or industry. This can help you identify potential opportunities or risks.

Finally, it’s important to pay attention to economic indicators. Economic indicators provide insight into the overall health of the economy, and they can help you identify potential areas of opportunity or risk. Pay attention to indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, employment, and consumer spending. These can all provide valuable information about the overall direction of the economy and the stock market.

Market trends,StockMarket,Micro stock charts - a compact view of market action and trends,"Hi,

Quick background about me: I started trading a few years ago, eventually realised the importance of charts. Played around with generating stock chart ""snapshots"" as PNG pics to scan them quickly. My background is in software dev, but only recently started dabbling in websites. Decided to try building a website interface for these micro stock charts (I'm aware of Reddit rules against self promotion, that's not my intent here). I'm just starting out with paid Ads etc to test the waters.

There are plenty of complex charting tools out there, but I've felt something simpler could be built for quick chart viewing. I've also seen sites that show multiple charts in one page, which are good but I wanted something where you can load say 50 or 100 micro charts at once for quick viewing/comparisons/trend-watching, with easy switching between time periods and chart types.

As an example, I've attached a screenshot showing a 5Y view on the left and a 10Y view on the right. These are the top NASDAQ companies sorted by Market Cap.  I've highlighted the Covid dip that affected most stocks, and you can see the recent bull run happening this year from a high level. The top 5 charts are incredibly similar, viewing them in a vertical/scrolling format. I'm in Aus so mainly trade the ASX.

Any thoughts in general about this micro stock charts idea? Do you think they're useful to view trends across the market quickly? What sort of layout would you prefer?

Any opinions or feedback appreciated, good or bad! Good luck trading.

Market trends,StockMarket,Pharmaceuticals break COVID lows trend line signaling end to Bear Market,"1. Just because you can't make money using technicals doesn't mean they don't work. Take your bags elsewhere.

I use Pharmaceuticals as a bit of a canary in the coal mine for the end of a bear market. For the first time since 2021 Pharma has signaled that the bear market may be at an end.

I use ABBV as my go to, I think it's one of the strongest Pharmas without too many legal headaches which is a rare combination considering the field.

Pharma and Utilities are usually the last to ""puke"" in a bear market. In every major bear market back to the 1970s, they typically held their gains through the entirety of the bear market, then puked sometimes dumping 50% after everything else had long bottomed. It's a weird phenomenon for those two sectors.

There's a ""bull trend line"" formed by the covid era that ABBV respected until this week. Thus, it has finally ""puked"".

How hard it will dump is yet to be seen. The final test for the bear market is for the SPX to retest the 200week which will be somewhere around SPX 3900 in October which is 80% of the time the typical retest zone where everyone starts to feel the burn and panic.

80% of bear markets waterfall down in that period due to it being the end Fiscal Calendar cycle.

So I fully expect we'll see SPX 3900 again some point by then. Pharma and utilities are usually the best buys in decades when they hit that bottom while an already 'recovering market' has began its climb and is retesting the 200week.

So if anyone's interested in Pharma, I'd star watching but not buying yet.

Economic indicators,StockMarket,"I used AI, behavioural economics and alternative data to create a stock market indicator","For the past couple of months Ive been working on a bellwether indicator for the stock market. I used insights from behavioral economics, an alternative dataset and AI to turn this in to practice. Below I worked out the thought process behind the indicator which I wanted to share and bounce ideas off.

&#x200B;

 The thought proces behind the indicator is divided in to the three components already mentioned, a behavioural psychology part, an alternative big data part and the AI part. Or just scroll down to see the final result compared to the S&P 500.

**The psychology part**

The fact that you are more cautious when you just witnessed an accident is called availability bias in the school of behavioural finance. It describes the notion that people judge the probability of something happening more likely when an example more easily comes to mind. So for example you probably overestimate the probability of a shark attack when you have just read about in the news. You could argue that the same goes for economic principles. People are more likely to believe inflation is coming when the news is full of it. Or that a recession is coming when everyone is tweeting about it. Or that a stock is going up when its all over Reddit. Point is that news can drive the market, rather than just report or follow on it. In this respect also the recent work of Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller is relevant. His book Narrative Economics describes how stories can propel economic events. But how can one assess what people are reading, or what news they are exposed to? This is where alternative data and AI play their part.

**The alternative data part**

Traditional finance data is usually nice to work with, it is clean, nicely structured and most data is readily available. Unfortunately that is also it’s drawback, since everyone is looking at it, it is hard to gain an edge. Alternative data however usually is instructed and messy, but it is unique. One of the largest alternative data sources is the internet. Terabytes of data are generated every minute and with this indicator we want to take advantage of that.

Therefore I created a dataset with financial news articles from well know websites, financial tweets and other sources of financial news combined to one large dataset with unstructured alternative data. With this data we can see to what news investors are exposed to. And here is the cool thing, if we think about our behavioural flaws discussed in the first part, we can make a prediction as to where investors’ availability bias is headed to. Put differently, is we know if investors are reading more negative or positive news, we can try to predict if their investment decisions will be positive (i.e. long) or if they will be negative (i.e. short). Unfortunately going through all this data and seeing for every news article, tweet etc whether it’s positive or negative is quite undoable. But here is the good news, we can let a computer do that and that is where the AI part comes in.

**The AI part**

AI is getting smarter and smarter almost daily it seems. And more importantly, big AI libraries are available to everyone with a computer running Python. Google (TensorFlow) and Facebook (PyTorch) are so kind to make their AI libraries open source, which puts some really powerful tools at the tips of your fingers. In this case we will let AI do two tasks:

\- Read headlines (ML zero shot sentiment classification)

\- Predict returns over a certain horizon

For this paper we will only discuss the first task, the next one is for another post.

To summarize the first two steps, first we discussed how people are influenced by what they read, second we showed that with alternative data we obtain what they read. The next (and hardest) part is actually reading and classifying. Since we have about 1000 daily news articles we have to let a computer to this, which we do by means of AI/Machine learning. We can use a model that is trained to classify a string of text as either optimistic (scoring it with a max of +1) to pessimistic (scoring it with a minimum of -1). How we do this is quite technical and will be explained in a different post, but the end result is a dataset of more than a million articles classified from +1 (optimistic) to -1 (pessimistic). Now the final step, checking whether the theory we proposed in the first part holds any truth when checking the data.

**Tying it all together**

So to recap, academic research shows how news can influence investor sentiment, we have alternative (big) data that contains all this news, and we have a computer that can interpret that news faster than any human can. You can check out how this graphically looks on: 

[https://www.alternative-analytics.eu/indicators/](https://www.alternative-analytics.eu/indicators/)

&#x200B;

The dashed line shows the S&P500, the other one our sentiment indicator. The vertical axis shows sentiment (negative to positive) and the horizontal axis is time. You can clearly see how sentiment was already decreasing before the market collapsed under COVID fear. Interestingly you also sentiment improving before the market recovered. So at the least we can see from that this plot that there is a relation between our indicator and S&P stock prices. This shows how new technology and improvement in AI is giving us a new way for looking at the market.",620,"""People are more likely to believe inflation is coming when the news is full of it. Or that a recession is coming when everyone is tweeting about it. Or that a stock is going up when its all over Reddit. ""

You may want to do a deeper dive on the ""who"" behind the tweets and posts. Just because people are talking about something doesn't mean that they are intending for the stock to go that way - e.g. hyping up a stock when a big player is looking to cash out and conversely, trashing a stock when a big player is trying to get in cheap. You saw a lot of the former with a lot of the escalated messaging around the reddit meme stocks. I can't say that this was nefarious agenda pushing or just the equivalent of the barber giving stock advice, but the same holds true anyways. Social media gives everyone a voice with the false pretense of everyone's voice requiring the same value.

To your datasets:

\- Structured finance data is your gold standard.

\- Alternative datasets are fine, but might impose a LOT of noise due to variability. Then again, not sure what kind of datasets you're working with here.

\- People tweeting and redditing. This is a project in itself. You're doing classification, semantic analysis and content filtering and general analysis on account ""truthiness""

Finally... correlation is one thing. You're looking for causal. The way the HFT traders do this is intercept where the money is going and just assume that big money = big money already did the hard research part and they know something. They basically let everyone else do the hard work and open up shop next door (cough..cough..BurgerKing)

Where are the aha/trade-able moments on your graph.",So it looks like there has been a recent sizable drop in sentiment.

trade,StockMarket,Hawley introduces Pelosi Act banning lawmakers from trading stocks,"Sen. Josh Hawley has introduced a bill that would ban members of Congress from trading and owning stocks, using the name of his legislation to take a jab at Rep. Nancy Pelosi

Hawley on Tuesday introduced the Pelosi Act — or the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act — renewing a legislative push to curtail stock trading by lawmakers that has failed over the last few years.

“Members of Congress and their spouses shouldn’t be using their position to get rich on the stock market,” Hawley tweeted in announcing his bill.

The GOP senator previously introduced legislation last year seeking to ban lawmakers and their spouses from holding stocks or making new transactions while in office.

The Hill has reached out to Pelosi’s office for comment.

Hawley, like a number of other Republicans, has focused on the former Speaker and her family in pushing to ban stock trading by members of Congress.

Last year Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, sold millions of dollars worth of shares of a computer chipmaker as the House prepared to vote on a bill focused on domestic chip manufacturing. A spokesman for Pelosi said at the time that he sold the shares at a loss.

Members of both parties signaled interest in legislation barring stock trades after then-Sen. Richard Burr, who at the time was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, unloaded stocks at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently closed a probe of his trading activities without taking action.

Lawmakers have yet to be able to come up with a plan that garners enough support from both sides of the aisle to get a bill through Congress. Democrats in 2022 scrapped a plan to vote on such legislation before the midterm elections, even after Pelosi reversed course and expressed openness to colleagues voting for stock trading reform.

Along with Hawley’s bill, a bipartisan duo in the House has introduced a bill this year on the topic. Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Chip Roy introduced the Trust in Congress Act this month, marking the third time the pair have introduced the legislation.

trade,StockMarket,"BREAKING: China & Brazil have agreed to trade in their own currencies, ditching the US dollar.","If more countries start to trade in their own currencies, it could reduce the demand for the dollar. This could lead to a weaker dollar.

China and Brazil have agreed to conduct their trade and financial transactions using their own currencies, ditching the US dollar as an intermediary. 

They will be exchanging yuan for reais, and vice versa, instead of going through the US dollar

This is part of China's efforts to reduce its reliance on the US dollar as the world's major reserve currency and to promote the use of its own currency, the Yuan.

China is Brazil's biggest trading partner, with two-way trade hitting over $150 billion last year.

The deal is expected to reduce costs, promote greater bilateral trade, and facilitate investment. 

China has similar currency deals with Russia and Pakistan.

My personal opinion is that China does not have a transparent central banking system.

The US dollar became the world reserve currency after World War II when the US emerged as the world's leading economic power.

In 1944, following the Bretton Woods Agreement, 44 nations agreed to adopt the U.S. dollar as an official reserve currency.

The US dollar is likely to remain the world reserve currency for the foreseeable future. 

It is a stable and reliable currency, and it is widely accepted around the world.",1284,How much of this post was written by ChatGPT?,They will trade in their own currencies and then just exchange it for USD because they realize the currency they got is poop,"They are trading mud for dogshit. If you have problem trusting the FED and the US government with USD, good luck trusting Winnie The Pooh and the CCCP with the Yuan. 

The reality is that today there is no alternative to the USD as a reserve currency. The war in Ukraine and China clamping down on entrepreneurs and going full 1984 have clearly shown that the US is still firmly in power as the world’s military and (more importantly here) economic superpower. EUR and GBP are the closest reserves to USD, but again the ineffectiveness of ECB / BoE in raising rates has shown that the USD is still the leader by far. 

I think there is a CLEAR need for an alternative to thE USD, as the world has been rarely more polarized than today. However there is no credible alternative yet. Gold? Bitcoin? Maybe, but they are not a credible alternative today.

And before some China bootlicker downvotes me - no, I am not American nor I live in the US. If you like the Yuan, I encourage you to get exposed to it by converting all your savings into Yuan and trusting the CCCP to have your future in their best interest."

Do i think everything will crash tomorrow and all of our beloved penny stonks will turn our portfolios a deep red? I would say it's about a 30% chance imo. Not too high, but we DEFINITELY need to be aware of this economic event on Friday.

Reason being, the private ADP report came out on tuesday. When i traded forex, i used this as a clue as to how the nonfarm payroll report would go. Nonfarm payroll has a big impact on the usd and the overall market in general.

The ADP National Employment Report measures levels of non-farm private employment. The Report is based on the actual payroll data from about 24 million employees processed by the Automatic Data Processing, Inc. 

The estimates were 1.5mil new jobs in the private sector for july. the report came out with ....167,000 new jobs..

To me, this means that the nonfarm payroll report tomorrow is going to miss in a BIG way. I also think the unemployment rate MIGHT be higher than expected tomorrow too. IMO tomorrow will be a red day with some of these stocks potentially dropping >20%.

However, if the politicians come out tomorrow and announce the approval of the 2nd tendies package, we will all be saved. i'm expecting them to reach a deal monday or tuesday of next week though.

Plan accordingly and stay safe! Tomorrow we play defense",76,I thought the unemployment report came out today,I feel like in the next few weeks the number of robinhooders and retail investors is gonna tank a lot of college kids like me have started gamblevesting for fun during quarantine but that’s gonna stop with school starting back up.

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.)",I bought 4k worth of OCUGEN stock at .19 and sold it at .21. A few weeks later it hit $10,"$ENZC traded in the low .000s and fell just short of a dollar. Had you bought in at .0004 and rode it out to just .04, that's a 100x gain (That's 100 bagger, not 100%). And from that point on, every .04 gain was 100x return from your original entry point. If you got out at .92, that would have been a 100x gain 23x times over, or 2,300x your initial investment, or a 23,000% gain.

Pretty crazy? That doesn't even come close to what $TSNP (now $HMBL) did. You could have bought in at .0004 back in late 2020, but not only did that one break $1 but it actually hit $7 at it's peak! Every single .04 gain was a 100 bagger, so that's 175 100 baggers!

I've been trading the OTC markets for a living since 2006 and there are life changing moves like this every year basically. They're rare but they absolutely happen and all it takes is one to change your life. I've made a living off of catching a handful of small winners and sometimes I go a year or two without catching anything substantial, but again all it takes is one big winner to make up for all the time waiting, watching and plotting. IMO the waiting and hunting is where the real money is made, nothing happens on your watch so the key is patience - on top of obviously knowing what to look for. Far from easy, but nothing that pays off that well is going to be easy. That being said, it's not easy but it's very possible in theory.

Edit: I believe I forgot a zero and that would be a 230,000% return?"

Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Gap and Go Trading Strategy Guide,"Gap trading is one of the most poplar ways to day trade because there are countless different gap trading strategies and gaps offer great trading opportunities every day! One of the most popular ways to trade gaps is to look for and buy into what is known as a **gap and go.**

Before getting into the gap and go trading strategy itself, I want to start from the basics and first explain what a gap in the stock market is. A **gap** is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It's an empty space on a stock's chart caused by a lack of trading activity. This happens most commonly on a daily chart. The reason for this is because daily charts generally do not show price action during extended hours trading *(pre market and after hours),* so when a stock makes a large move to the upside during extended hours it is known as a **gap up**, and when a stock makes a large move down in extended hours it is known as a **gap down**. Companies generally will release news and press releases during extended hours, which is almost always the cause of any major gap in either direction.

[https://imgur.com/a/BuSe6Jh](https://imgur.com/a/BuSe6Jh) 

Many traders don't like the thought of trading gaps because they believe the stock has already made its move during extended hours and by trading it after the market open they'd be too late. As someone that day trades full-time and focusses primarily on trading small cap gap plays, I can promise you that this is not true! Even though gaps have already made large moves, they still offer the best day trade opportunities because of the increased volume and volatility that they typically come with.

Realistically, the problem is that most new traders are not taught to trade gaps properly. Like I said, there are many different ways to trade gaps, both long and short. Each way of trading gaps will require different methods of analysis and entering/exiting the stock.

Regardless, the first step in any gap trading strategy is to... **find gaps**! Don't worry, I make this part easy for you because I share a Morning Watchlist every morning during pre market with the largest gaps, along with other important information such as the news headline that caused the gap, the number of shares outstanding, nearest support, and nearest resistance levels! 

After you've found the biggest gaps for the morning, the next step is going to be to find which ones are most likely to gap and go. Since many stocks gap up and come straight back down, this part of the gap trading strategy is very important. After years of trading gaps myself, the criteria below is what I look for when determining which stocks are more likely to gap and go! Of course, like anything in the market, this isn't going to lead to a gap and go 100% of the time, but it should definitely keep you from buying into the worst performing gaps.

**1. A Strong Catalyst:** A catalyst like a piece of news released by a company is most likely to be cause of any major gap. The strength of that news often plays a big role in whether or not the stock is able to gap and go. Now, there's no exact measurement for how ""strong"" a catalyst is, but you definitely know that positive drug/treatment trial results is a much bigger deal than a minor product patent. It's also important to know what makes an earnings report strong because earnings are the cause of many gap, both up and down.

**2. No Recent Dilution:** Dilution can be a big red flag for potential buyers and investors. In its simplest form, it's essentially a large amount of added supply to the market. Unless there is some serious demand for the stock, all of that additional supply will likely drive the stock's price down and will make it much more difficult for the stock to gap and go. In my opinion, no matter what type of trading strategy you're using, you should always check a website like [sec.gov](https://sec.gov/) or [bamsec.com](http://bamsec.com/) to see if the company has recent diluted or done any offerings. If you see a recent offering, that stock is likely to be a better opportunity to short-sell than buy.

**3. Strong Chart History:** History repeats itself! You can often look at a stock's long term chart *(1 year to 3 year)* to see how well it performed on other days that it has gapped up in the past. A stock that is in a long-term downtrend and regularly comes straight back down after a gap up is much less likely to gap and go than a stock that is in a long term uptrend and held held onto gains from past gap ups. Look for a bullish chart history for the highest probability of a gap and go.

[https://imgur.com/a/x8Ilv3j](https://imgur.com/a/x8Ilv3j) 

**4. Limited Nearby Resistance:** If a stock has little *(or even no)* overhead resistance, it's going to be more likely to gap and go. Resistance levels are prices where a stock historically struggles to break above due to stronger supply *(selling)* than demand *(buying)*. If there are multiple nearby levels of resistance, those prices can get in the way and prevent a stock from continuing to run after a gap up. While looking for nearby resistance, I primary analyze the 1 and 5 minute chart to look for any resistance that was formed during pre market on the day of the gap up, as well as the daily chart to find any major resistance levels from the past.

Those are the four main things that you want to se when analyzing gaps and looking for the next big gap and go. Again, these four filters are going to lead to a huge gap and go 100% of time, but they definitely won't lead you to buy into the worst performing gaps! I hope this post gives you some insight on how you can strategically trade gaps and profit from the gap and go strategy.

Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Penny stocks: definition and 4 trading strategies to master in 2023,"For traders in the stock market, penny stocks are worth exploring due to their high volatility and potential for higher returns with less capital. However, it is important to note that penny stocks are not necessarily for long-term investors. It is recommended for beginners to learn the fundamentals before trading penny stocks.

## Penny Stocks Definition

 The term ""penny stock"" usually refers to a small company's stock that costs $5 or less. These stocks are often associated with the Over-The-Counter Exchange, but some are traded on major exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq. There have been many examples of penny stocks that have increased dramatically in value, such as AMC Entertainment and Nokia. In 2023, there are many opportunities for active investors to profit from cheap stocks that are experiencing significant growth. 

## How To Trade Penny Stocks

 The article discusses how trading penny stocks is different from trading larger market capitalization companies like Apple and Tesla. Shorter time horizons are typically used for penny stock trading, but there is potential for longer-term investments. The goal is to make money with penny stocks, so learning different trading styles can be helpful. The article explores various techniques that active traders use to make money with penny stocks. 

## Day Trading 

 Day trading involves buying and selling securities within the same trading day, with the position being closed before the end of the day. The rise of retail traders has led to more day trading liquidity in the market, which is important for entering and exiting trades easily. This is especially important for those using day trading strategies to make money in the stock market. 

### Scalping

 Another type of trading strategy is scalping, which is similar to day trading but involves buying and selling within a very short period to take advantage of small moves in share prices. Scalpers aim for frequent, small gains rather than big ones, and need high liquidity to quickly enter and exit trades. 

## Swing Trading

 Penny stocks can experience rapid price changes, leading many retail traders to engage in day trading. However, some penny stocks continue to rise for days or even months, and swing trading is a strategy used to take advantage of these opportunities. Unlike day traders, swing traders actively seek out trades that can be held overnight. This approach is popular among those who have other commitments and cannot monitor the market all day. It is important to be aware that penny stocks can be volatile and unpredictable. 

 Companies can benefit from rising share prices by offering stocks at a discounted price through overnight financing deals with their banker. Swing traders need to be cautious and properly hedged because these offerings are not typically announced beforehand, especially when dealing with penny stocks. 

## Momentum Trading with Penny Stocks

 Momentum trading can be used for penny stocks and involves using technical analysis tools such as trend lines and moving averages to identify stocks with strong price trends. Proper risk management and careful monitoring of positions are important due to the volatility of these stocks. Making timely decisions to enter and exit trades is crucial for success in this strategy. 

## Growth Investing with Penny Stocks

 Growth investing in penny stocks involves finding companies with great potential for growth in the future. This approach requires analyzing the financial stability, potential for growth, competitive advantages, and industry trends of the company. This strategy can offer significant returns, but it comes with higher risks due to investing in small and less-established companies. Having patience and a long-term perspective is crucial, as the growth potential of penny stocks may take time to materialize. 

## Hold A Core, Trade A Core

 The ""Hold A Core, Trade A Core"" approach is a trading style that combines long-term investment with short-term trading. It is commonly used by traders who want to invest in a company for the long run but also take advantage of short-term trends in penny stocks. 

 A trader invests in PubCo A at $2 because they believe it has potential. The share price rises to $2.50, so the trader buys more and their average cost becomes $2.30. When the price reaches $3.50, the trader sells some shares to make a profit and waits for the price to drop before buying back in. This strategy helps the trader keep their overall investment cost lower than the current market price and take advantage of short-term opportunities. 

 The ""Hold A Core, Trade A Core"" strategy was very successful for those who wanted to profit from the huge increase in Novavax stock from the beginning of 2020 to early 2021. This strategy is also known as ""tier trading"" or cost averaging and is a popular example of investing in penny stocks. 

## Are Penny Stocks Worth It?

 When considering investing in penny stocks, it is important to be careful, do thorough research, and seek advice from a financial professional. Penny stocks are risky and speculative, so they are only suitable for investors who are willing to take on those risks. However, with the right strategy and market knowledge, penny stocks can be profitable. It's important to remember that not every trade needs to be a big win, and the goal is always to make a profit.",3,"

Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Do you have a trading strategy? Why not?,"I think this is a discussion that needs to be had. I am a reasonably long time lurker of the sub and have definitely seen my share of profits from some of the tickers posted here (PLEASE always do your own DD, no matter how hype a post may seem, if its all positive, it isn't real DD).   


As some background I will admit that I am in a lucky position compared to most, I recently sold one of my houses and ended up with a bit over $100k in liquid capital to play around with, so, I quit my job and took up trading full time after spending several months full-time teaching myself the ins and outs.  


I by no means claim to be an expert and as far as investing goes I am still pretty green, but in my 6 months\~of active trading I am up over 20% and consistently trading a profit each week.  


The biggest issue I see on this sub is that most people have jumped right into this about as recently as me but with little to no research or practice, little to no understanding of the market or terminology and most importantly, NO TRADING STRATEGY!  


This is the big one and what I want to talk about, because I am curious what % of this sub actually have a trading strategy they adhere too? Do you have profit margins? Stop losses? Risk margins? How long do you hold your trades?  


They say 90% of day traders lose money and can you be surprised when it seems nobody wants to spend any time developing a working strategy for themselves and instead just want to blindly gamble on stocks or follow the latest trend. If trading purely on trend and credit post tickers was a way to consistently make money, don't you think EVERYONE would do it? Have some sense and think for yourself, if you want to make money, you need to figure out what works for YOU and implement consistently.

&#x200B;

YOU THERE! HOLDING ALL THOSE BAGS AND TRYING TO SLINK AWAY I SEE YOU, DONT IGNORE ME!

&#x200B;

DEVELOPING A PERSONALISED STRATEGY:  
I think the most important thing to any trading strategy is personalisation, your strategy needs to suit YOU and your own mentality / capital. What trading strategy works for me, will almost definitely not be the same for you, there will likely be similarities, but that's the trick to ensuring you stick to your strategies. Having a touch of personalisation will make it feel like its YOURS, your idea, your strategy and as such you will be more inclined to stick to it (psychology 101).  


Make sure when developing a trading strategy that you WRITE IT DOWN (on paper preferably) then stick it somewhere you can see it constantly. Whenever you are about to open/close a trade, look at your strategy and ask yourself ""Am I following my strategy or am I acting emotionally?"" if you are about to lock in a trade and it doesn't match your trading strategy, its probably a bad trade and your past self is trying to warn you, listen to these warnings to be profitable long term.  


MY PERSONAL TIPS:  
\-Dont't be greedy with your strategy, set a reasonable and achievable goal to start with and make sure you can hit that goal consistently for several weeks/months before altering a trading plan.  


\-Make sure your strategy has stop losses and profit targets in place (THIS IS MASSIVE) give yourself a profit target, be it 5%, 10%, 20% or more and STICK to it. If you are in a position and you hit your target, take the profit and move on. If you really want to continue with that stock, wait for a dip and REAPPLY your strategy, with stop loss and profit target from your new entry point.   
DO NOT START IGNORING YOUR TRADING STRATEGY FOR ANY REASON, AS SOON AS YOU BREAK THE RULE ONCE, YOU WILL DO IT AGAIN AND YOUR STRATEGY IS WORTHLESS.  


MY BASIC PERSONAL STRATEGY: (Take with a grain of salt, develop your own it will be better)  
RISK:  no more than 1% total capital per trade (e.g your total capital is $1000, if you buy 200 shares @ $1, stop loss would be -$10.)  
P/L target: 2:1 profit loss target (e.g total capital $1000, for each -$10 stop loss, have a profit target of $20)  
Time stop: If a position fails to meet P/L target exit one week.  
Entry points: -0.05% below MKT for buy, 0.04% above for sell  
VOLUME: Min 200,000/day  
What works for me may not work for you, but one thins is for sure, you need something that works for you, and you need to STICK TO IT.

Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Why Having a Penny Stocks Trading Strategy is Critical to Success," 3 Reasons to Use a Penny Stocks Trading Strategy in 2023

 Having a penny stocks trading strategy is critical for 2023, as it can help to identify profitable opportunities and reduce risk in a highly volatile market. [Penny stocks](https://pennystocks.com/penny-stocks-trading/) are highly speculative investments with the potential to generate huge returns, but they also carry high risks. By having a well-defined trading strategy in place before executing any trades, investors can better manage their risk exposure and more accurately anticipate any potential profits or losses .

 A good penny stocks trading strategy should take into account various factors, such as the current market conditions, economic data releases, and news from the stock itself. Analyzing these elements can provide valuable insight into whether the stock is likely to rise or fall in value over time. Additionally, studying technical indicators such as support and resistance levels and trend lines can help investors make more informed decisions.

 Having a diversified portfolio of penny stocks is also essential when trading these securities. This means investing in a range of different stocks to spread risk across various sectors, industries, and countries. Diversification can also help minimize losses in the event that one stock performs poorly. Additionally, it is important to maintain an appropriate amount of cash on hand in case market conditions change quickly or any unexpected events arise.

 Following a well-thought-out [penny stocks trading](https://pennystocks.com/featured/2022/12/23/new-years-penny-stocks-advice/) strategy and maintaining a diversified portfolio are key elements of successful investing for 2023. By taking into account all available data points, investors can better manage their risk exposure and increase their chances of earning higher returns from their penny stocks. With this in mind, let’s take a look at why having a penny stocks trading strategy is critical right now.

It uses the VWAP, 30 EMA and 200 EMA applied to the 4 hour or daily time frame. The 30 and 200 EMA are used to identify the trend direction and to filter out ranges together with the ATR.

When the 30 EMA is above the 200 EMA we are in an uptrend and when the 30 EMA is below the 200 EMA we are in a downtrend. When the spread of the exponential moving averages is larger than the average true range multiplied with a discretionary factor we are in a trend and when it is smaller we are in a range. This mechanism is used to filter the ranges.

Once we identified that we are in a trend we use the VWAP to find a pullback and use that to enter into the direction of the trend.

The take profit is set by multiplying the average true range with a discretionary factor. For the stop loss the strategy uses a trailing stop loss.

You can adjust all the parameters in the TradingView script and use it to run backtests or to get trade signals on different assets.

I have created a video tutorial explaining how and why this strategy works in detail as well as how to use the accompanying TradingView script for backtesting and live trading:

Options trading,PennyStocks,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

[https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU](https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU) 

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

Options trading,PennyStocks,Options For Trading Options,"Options For Trading Options

For the Options Traders 

Same old story out there on Wednesday, buy re-opening, sell high growth/tech. Institutional sweepers continue to plow into inflation/reflation leaders, while the bulk of the put buying remains focused on ETFs and growth.

$United Airlines Holdings Inc(UAL.US)$, $Las Vegas Sands Corp(LVS.US)$, $Boeing Co(BA.US)$, $Exxon Mobil Corp(XOM.US)$, $ONEOK Inc(OKE.US)$, financials and travel leaders have been absolutely tattooed over the past couple of weeks.

On the sentiment front

Recent volatility hasn't had a noteworthy impact on intermediate-term sentiment yet but the selling has been in just half of the market so far.

Hedge funds spit up a bit, trimming some of their recent long exposure after getting a bit more aggressive buying into this recent dip.

Institutions are still primarily focused on this ""re-opening"" theme but continue to plow into the leaders for the most part. There has been some recent activity in underbelly commodity plays like $Teck Resources Ltd(TECK.US)$ and $Amyris Inc(AMRS.US)$ yesterday but we haven't seen many fresh names, the most aggressive aspect of the flow has been in the more well-known cyclical plays.

That will change, eventually, there's still a potential drawdown risk across the board here because the more they hammer growth, the higher the odds they'll need to sell winners as well to meet margin calls. Our best entry for swing positions will likely come off the selling where everything is highly correlated. In other words, when everything finally pulls back together with the indices and there's nowhere to hide, this phase can come to an end.

But when will that come? NO CLUE, for now, a tactical strategy remains the way to go, they are not really showing much excitement in growth yet, selectively dabbling for just a bounce.",1,"

Fundamental analysis,PennyStocks,Fundamental vs. Technical Analysis with Penny Stocks,"Penny stocks offer substantial return potential, with two main approaches: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.

**Fundamental analysis** delves into a company's financial health, operational efficiency, and long-term potential. It relies on concrete data from financial statements and earnings reports, reducing the need for market speculation. This approach is valuable for identifying undervalued penny stocks poised for long-term growth and assesses a company's competitive position within its industry.

**Technical analysis** is well-suited for the fast-paced nature of penny stock trading. It involves analyzing price patterns, trends, and trading volumes to capitalize on short-term market movements. Visual representations using charts and technical indicators help identify optimal entry and exit points. This approach encourages a proactive trading style, particularly valuable in the volatile penny stock market, where quick reactions to emerging trends can lead to profitable opportunities.

Both approaches have their merits, and the choice depends on an investor's goals, risk tolerance, and trading style. A strong understanding of both methodologies, coupled with disciplined application and risk management, is crucial for success in the penny stock market.

**In conclusion**, neither fundamental nor technical analysis holds a definitive edge in trading penny stocks. The choice between the two should align with the investor’s goals, trading style, and risk tolerance. A clear understanding of both methodologies, coupled with disciplined application and risk management, is key to navigating the complexities of penny stock trading and achieving success in this challenging yet potentially rewarding market.",5,"

There are a few well known, accurate indicators but oftentimes people will use obscure ones just to justify their trades. “This is a clear bull testicle McDonald’s flag, buy now.” On top of that, TA is susceptible to market conditions like the crash on Thursday, and while fundamental analysis is also vulnerable to that, the fundamentals say it will bounce back eventually.","TA on penny stocks is not nearly as accurate as TA on more expensive stocks, most are pump and dumps","When I first started out, I just used fundamental, now I'm 75% technical but if there's isn't a fundamental reason to get in, I don't."

At daily time frame DOWNTREND is broken it can start of UPTREND. 

The TA is made on half day of opening of market.

But as you see at graphs support is worked nicely. If support will hold the price at that support level(I showed in picture) we can see UPTREND. 

Also according to ichimoku on 4H chart we can see UPTREND in short term. 

I also made FİB. 

Anaylsis which is very important. You can see levels at graph. 

I showed support and resistance levels. 

For me Daily graph is so important and it is on beginning of uptrend starting from today where is expected to grow average 5%-10% in next 2-3 weeks where is expected to hit 0.3$ per share.

Technical analysis,PennyStocks,Technical Analysis for $RXMD $DTGI $MEDXF $ALPP,"Quick TA for these stocks. 

[RXMD is consolidating well in this white box, volume profile is developing well to get good support for future pushes. RSI has reset to neutral levels from overbought and money flow is heading back bullish. Earnings are next week so watch for this to break out and retest all time high. ](https://preview.redd.it/j64nno0s6fp61.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ff416f1e04bfa3ef720181d1773270d06e5dda)

[DTGI currently trading at .179 pulling back from its recent run, however, looking at the  accd \(grey indicator\) the sell volume is very little. This can also be seen with the volume bars on the lower end of the chart. Low sell volume days to get flipped out and consolidate in this 14-18 cent range and then retest a break out. The yellow ema ribbon and 50 sma are catching up and will also begin to act as support in the coming days. News will be the catalyst for that break out, or influx of buyers. These low volume days can seem bad but higher lows are being made on each candle again. Watch for a break of .20 to retest the all the high above. Be on the look out for Continued accumulation. The upper ema ribbon just turned down, looking like the stock will want to chop in this area for a few sessions. ](https://preview.redd.it/nxhu7d006fp61.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=114e6ac34a1b31a404fef884e530b0b43dfa1ea7)

[MEDXF consolidating in this range with a solid support now from the volume profile PoC. This can look to push above the yellow box and retest its all time high in the coming days, nasdaq uplist is suspected within the next month. Red candles are not indicative of actual price action, a lot of the volume during the days are buys but the stock closing red on low size sells. If this breakout fails look to enter in the mid 5's for it to keep consolidating in the channel. The SMA is now acting as a big support here and we can see the stock potentially ride that up. ](https://preview.redd.it/8m94zdoz6fp61.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5872079951cf0fafe213005966cf76a84a8c1e9)

[ALPP has been beaten down by bad market days. As seen with the accd there still are not a lot of sellers, it is mostly low volume days that are pushing the stock lower and lower. Look to see if this are can hold and potentially come back and retest the upper ribbon. Currently the short term ema ribbon is bearish but can flip on one good day. NASDAQ uplist should be in the next few days and can provide the volume needed to re enter the bullish zone \(5.1+\) ](https://preview.redd.it/oz36lh8c7fp61.png?width=1948&format=png&auto=webp&s=da5c45fb2573e859d3bbfd278f38dd47a45bda42)",237,"

Technical analysis,PennyStocks,GMBL Technical Analysis & Price Targets - Massive Upside Potential,"Good morning everyone! I hope your Monday went well yesterday! Today, I bring you the TA & PTs for GMBL. Communicated disclaimer, nfa.  Let's jump into it.

**Firstly,** here are my short-term price targets

1. .1132
2. .1191
3. .1221
4. .1251 (12.78% gains)

**& Secondly,** here are my longer-term price targets

1. .1463
2. .20
3. .2754
4. .3101

[GMBL1D](https://preview.redd.it/dp759b18j7pb1.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&s=a749cfe5d76099504706404ca15364399264fc7a)

So, obviously, those longer-term price targets would be AMAZING if they hit, but those are probably very far away in the long term.

For the chart, **here is what you are looking at**

* an over sold RSI (typically means due for a reversal)
* a rocketing daily volume (this typically signals a big move is coming)
* beat down price action (IMO, we have a lot more potential for upside at this rate than downside)
* the horizontal lines are support & resistance levels

**My final thoughts**

This stock is oversold and has massive upswing potential. Is this a guarantee? No. Am I saying it WILL happen? No. Do I think that at this point we have decent enough odds and good risk:reward levels that it is at least worth looking into? Yes!

Switch to fundamental analysis. That actually has merit."
Technical analysis,PennyStocks,How to use Technical Analysis when Trading Penny Stocks,"**Introduction**

Technical analysis is a key strategy used by traders, particularly those dealing with penny stocks, which are generally defined as stocks with a share price below $5. This method involves the study of statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movements and volume. Unlike fundamental analysis which focuses on a company's financial health and market position, technical analysis is primarily concerned with patterns within stock charts, believing that past trading activity can predict future price behavior.

**Scalping and Momentum Trading**

Scalping is a strategy that can be especially useful in penny stock trading. In scalping, traders aim to take advantage of small price changes, making frequent trades to accumulate profits. This strategy is particularly effective in the penny stock market due to the inherent volatility of these low-priced stocks. Technical analysis tools like MACD and RSI can be useful here; for instance, a bullish MACD crossover may signal a good opportunity for a scalp trade.

Momentum trading is another common strategy in penny stocks, where traders aim to capture larger moves in the market. This is often done by using trend following indicators such as moving averages. For example, when a stock's price crosses above its 200-day moving average, it can be a sign that the stock's momentum is turning bullish.

**Swing Trading and Reversal Patterns**

Swing trading is a strategy where traders aim to capture gains in a stock within an overnight hold to several weeks. Technical analysis is essential here, as traders need to identify the start and end of price swings. Tools like Fibonacci retracement levels can help identify potential support and resistance levels during these swings.

Additionally, reversal patterns can be extremely important in penny stock trading. Double tops, double bottoms, head and shoulders – these are all patterns that can signal a reversal of trend. Recognizing these patterns early can help traders take advantage of price movements in the opposite direction.

**Indicators and Volume Analysis**

Technical indicators play a crucial role in trading penny stocks, providing you with insights into market trends, momentum, and potential reversal points. Below are some commonly used indicators and how they can be applied to penny stock trading:

1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It moves between zero and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions. In the context of penny stocks, an RSI above 70 may indicate an overbought condition (and potential sell signal), while an RSI below 30 may suggest an oversold condition (and potential buy signal).
2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator. It shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD triggers technical signals when it crosses above (to buy) or below (to sell) its signal line. The speed of crossovers is also taken as a signal of a market is overbought or oversold.
3. **Bollinger Bands**: Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator. They consist of a middle band (simple moving average) and two outer bands that are 2 standard deviations away from the middle band. When the price is near the upper band, it could be seen as overbought, and when it's near the lower band, it could be seen as oversold. However, a breakout from the bands can signal a continuation of the current trend.

**Volume Analysis**

Volume is another crucial component of technical analysis. Volume refers to the number of shares or contracts traded in a security or market during a given period. High volume often means there's significant interest or activity in the stock, and it can be a sign of the start of a new trend.

In penny stocks, a sudden increase in volume could indicate the start of a significant price movement. This can be particularly useful for breakout strategies – if a penny stock breaks a key resistance level on high volume, it could be a strong buy signal.

Conversely, low volume can signal a lack of interest and could indicate a reversal is near, particularly if the stock is at a key support or resistance level. Traders might use this as a sell signal or an opportunity to short the stock.

**Conclusion**

Trading penny stocks with technical analysis requires a keen understanding of both the market behavior of these volatile securities and the precise application of technical analysis tools. By employing strategies like scalping, momentum trading, swing trading, and accurately identifying reversal patterns, traders can potentially gain a significant edge in the market. However, it's vital to remember that these strategies come with their own risks, and proper risk management should always be a priority.",44,"

Risk management,PennyStocks,Need a penny stock risk management strategy? Top tips.," 

## 3 Top Tips for Creating a Penny Stocks Risk Management Strategy

 Penny stocks offer investors a chance to discover high-potential companies at their infancy stage. Despite being lesser-known, investing in these small-cap stocks can lead to significant profits. Effective risk management is crucial for success in this lesser-known segment of the stock market. 

 Comprehensive research is crucial for informed decisions in penny stock investing. Successful investors scrutinize a company's fundamentals, competitive positioning, and management team's track record to assess growth potential and make informed investment decisions. 

 Diversified investment approach is essential for mitigating risk by spreading investments across multiple industries, rather than focusing on a single company or sector. This approach shields the portfolio from downturns in specific areas, involving multiple sectors and industries. 

 A strict exit strategy helps control potential losses and prevents emotions from steering investment decisions. Developing a systematic selling approach based on time or price movement prevents emotional influences and ensures a smooth exit process. 

Finally, investing only what one can afford to lose serves as a golden rule in penny stock investing. Given the unpredictable nature of these stocks, maintaining a level of investment that does not jeopardize overall financial stability is advisable. 

By adopting these risk management strategies, one can navigate the vibrant landscape of penny stocks, unlocking potentially lucrative opportunities while keeping risk under control.

## 3 Tips for Making a Proper Penny Stocks Risk Management Strategy 

## 1. Understand the Value of Research 

Diving into the world of penny stocks without proper research is akin to navigating unfamiliar waters without a compass. One must understand that comprehensive research is not just beneficial, but essential when considering these low-priced, high-potential investment opportunities. This research becomes the foundation upon which successful investment decisions are made, illuminating the path for those seeking to make substantial gains.

Decoding the business model of the company in which one plans to invest is a fundamental step. Having a grasp of the underlying mechanisms that drive the company’s profits will allow investors to determine if the business has a sustainable model that can weather the various challenges that industries often face. 

Analyzing a company's competitive positioning and unique selling propositions is crucial for future growth potential. The management team's track record and successful ventures can instill confidence in the penny stock's potential. Experienced leadership and successful ventures shape the company's strategic decisions and direction. 

Finally, investors can benefit from reviewing the company’s financials, which are often accessible through public filings. These documents offer valuable insight into the company’s revenues, debts, and overall financial health.

## 2. Utilize a Diverse Investment Approach

In the dynamic world of investing in penny stocks, a diverse investment approach can be the lighthouse that guides you through. By diversifying, investors can spread their risk across a multitude of sectors and industries, increasing the possibility of capitalizing on market trends and counteracting potential downturns.

The importance of sectoral diversification cannot be overstated. An investment strategy that encompasses penny stocks from a variety of sectors allows you to take advantage of the unique growth opportunities each sector offers. For example, you might consider investing in a mix of technology, healthcare, and manufacturing penny stocks. This way, even if one sector experiences a slump, the others could potentially buffer the impact. 

Geographical diversification, another facet of a diverse investment approach, can also provide an added layer of security. By investing in penny stocks from companies operating in different regions or countries, investors can mitigate risks associated with local economic fluctuations.

 When using a diverse investment approach, consider correlation. Non-correlated penny stocks can optimize your portfolio by providing balance if one stock's price dips. Diversification is not a one-size-fits-all strategy; the best approach depends on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Risk-averse investors may prefer a conservative strategy, while risk-tolerant investors may diversify more aggressively. 

## 3. Strictly Adhere to Your Exit Strategy

Venturing into the realm of penny stocks demands not only a comprehensive entry strategy, but also a disciplined exit strategy. This is where the saying “Plan your trade and trade your plan” rings especially true. An exit strategy is a predetermined plan that assists investors in defining when to sell their stocks, and it serves as a crucial tool for managing potential losses and securing profits.

When trading penny stocks, a common exit strategy is setting a price target. This involves determining a specific price at which you plan to sell the stock for a profit, or alternatively, to cut losses. Adhering strictly to this price target prevents emotional decision-making, ensuring you remain rational and disciplined even when the market is turbulent. 

Time-based exit strategies are another valuable tool for penny stock investors. This approach determines in advance how long you intend to hold a position. If the stock doesn’t reach your price target within this period, you exit the position. This can prevent holding onto stocks that are not performing as expected.

 The trailing stop loss is a popular exit strategy that moves with the market, ensuring profits are locked in and losses are limited. This strategy is crucial for penny stocks, as not every investment will yield a profit. Successful investors must adhere strictly to their exit strategy, treating each loss as a learning opportunity.

Risk management,PennyStocks,How do you deal with risk management in red market?,"Hi everyone,

when I buy a stock and already defined my risks upon entry and the next day some bad news happen and market goes red ,

now when I entered the stock I choose the entry price based on risk management whether entry was above support or not,

but because of red day it can break that support that doesn't mean my entry was wrong but the whole market is down therefore this stock goes down with the others,

&#x200B;

so now on the red day do you adjust your risks or stay on the same risk decisions when you entered the stock?

I hope I explained my question very well

I appreciate your views on this matter since its confusing me.",1,"Whenever there’s a day full of red, I just go for a walk in the nearest park, so I can scout for a good spot if I ever became homeless","You might bet a better answer at r/daytrading. However I don't trade right away when the market opens, I usually wait for it to settle down a little bit (3 hours).",

Really simple to use and if you like to play penny stocks on the safer side then this might just be for you. To access it, click ""File"" then ""Make a copy"". You have to be logged into a gmail account to make a copy (I think).

Little explanation of how it works:

* Don't have to put in stock name but it's easier to see what you bought
* Put in the price you bought the stock
* Put in how many shares you bought
* It calculates the total price

* YOU PICK a price you'd like to sell the stock at
* It calculates how many shares you need to sell to cover your costs
* Shows you how many shares will be pure profit shares no matter what happens to the stock price after you've sold at your target price.

You can always put a stop loss or trailing stop loss as your safety net to potentially make more money or you can also use this method if you know you're a FOMO chaser and don't know when to sell haha. Good luck everyone.",102,I did the exact same thing recently. Will definitely use this tho,What if you buy a stock and the price goes down?,Awesome thanks!

Risk management,PennyStocks,"It's a Tough Market, Bros","Just wanted to drop by and give you bros some encouragement.

This market is pretty choppy, and it's difficult to make money consistently during months like March. You can have the best chart pattern, a huge catalyst, and even massive amounts of social media attention on your stock, and it will still come down if the overall market is crashing. 

&#x200B;

Looking at my watchlist of 48 stocks, literally only AMTX and GNUS are green on the day.

# How to Trade in This Market

If you guys are familiar with my trading style, you know i use a lot of strict risk management in my position sizing. And the way the market has been this month, is exactly why i do it. Currently on the month I'm +2.7%, but i have definitely lost more trades than I've won. Its why i use 2:1 risk/reward no matter what. I can lose more trades than I win and still be even.  IF you buy a stock right now, you NEED to have a stop loss and only risk whichever percentage of your account that you're comfortable with, in my opinion. I only risk 2% of my account per trade and cut my losses at that level each time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Basically, I'm not buying any pennystocks right now

I'm watching VISL, ACCO, BHAT, (not too much though), GNUS, and others. But I'm not buying any stocks or pennystocks while I think SPY is bearish. I'm only day trading SPY options, and swing trading SQQQ long position. 

If you buy any pennystocks, I would just tread lightly or plan on day trading for a while. I'm still bearish on SPY down to 350, but maybe April will be bullish again for the market. Til then, just have to trade lightly and not hold any options overnight, while managing my SQQQ swing

&#x200B;

**Just some reminders**

You're a great investor. 

You've been profitable in other months.

You will continue to be profitable once the market is bullish again.

Risk management,PennyStocks,"Morning update for Friday, 02/05/21","Good morning everyone! I want to make a quick clarification and say that this post and list is geared towards day trading, and I am not advocating to blindly buy and hold these at all, in fact I advise strongly against that. Always have a plan when you enter a trade, and use proper risk management.

**Small Cap Watchlist (under $10)**

1. LAIX: Leading gapper but couldn't find a catalyst (momentum from yesterday). Very high volume with decent price action in the premarket. If volume continues strong, I'll be watching the price action closer to the bell. Premarket resistance at 9.58, with possible support at 7.50. 
2. AREC: Gapping up on a news catalyst (company SPAC), with momentum from past few days. Premarket resistance around 6.50, with only support way down at 4.50 (broke through resistance after writing this) (premarket high now at 9.29, yikes). Remember to have proper risk management and have a plan when you enter a trade, don't follow and chase trades blindly.
3. STG: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst (momentum from yesterday). Seeing good volume and price action in the premarket. If it dips below 2.42, then it's showing weakness and there will be better opportunities elsewhere (unless it can get back up to \~2.75 level after the dip), but I'll be keeping an eye on it to see if it can maintain that level.
4. FEDU: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday. Seeing decent volume with pretty good price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance at 2.40, with support around 2.0. Low float so this could see some volatile swings, just have an exit plan when you take a trade, but don't go chasing trades.
5. METX: Gapping up on news catalyst. Seeing good volume and price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance around 4.05, with potential support around 3.25. Relatively low float, so as always, use proper risk management and have a plan for every trade you enter.
6. KRKR: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday. Showing good volume and okay price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance at 7.70, with potential support near 6.17. Price action is a bit choppy in premarket, but I'll still be keeping an eye on this one.
7. JG: Gapping up on a news catalyst. Seeing decent volume, but price action leaves a bit to be desired. I'll want to see a bit stronger price action before I'm watching for an entry point. Premarket resistance around 9.66-9.69, with potential support at 8.20.
8. MKD: Gapping up but couldn't find a catalyst.  Seeing decent volume and price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance at 1.53 with support at 1.40.

*I want to say this, again: if you are a beginner and you made a great trade yesterday, don't go chasing that same feeling today. Stay disciplined, and don't chase trades and money. Maybe take some more time and educate yourself a bit more. A big win or two gives you this newfound confidence, but that can all be stripped away with an even bigger loss, and trust me it doesn't feel good.*

Always remember to have a plan when you enter a trade, and use proper risk management and make sure you size appropriately for your account. Happy trading everyone :)",152,"

First we need to understand the difference between normal distribution and kurtosis.

For the military folks, think ORM or RACI charts - Low Probability, Catastrophic Harm = must be managed.

I've been doing this 13+ years and have experienced a handful of extreme outlier moves. I manage at both the portfolio and trade levels. Maintaining allocation, managing correlation, and having a trading plan are invaluable to actively investing long-term and successfully.

Market trends,PennyStocks,Canadian Securities Exchange CEO on 2024 Market Trends 📈🇨🇦," 

Canadian Securities Exchange CEO Richard Carleton gives us his insights into the Canadian investment landscape. This interview covers topics ranging from opportunities in the mining space to the impact of generative AI.

According to Richard, the key theme governing the markets, particularly in Canada and Australia, is the mining space. He shares that investors can potentially find a “generational wealth opportunity” in mining exploration companies particularly those dealing with critical minerals like zinc, copper, nickel, cobalt, graphite, lithium, and rare earths, driven by the growing demand for these resources in the electric vehicle and battery industries.

Watch this full, interesting video here, interesting that he notes coming deflation and promising gains from A.I. technology:

Market trends,PennyStocks,Penny stocks & the stock market today: Top trends & stocks to watch,"The stock market is a complex ecosystem, influenced by a myriad of factors. From the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) to the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations in Washington, D.C., these influences are shaping daily market trends for penny stocks and higher-priced stocks across the board. In this article, we’ll dive into these dynamics and offer insights into the current state of the stock market. We’ll also get into some of the emerging trends that investors may need to watch this week.  

## The Rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Stock Market Today  

One of the most significant trends shaping the stock market today is the growing interest in AI. This technology, which enables machines to mimic human intelligence, is revolutionizing various sectors, and the stock market is no exception. 

The Nasdaq 100 Index, which comprises the 100 largest tech stocks on the Nasdaq, has seen a significant jump, largely driven by the hype around AI. This surge is contrasted by the Dow Jones Industrial Index’s performance, which has been muted, to say the least. This divergence is indicative of the market stress that often occurs during bear markets and early-stage bull markets when doubts are still prevalent.  

Investors have been piling money into the AI trade, concentrating market gains into a few companies. These include Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia. They account for the majority of the Nasdaq 100’s $4 trillion growth in market valuation this year. Apple and Microsoft alone have each gained more in value than the entire bottom 93 stocks.

## The Impact of AI on Penny Stocks

While AI mania has primarily benefited large-cap tech stocks, it has also created opportunities for investors interested in cheap stocks. Penny stocks, typically defined as stocks trading for less than $5 per share, offer the potential for significant returns, albeit with a higher risk profile. 

Several small-cap software and chip companies have been riding the AI wave, producing outsized returns. These companies, while not as well-known as their larger counterparts, are playing a crucial role in the AI revolution, providing the tools and technologies that enable AI applications.

Investors interested in penny stocks have begun considering companies in the AI space. These companies, while riskier than established tech giants, have offered the potential for significant returns in the short term.

### Tech Penny Stocks To Watch

We discussed several tech and AI penny stocks today as shares of companies like NVIDIA ($NVDA) and C3AI (AI) surged. But those weren’t the only cheap stocks making moves. In fact, several began climbing after the stock market closed on Tuesday:

#### Trust Stamp ($IDAI)

Lately, shares of companies with any sort of exposure to this niche in tech have climbed higher on speculation. Trust Stamp ($IDAI), an identity technology company, is providing AI-powered trust and ID services across a number of sectors. Last week, the company announced a patent allowance by the USPTO titled “Systems and processes for lossy biometric representation,” which expanded Trust Stamps’ current IP portfolio. While no further updates have come out since then, the speculative environment for AI stocks has brought attention to IDAI stock.

#### Near Intelligence ($NIR)

data intelligence company, Near Intelligence ($NIR) saw its share price climb after hours on Tuesday. The penny stock has hovered “near” its 52-week lows for the last week. In its most recent earnings update, Anil Mathews, CEO of Near explained, “I believe that Near is well-positioned to continue to deliver products that our customers rely on to provide insights that help them make better decisions. Looking to the future, we believe our high-quality data, coupled with generative AI, will allow our customers to get the maximum value out of data without sacrificing privacy.”

But what has traders taking a closer look, may have more to do with insider actions than words. This month, Directors Mark Greene and Kathryn Petralia purchased over 50,000 shares, collectively. The average prices of their purchases were in the range of $1.88 to $2.

#### Peraso Inc. ($PRSO)

Semiconductor stocks have also gained interest in the stock market recently and Peraso Inc. ($PRSO) is on that list. The company develops products offering a number of applications, including mmWave 5G and fixed wireless access.

Video streaming, untethered augmented reality, virtual reality, and extended reality are also capable through Peraso’s offerings. The company recently beat earnings estimates for both EPS and sales during the first quarter. Furthermore, attention may have focused on the company’s plans for the year ahead. 

In a Q1 update, CEO Ron Glibbery said, “Our near-term focus remains on expanding Peraso’s leadership in mmWave FWA, as wireless ISPs (WISP) seek to aggressively deploy multi-gigabit connectivity in the unlicensed 60 GHz spectrum to secure share of a rapidly growing subscriber base. In addition, we continue to see encouraging signs of traction on prospective engagements for 5G mmWave applications, with multiple tier-one equipment vendors targeting future FWA deployments worldwide.” 

## The Influence of the Debt Ceiling on the Stock Market

Another significant factor influencing the stock market is the ongoing negotiations in Washington D.C. to raise the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling, which is the maximum amount of debt that the U.S. government can incur, has been a contentious issue in recent years, with disagreements over the ceiling leading to government shutdowns and market volatility. 

The tentative agreement to suspend the debt ceiling until June 2025, if approved by Congress, will allow the U.S. government to pay its bills and avoid a technical default. This development has been seen as removing a potential catastrophic negative from the market, allowing investors to focus on other factors.  

## The Future of the Stock Market

Despite the mixed performance, the market’s future trajectory remains uncertain. Factors such as the Federal Reserve’s next move, the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations, and the continued interest in AI will likely play a significant role in shaping the market’s future.

Investors, particularly those interested in penny stocks, should keep a close eye on these developments. Understanding these influences and trends will be crucial in making informed investment decisions.

Market trends,PennyStocks,"$WPG could make a major move this week- Squeeze factors, Chart factors, Market trend factors, comparables, and more","# Overview - Washington Prime Group

$WPG has a very large short percentage, momentum, positive economic news.  It was trading near all time lows from an exaggerated pandemic push down that is now being lifted as real estate is priced at all time highs and demand is rapidly increasing.  There is a 500% upside gap to fill even without accounting for the fact that the assets should actually be worth MORE than they were at the time the prior prices existed.

\-----------------

# Short Squeeze / Fast Upward Movement Factors

\-**Over 30%** short as of Friday

\-Low, 24 million share float

\-Volume has been **EXTREMELY high** compared to the average, yet shorts have **failed to push it down** (starting with 106 million June 1st, and ending with 19 million on Friday June 5th).

\-The vast **majority of shorts underwater** (The chart is curling now).   Every time shorts tried to push it back down, the **price bounced back**, which makes their situation worse.

\-When a move up doesn't correct back down in the face of volume and shorting, shorts must cover or be **margin called.**

\-With shorts already underwater, any **gap up** or move at open will cause **immediate covering** and stop loss triggers.  Shorts may even have to convert to longs to recoup losses as the price spikes

\-----------------

# Similar Squeezes

\-$IHT, $RHE, $AHT and others have capitalized on the economy finally opening up and shorts getting caught off guard.

\*The short percentage of $IHT and $RHE are comparable to $WPG and look how they moved

\*$IHT and $RHE don't have the huge gaps to fill that $WPG has, but they have gone parabolic on low floats

\*$AHT has a much larger float than $WPG, which limits it's ability to run as $WPG can

\-----------------

# Chart and technical factors

\-The pandemic caused the price to drop in an exaggerated way that left **major gaps** to fill.  In fact, the **gaps to fill** are huge, with the PPS being at **$40** in late 2019 pre-pandemic, and **over** **$30** in early 2020.

\*The past stock prices don't even account for the increase in real estate value overall that we've seen, with supply being at lows and demand being very high.  $WPG has prime real estate in it's REIT.

\-When it breaks resistance it can sprint up dollars at a time.  For example, breaking $6 in the past has led to **a move above $12** very quickly

\-The initial 100 million share move only barely went down and **curled back up** into Friday

\-Bullish **after hours** trading occurred Friday, indicating the sentiment for the coming week. There should have been profit taking on a Friday that causes a dip, but it **didn't happen**.  Strength seems to be growing.

\-**Volume** has remained strong through the week, with shorting having no successful effect on the price

\-Resistance levels are **rising**

\-The MacD, RSI, and other technical measure **cooled off as needed,** while **maintaining a strong price** and curling up against short pressure.  Non-overextended technicals are an important factor to allow the **next leg up** next week to go 100% plus and still have room.

&#x200B;

\-----------------

# Quality of $WPG

\-Blackrock, Vanguard, Charles Swab, and other MAJOR players are invested in this.  WPG is NOT some speculative, trash stock without real intrinsic value or interest

\-They have property in major metropolitan areas across the entire US with quality tenants including Home Goods, Aurora, Macy's, and more.  They are adapting to new consumer trends and earning new forms of income for entertainment experiences to replace any shopping facilities that became vacant.  \*The value of location cannot be replaced and tenants are paying for that.

\-----------------

# Industry momentum

\-Retail real estate is filling vacancies quickly, even redeveloping for a new generation of shoppers with new types of entertainment, sports, and dining experiences - for example -[https://investor.washingtonprime.com/investor-relations/news-and-views/news/news-details/2021/FieldhouseUSA-Opens-at-Polaris-Fashion-Place-Bringing-a-Major-Sports-Entertainment-Complex-to-Central-Ohio/default.aspx](https://investor.washingtonprime.com/investor-relations/news-and-views/news/news-details/2021/FieldhouseUSA-Opens-at-Polaris-Fashion-Place-Bringing-a-Major-Sports-Entertainment-Complex-to-Central-Ohio/default.aspx)

\-Real estate prices are at all time highs if you haven't noticed, and that gives owners like WPG leverage to sell or re-purpose parcels (read: parking lots that can become parking garages)

\-Mall retailers are having record sales, which can mean higher and more reliable rent -

Market trends,PennyStocks,NASDAQ: $TNXP - Tonix Pharmaceuticals A COVID pennystock with an actual pipeline and potential for 10-15$/ or 500%-1000% gains. AND with Institutions loading up DD," 

I've seen a lot of post talking about $Tnxp lately and some people I've seen have wanted initial DD so here it goes.

[https://www.tonixpharma.com](https://www.tonixpharma.com/) Taken directly from their website:

**Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp (NASDAQ: TNXP) (Tonix) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering and developing innovative and proprietary new therapeutics that address the needs of patients. We focus on developing small molecules and biologics to treat CNS (pain, neurology, psychiatry, addiction) and immunological (vaccines, immunosuppression, oncology, autoimmune disease) conditions.**

**THEIR PIPELINE OF DRUGS:**

**TNX 102:** A Fibromyalgia drug in phase 3 trials that already had positive results in it's first part of it's phase three trials. Yes Fibromyalgia and the stock is still under 2$ with a market cap of under a billion. Now how much is Fibromyalgia worth ? See for yourself. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/05/10/1821834/0/en/Fibromyalgia-Treatment-Market-to-Surpass-US-3-607-3-Million-by-2026-Coherent-Market-Insights.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/05/10/1821834/0/en/Fibromyalgia-Treatment-Market-to-Surpass-US-3-607-3-Million-by-2026-Coherent-Market-Insights.html)

**For those too lazy to click the link it's estimated to be worth 2.8 billion.** **Oh yeah and there's less than three drugs specifically used to treat fibromyalgia approved on the open market by the FDA.**

**TNX 1500:** Used For the prevention AND treatment of organ rejection. Also, they are working with Mass General Hospital on this.

**TNX 102 SL FOR ALZHEIMERS:**

[**https://www.tonixpharma.com/therapeutic-areas/aad**](https://www.tonixpharma.com/therapeutic-areas/aad)

Remember TNX 102 from earlier? The improved sleep quality seen in earlier clinical trials of TNX-102 SL for other disorders suggests TNX-102 SL could potentially be an effective treatment for agitation in Alzheimer's disease. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for AAD, despite a high disease burden and a need for an effective therapy. **TNX-102 SL for the treatment of AAD has been designated by the FDA a Fast Track development program**, designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. **YES FDA FASTTRACK.

**Before this they had around 40 million banked looking at the last quarter add the new two funding/offerings that means they 150 MILLION IN CASH.**

**After these offerings the share float will be a little over 300 million. Assuming the institutions didn't flip for pennies this means they own essentially a little under 33% of the stock.**

**EDIT: I almost forgot in 5 or 6 days it will regain Nasdaq Compliance as well.**

I got in last year for 4300 shares @ 1.01. Unfortunately I don't have the funds to buy more. I hope this answered your questions ladies and gentleman about TNXP$. Get in while it's still low and happy trading and good luck out there. Let's all make some money.",3745,"

Market trends,PennyStocks,When to sell penny stocks to get the biggest return,"Trading penny stocks can provide prospects for big earnings due to their low cost and potential for high returns. When selling these stocks, focus on timing, market movements, and the stock's intrinsic worth to maximize gains. Timing is critical, as selling at the correct time is critical to profitability. Because penny stocks generally react swiftly to market emotion, market movements might provide insights into when to sell. Understanding these trends can assist in determining the best-selling window.

**Pay Close Attention to the Timing:** When selling penny stocks for maximum profit, timing is critical. It's often more important than the initial purchase. Selling at the right moment, after the stock gains attention but before the market gets saturated with sell orders, is key. Penny stocks often surge due to catalysts like news or product launches, providing profit opportunities. Monitoring industry-related events and fiscal reporting periods can help you time your sales advantageously. Engaging with the company's narrative is vital, as a compelling story can boost a penny stock's value. Selling when the narrative peaks ensures the best profit before the buzz fades.

**Consider Market Trends:** Understanding market trends is crucial for maximizing profits when selling penny stocks. These stocks often follow broader market movements and sector-specific trends. Investors who track these trends can sell at opportune times. In bullish markets, there's a greater appetite for risk, making penny stocks attractive for higher returns. Selling during these phases can be profitable. In downtrends, look for signs of a turnaround or resilient sectors for optimal timing. Minor sentiment shifts can have a significant impact on penny stocks, so monitoring macroeconomic indicators is also important.

**Use Strategic Selling:** Strategic selling is vital for maximizing profits when trading penny stocks. This approach involves setting clear objectives, including target sell prices and time frames, based on meticulous research and analysis. Using a tiered selling strategy, where you sell in increments as the stock price rises, and employing stop-loss orders for risk management can be highly effective. Additionally, investors should consider tax implications to optimize after-tax gains. Strategic selling combines data-driven analysis with disciplined execution for precise and confident penny stock trading.",8,"

Economic indicators,PennyStocks,Maximize your earnings with penny stocks: Essential tips for income seekers," 

## Understand the Company Behind the Stock 

 A vital strategy when trading penny stocks is gaining a comprehensive understanding of the company behind the stock. This is not merely about perusing financial reports, but delving deeper into the nuances of the company’s operations, its strategic direction, and its position within the industry. This information is instrumental in making informed decisions and optimizing the potential for income generation.

When assessing a company’s financial health, an investor should look at the firm’s earnings and revenue growth. Positive trends in these areas indicate a company’s ability to generate profits, a key factor for successful penny stock trading. Furthermore, it is essential to investigate the company’s debt levels. A company with manageable debt is generally in a better position to navigate economic fluctuations and maintain growth.

  The company’s industry standing and the overall market trends should also be considered. It is beneficial to invest in companies that operate within growing industries as they are likely to have better prospects for the future. Understanding the company’s competitive position within its industry can provide insights into its potential for growth and profitability.

#  Diversify Your Portfolio 

 Diversification is a cornerstone strategy for any type of investment, and it holds just as true for penny stocks. It involves spreading investments across a range of different stocks to balance the potential rewards. By investing in a variety of penny stocks across different sectors, investors can create a more robust and balanced portfolio.

The primary purpose of diversification is risk management. While all investments come with some level of risk, having a diverse portfolio can mitigate potential losses. If one stock underperforms, the successful performance of other stocks in the portfolio can compensate for it, helping to maintain overall portfolio health.

  Diversification also enables investors to tap into different sectors and industries. Each industry has unique characteristics and is influenced by different economic factors. By spreading investments across multiple sectors, such as technology, healthcare, or energy, investors can take advantage of growth in various areas of the market. 

#  Understand and Leverage Trading Indicators 

 In the realm of penny stock trading, understanding and leveraging trading indicators is a strategy that can provide valuable insights and improve decision-making. Trading indicators are statistical measures of market conditions and trends that traders use to predict future price movements. These tools can help traders identify opportunities for profitable trades and mitigate potential risks.

Among the numerous trading indicators available, moving averages are one of the most commonly used. A moving average is an indicator that calculates the average price of a stock over a specific period, smoothing out short-term fluctuations and highlighting longer-term trends. It can help traders identify potential buy and sell signals, making it a valuable tool for strategic decision-making.

 Another widely used trading indicator is the relative strength index (RSI). This tool measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions. If the RSI indicates that a stock is overbought, it may be due for a price correction, while an oversold condition could signal an upcoming price increase.",10,"

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.)","A useful barometer for how much of a chance something has for diluting/ offering new shares is gonna be EPS and management history practices. “Earning vs burning” 

positive EPS shows a company that is profitable and able to run with minimal risk or need to raise money by offering and selling new shares. An example of this would be $sach, positive earnings, low risk of dilution etc. they even pay out quarterly dividends and have OK cashflow from catering to fix-n-flip and loan sharking, also is an REIT

a money burner example is $muln, eps of negative 39 dollars per share, showing extreme risk of further dilution and RS etc etc. with millions of shares, that means they are bleeding money very very very fast

Now some people believe that you need to learn harmonic patterns and candle patterns and all this other shit. It's beneficial for you to learn it, I will agree on that, however we are in the age of the world where technology can do all that basic shit for you.

Here's an example of an ""Indicator"" showing me simple Bear/Bull ABCD patterns.

[https://imgur.com/cen5qjR](https://imgur.com/cen5qjR)

Need to know the support and resistances of a stock ? Guess what, a simple indicator can easily do that for you.

[https://imgur.com/u15elOK](https://imgur.com/u15elOK)

You can literally find or create an indicator for any of your needs. You'll hear people that say ""All you need is Rsi and MACD"" ... Those people have never looked at any other indicators imo, considering there are ones that have been made that are way more accurate than both.

&#x200B;

Now what if you don't have TOS and only want to use Webull ? Well, thankfully Webull has a few indicators built in that you can use that will help you.

Although I hate regular MACD, you can still use it to ""hopefully"" avoid being cucked in a trade.

[https://imgur.com/eyQ7f7I](https://imgur.com/eyQ7f7I)

I'm sure with the above picture, you can see how you could get cucked. Get in at the wrong time and could end bad, get out at the wrong time and it could be even worse. MACD is a ""lagging"" indicator, which is why people pair it with RSI (leading indicator)

[https://imgur.com/eh84vQA](https://imgur.com/eh84vQA)

You can see the benefit and drawback of it from the above picture.

&#x200B;

Now imagine using something like this indicator that most people overlook.

[https://imgur.com/yxbop2i](https://imgur.com/yxbop2i)

If you were Playing Contracts/Options, You could have easily bought a 200C for this upcoming week for under $100 and sold it for over $1,000.

My recommendation for anyone who is actually reading this shit, learn to use indicators. Every indicator has a set of rules that can differ for the time frame that it's set on. This shit can save you a lot of time and money. RSI and MACD are literally the most basic ones, don't be a fool and blindly follow only those indicators when there could be others that are much more suited to your needs.

Edit2: Changed the last sentence , brought to my attention how confusing it was. Also, you can customize the MACD to act differently depending on the ""periods/days""

Edit3: Here's one of the websites I used to find a few of the indicators that I use. There is another that I'm trying to recall, will update in the morning with it.

Economic indicators,PennyStocks,"AI analysis of RNAZ, $AVTX, NVOS, FWBI, and GMBL","**The following is AI generated and should be used as a jumping off point for your own analysis. This is still in very active development. Remember that day trading is risky. You're responsible for any trades you choose to make.**

Also, here was the performance in August if it helps: https://smcn.io/blog/august-performance-2023. It has improved since then but it goes to show that it isn't ""set and forget"" right now. Please be careful.

**$RNAZ**

TransCode Therapeutics, Inc. (RNAZ) has been experiencing a downward trend recently, with the 10-day SMA at $1.23 and the 20-day SMA at $1.45, both higher than the current price of $1.08. The RSI values are significantly below 30, indicating an oversold condition which could potentially lead to a price rebound. However, the MACD histograms are negative, suggesting a bearish momentum. The stock's trading volume today is quite high at 2.71M, which could indicate increased interest from traders. The most recent 15-minute candle closed at $1.08, which is the same as the current price. This suggests that the price could be stabilizing after a period of decline. Given these factors, I predict an entry price of $1.10 with 90% confidence. If the price rebounds as expected, the first price target would be $1.20 with 85% confidence, and the second price target would be $1.30 with 80% confidence. These predictions are based on the current market conditions and the stock's recent performance.

**$AVTX**

Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. (AVTX) has been on a bullish run recently, with its stock price surging by 68% to $0.2075. This surge is largely due to the company's decision to divest certain pipeline drugs to AUG Therapeutics, which has significantly boosted market sentiment. However, the company's long-term performance may be influenced by its ability to maintain its listing status on Nasdaq. The momentum data for AVTX is positive, indicating that the stock is trending upwards in online discussions. The current volume of 45.71M also suggests strong trading activity. The SPY and QQQ overviews suggest a cautiously positive outlook for today, but with potential volatility. Looking at the technical analysis, the 10-day SMA and 20-day SMA are both at $0.11, while the 50-day SMA is at $0.19. The 8-day EMA is at $0.13 and the 20-day EMA is at $0.14. The RSI values are high, suggesting that the stock is currently overbought. Given these factors, I predict an entry price of $0.30 with 90% confidence. My first price target is $0.35 with 85% confidence, and my second price target is $0.40 with 80% confidence. These predictions are based on the current bullish momentum and positive market sentiment towards AVTX. However, traders should be aware of the potential risks due to market volatility and the company's listing status on Nasdaq.

**$NVOS**

The recent momentum data for Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. (NVOS) shows a positive trend, with the latest figure at 15.46, indicating a strong online discussion trend. The stock's current price is $0.4847, which has seen a significant rise recently, jumping 12.1% to $0.4104 after a previous increase of over 36%. This could indicate positive investor sentiment and potential growth for the company. The broader market sentiment, as gauged by SPY and QQQ overviews, seems cautiously positive but with potential volatility. The current volume of NVOS is 5.34M, which is quite high, suggesting a lot of trading activity. The 10-day SMA is at $0.28, above the 20-day SMA of $0.23, indicating a bullish trend. However, the RSI values are quite high, suggesting the stock might be overbought. Given these factors, I predict an entry price of $0.49 with 92% confidence. The first price target would be $0.51, with a confidence level of 90%, and the second price target would be $0.53, with a confidence level of 91%. These predictions are based on the current economic climate, recent news, and technical analysis of the stock.

**$FWBI**

First Wave BioPharma (FWBI) is on the cusp of a significant breakthrough. The company's recent acquisition of an exclusive global license for Capeserod from Sanofi, coupled with its innovative use of AI in drug development, has the potential to significantly boost its stock price. The market sentiment for both SPY and QQQ is cautiously positive, indicating a favourable environment for FWBI. The stock has shown a strong upward trend in today's trades, with the closing price consistently higher than the opening price. The volume of trades is also high, indicating strong investor interest. The 10-day SMA and 20-day SMA are both below the current price, suggesting a bullish trend. The RSI values are above 50, indicating that the stock is currently being overbought, which could lead to a price correction in the future. Given these factors, I predict an entry price of $0.94 with a confidence level of 95%. My first price target is $1.00 with a confidence level of 90%, and my second price target is $1.10 with a confidence level of 85%. These predictions are based on the current momentum and market sentiment, and they factor in the potential impact of the recent news on the stock price.

**$GMBL**

Esports Entertainment Group Inc. (GMBL) has been showing a mixed performance recently, with the momentum data indicating a slight downward trend. The stock's current price is $0.1548, and it has a market cap of $5.50M. The SPY and QQQ overviews suggest a cautiously positive outlook for today, but with potential volatility. Looking at the 15-minute candles, GMBL has shown some volatility with prices ranging from $0.13 to $0.195. The volume has been relatively high, indicating strong trading activity. The stock's 10-day SMA is $0.12, and the 20-day SMA is $0.14, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. However, the RSI values are around 50, indicating a neutral market condition. Given these factors, I predict an entry price of $0.16 with a confidence level of 92%. My first price target is $0.18 with a confidence level of 90%, and my second price target is $0.20 with a confidence level of 91%. These predictions are based on the current economic climate and the stock's recent performance. Please note that these predictions are subject to change based on market conditions.",3,"

Economic indicators,PennyStocks,Benchmark Increases Overall Gold Ounces by 44% and 77% in the Measured & Indicated Classification with Expanded Mineral Resource Estimate Further Derisking the Gold-Silver Project,"BNCHF  just announced a significant increase to its global bulk-tonnage Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) for its flagship Lawyers Gold-Silver Project.

The MRE comprised of 1,097 drill holes totaling 200,000 metres collectively from the Cliff Creek, AGB and Dukes Ridge deposits were used for Mineral Resource Estimation. The 100% owned Lawyers Gold-Silver Project is located within a road accessible region of the prolific Golden Horseshoe area of north-central British Columbia, Canada.

&#x200B;

John Williamson, CEO, commented, ""The expanded Mineral Resource Estimate is demonstrating the world-class potential of Benchmark's multi-million-ounce gold-silver deposits. The Company has provided one of the highest-grade, open pitable mining projects in North America. The 2021 drill program and winter 2022 drill program has significantly de-risked the project with approximately 90 percent of the Mineral Resource within the Measured + Indicated classification. With the deposits open, further resource growth is possible and the Project has numerous targets that may develop into near mine satellite deposits. The company has drilled-out a significant amount of gold and silver ounces that is not included in the $1700 pit shell. At higher precious metals prices, the contained gold increases significantly. The MRE comprises of proven economically minable material while the remaining, outside of pit gold and silver will provide a significant opportunity as the price of precious metals increases.""

&#x200B;

Ian Harris, VP Engineering, commented, ""The Project is demonstrating potential for economic mining methods with high-grade mineralization extending from surface to depth. The higher-grade core zones at surface will have a positive impact on economics in the forthcoming Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). Benchmark's drill-to-build philosophy is delivering the results to develop the Project into a world-class gold-silver mine located in one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world.""

Benchmark Metals invites you to a webinar to discuss the Mineral Resource Estimate on Tuesday, June 14th at 8 am PST, 11 am EST, and 6 pm CET:

* The Mineral Resource shows excellent continuity and consistency, demonstrated by increasing AuEq cut-off grades having marginal impact on the pit-constrained AuEq ounces.

High Grade Zones - Indicative Starter Pits with higher-grade;

* Cliff Creek and Dukes Ridge deposits show 5.2 million tonnes at 1.74 g/t AuEq for approximately 292,000 oz AuEq at a preliminary strip ratio of 2.2:1
* AGB deposit 7.5 million tonnes at 1.74 g/t AuEq for approximately 418,000 oz AuEq at a preliminary strip ratio of 1.7:1
* Strip ratios - Overall OP preliminary strip ratio for the full MRE is 5.6:1 for CC-DR and 2.9:1 for AGB;
* The MRE will form the basis of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) to be completed in Q3, 2022;
* All of the zones remain open for further expansion, and;
* The Project holds multiple satellite targets for discoveries and additional gold-silver mineralization.

Economic indicators,PennyStocks,U.S. Goldmining INC $USGO,"In my opinion, the economic conditions are optimal for gold as it currently trades above $2,000/oz., and with the Federal Reserve projected to hike interest rates for the final time in this cycle.

A new IPO recently began trading, having raised $20M from institutional investors at $10/share, but its current price is at a 10% discount, trading at $9.15/share, with $19M in cash on hand.

US GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO), a company that spun out from one I am familiar with, has a CEO, Tim Smith, who has over 25 years of experience in mineral exploration and mining. He is focused on developing their Whistler copper-gold project with favorable mining conditions.

USGO has a market cap of $108M, with an enterprise value of $90M after deducting its cash. The company's project has 3M equivalent ounces of indicated resource of gold and 6.4M equivalent ounces of inferred gold, with a total of 9.4M equivalent ounces of gold across all categories. This results in a valuation of less than $10/ounce, compared to recent buyouts in the region that occurred at over $100/ounce.

This is still in very active development. Remember that day trading is risky. You're responsible for any trades you choose to make.**

**$AVTX**

Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. (AVTX) has been on a bullish run recently, with the stock price surging by 39% to $0.1184 and then gaining another 52.6% to $0.1295. This upward trend is largely due to the company's decision to divest its AVTX-800 series, which has been positively received by the market. The momentum data for the stock also indicates a positive trend, with values of 7.24 and 9.17. The broader market sentiment, as indicated by the SPY and QQQ overviews, is mixed but leans slightly towards the negative due to concerns over inflation data and the performance of tech giants. However, this may not significantly impact AVTX as it operates in a different sector. Looking at the technical analysis, the stock's current price of $0.227 is well above its 10-day SMA of $0.10 and 20-day SMA of $0.11, indicating a strong upward momentum. The RSI values are also relatively high, suggesting that the stock is currently being heavily bought. Given these factors, I predict that AVTX will continue its upward trend today. I am 90% confident that the entry price will be around $0.23 within the next 30 minutes. My first price target is $0.25, which I am 90% confident will be reached. If the bullish momentum continues, my second price target is $0.27, which I am 80% confident will be reached.

**$SLE**

Super League Enterprise, Inc. (SLE) is showing a strong upward momentum, with the stock price closing at $2.65 yesterday. The stock has been on a steady rise, with a significant increase in trading volume, indicating a high level of interest among traders. The momentum data for SLE is positive, suggesting that the stock is trending well in online discussions. The broader market sentiment, as indicated by SPY and QQQ overviews, is mixed with a slight lean towards negative due to market anxiety and recent underperformance. However, this may not significantly impact SLE as it seems to be following its own trajectory. Looking at the 15-minute candles, there's a clear upward trend with the last candle closing at $2.6599998. This suggests a strong buying pressure. Given the current momentum and trading patterns, I predict an entry price of $2.70 with a confidence level of 95%. My first price target would be $2.80 (confidence: 90%) and the second price target at $2.90 (confidence: 90%). Please note that these predictions are based on the current data and market conditions. Any significant change in the market sentiment or any news related to the company could impact the stock's performance.

**$CSSE**

Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc. (CSSE) is showing a promising upward trend today. The stock opened at $0.3726 and has been steadily climbing, reaching a high of $0.558. The recent news about Crackle Connex's new advertising capabilities and Redbox's upcoming app launch on Fire TV could be driving this positive momentum. Despite bearish sentiments in the broader market, as indicated by SPY and QQQ overviews, CSSE seems to be bucking the trend. I predict an entry price of $0.45 with a first price target of $0.50 and a second price target of $0.55. I am 90% confident in these predictions.

**$ZVSA**

ZyVersa Therapeutics, Inc. (ZVSA) is in the spotlight today with a recent publication in Frontiers in Immunology and a Buy Rating from HC Wainwright. The stock's current price is $0.1509, with a market cap of 3.97M. The trading volume is at 3.61M, indicating a high level of interest in the stock. The stock has been showing a bullish trend with its 10-day SMA at $0.13 and 20-day SMA at $0.14. The RSI values are around 40, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Given the positive news and technical indicators, I predict an entry price of $0.155 with a first price target of $0.165 and a second price target of $0.175. I am 90% confident in these price targets. However, the broader market sentiment as indicated by SPY and QQQ overviews is mixed, so traders should proceed with caution.

**$WKHS**

Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) is currently trading at $0.7809, with a market cap of $135.14M. The company has recently received IRS approval as a qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit manufacturer, which could potentially increase sales and revenue. This news, coupled with the company's progress in manufacturing capabilities, has led to increased investor interest. The stock's momentum data shows a positive trend, with values of 2.23 and 2.51. The SPY and QQQ overviews indicate a mixed market sentiment, with potential volatility due to inflation data and concerns over tech giants. Looking at the technical analysis, the stock's 10-day SMA is at $0.70, while the 20-day SMA is at $0.74, indicating a bullish trend. The RSI values are around 33, suggesting that the stock is currently oversold. Given these factors, I predict an entry price of $0.79, with a first price target of $0.81 and a second price target of $0.83. I am 90% confident in these price targets. However, due to the current economic climate and potential market volatility, I recommend caution when trading this stock.

**$CELZ**

The stock of Creative Medical Technology Holdings, Inc. (CELZ) has been on a bullish run recently, with the current price at $7.25, significantly above its 10-day SMA of $4.88 and 20-day SMA of $4.71. The RSI values are also high, indicating strong buying pressure. The momentum in online discussions is positive, suggesting that investor sentiment is bullish. Looking at today's trading data, CELZ started at $6.42 and reached a high of $8.00, showing a strong upward trend. The volume of trades is also increasing, which further supports the bullish sentiment. Given these factors, I predict an entry price of $7.30 with 95% confidence. My first price target is $7.85 with 90% confidence, and my second price target is $8.40 with 85% confidence. These predictions are based on the current bullish momentum and the absence of any negative news that could impact the stock's performance. In summary, CELZ is showing strong bullish signals, and I recommend entering a long position at $7.30, with price targets of $7.85 and $8.40.",11,"

Economic indicators,PennyStocks,"""What Does Alaska Energy Metals’ Nickel Find Mean for the Mining Industry?"" - AEMC.v AKEMF Intersects 317.2 m Grading 0.34% Nickel Equivalent","**Furthering its ground-breaking discovery at the Nikolai Nickel Project in Alaska, Alaska Energy Metals (AEMC.v AKEMF) has intersected 317.2 m grading 0.34% nickel equivalent, confirming mineralization along 860m of strike length!**

Drilled as part of AEMCs exploration program at its 100% owned Nikolai Nickel Project, assays for 6 holes have been received with two holes pending.

https://preview.redd.it/yg2bzy1xaj4c1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=88c1af638a2adbe6eb1093f0c7f8589cb7d6e655

**Demonstrating the Eureka Zone remains consistent and homogenous, as indicated by historical drilling on the property, these results have confirmed mineralization continuity along an 860m strike length on the zone with mineralization remaining open in all directions.**

Alaska Energy Metals President & CEO Gregory Beischer commented: 

>“These two holes further increase the drilled strike extent of the Eureka Zone to 860m. With results from the remaining two drill holes anticipated soon, we can begin calculating an updated Inferred Resource and complete metallurgical studies. Drilling results are consistent with historical drill holes, which intermittently trace out a strike extent of more than 10 kilometers for the mineralized zone. The nickel–copper sulfide mineralization is remarkably homogeneous.”

AEMC's Nikolai Nickel Project boasts a resource exceeding 1.5B pounds of nickel, 372M pounds of copper, 115M pounds of cobalt as detailed in the Maiden NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate and is ""quickly evolving into one of the largest nickel resources on the continent"".

On track to hit a resource growth target of reaching multiple billions of pounds of in situ 0.35% NiEq within 18 months, AEMC is advancing the project with an aggressive, multi-drill approach, including up to 4 drill rigs moving next season.

**As detailed in the Economist Global in an article titled ""What Does Alaska Energy Metals’ Nickel Find Mean for the Mining Industry?"", ""this significant find not only highlights the potential of the Nikolai Nickel Project but also underlines the importance of Alaska as a key player in the global mining landscape."":** [**https://www.economistglobal.com/what-does-alaska-energy-metals-nickel-find-mean-for-the-mining-industry/**](https://www.economistglobal.com/what-does-alaska-energy-metals-nickel-find-mean-for-the-mining-industry/) 

Further, the 0.34% NiEq is a compelling indicator of the areas profitability and viability for mining operations. The Eureka Zone is now known for its extensive mineralization, providing a testament to the geological richness of the Nikolai Nickel Project.

""Symbolizing a potential paradigm shift in the nickel mining industry,"" the Nikolai Nickel Project is poised to become a significant contributor to the economy and, as a domestic source of critical minerals, it reduced reliance on foreign imports, strengthening national economic security.

Economic indicators,PennyStocks,"OMID's Stock Performance: A Day of Decline and Stability - July 24, 2023","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zyj541svl4eb1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=1555331b05fa7ed07fa3a48828b1382232929ff1

https://preview.redd.it/2qss3xtlm4eb1.png?width=3236&format=png&auto=webp&s=92cc84fb5397017389a4a7adfe99de29d4b4ada8

On July 24, 2023, OMID's stock opened the trading day at 0.0950, mirroring the closing price of the previous session. The stock reached its daily high at the opening price, but retreated to a low of 0.0711 before settling at a closing price of 0.0831. This day was marked by a lower trading volume of 43,609 shares, of which 28,100 were short volume.

## A Subdued Day on the Market

July 24 saw OMID's stock opening at 0.0950, immediately hitting its daily high before a downward movement led the stock to a low of 0.0711. This decline might have been driven by various factors, ranging from market sentiment to broader economic indicators or company-specific news. Regardless of the cause, it’s important to note that such market fluctuations are a routine part of investing in equities.

## Moderate Trading Activity

One notable aspect of the day's trading was the relatively moderate trading volume of 43,609 shares, a significant reduction from the previous session. This decrease suggests a lower level of investor activity and could potentially indicate a wait-and-see attitude among traders, who might be observing the market dynamics before deciding their next moves.

## Short Volume and Its Implications

Another element worth highlighting is the short volume of 28,100 shares. The presence of short selling, where investors bet on a stock's price decline, could signal anticipation of a downward price movement among some traders. However, it’s crucial to remember that short selling is just one facet of market activity and doesn’t always foretell a definitive trend.

## Closing Price and Moving Forward

Despite the decline witnessed during the trading session, OMID’s  stock managed to recover part of its losses, closing at 0.0831. This  recovery from the day’s low may suggest that while some investors were  selling, others saw potential value at the lower price and stepped in to  purchase the stock.

### Conclusion: Calm Amid the Decline

The trading session on July 24, 2023, served as a reminder that the  stock market isn’t always about swift price movements or high volumes.  Some days, like this one for OMID, present a picture of calm and  stability, even amid a price decline.

These seemingly less eventful days are as vital to the overall market  narrative as those marked by extreme volatility or high trading  activity. They serve to balance the stock market’s rhythm and offer  insights that can be useful in shaping investment strategies.

The response I received was amazing and I have been working on improving the program. This is the second stock picked by the program. If you had seen the first post, please feel free to skip to the DD.

**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How does it work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Core Product**

MindMed is in the field of developing psychedelic-based medications and treatments for neurological and mental health disorders. The company is in a very early stage (founded in 2019) but is backed by famous investors such as Bruce Linton (Founder, Canopy Growth) and Kevin O’Leary (Shark Tank).

They have 3 main products in the pipeline

i. **18-MC:** The optimism around MindMed is primarily due to the 18-MC drug which shows promising results in treating alcohol, drug, and nicotine addiction. 18-MC is currently in phase 2 of clinical trials for opioid addiction.

ii. **Project Lucy:** This is a commercial drug based on micro-dosing LSD by a therapist to treat anxiety disorders and adult ADHD. Currently on phase 2 clinical trial.

iii. **Digital Therapeutics:** MindMed is betting on digital therapeutics as the future for their drug delivery by creating a platform aimed at delivering psychedelic based treatments and therapies in combination with digital therapeutics

&#x200B;

[Product pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/036ihnlukmj61.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=24d713d7be28d1864cca57d9ff9e4cd09c8f605a)

**Financials**

The company has raised approximately $185M since its inception (six rounds). Mindmed raised $72M in Jan’21 increasing their cash in hand to a healthy $144M. The company is planning to use the proceeds from the latest fundraising to Project Lucy and 18-MC.

There isn’t much sense in talking about revenue and P&L as this is a very early-stage biotech company that by nature cannot generate any significant revenue until their drugs get approval. But the company had a sustainable burn rate and had a net loss of $8.6M in the quarter ending Sep’20.

**Potential and Hype Factor**

The buzz is generated primarily due to the following reasons

Nasdaq up-listing is one of the major catalysts in the increasing discussion. The company is currently listed in NEO and have applied to be listed in Nasdaq which will significantly add to the liquidity (Expected in Q1-21)

Adding to this, MindMed has multiple products in its pipeline. The company currently has 3 major products which are in phase 2 of clinical trial which significantly de-risk the company’s future as you are not betting on one single product getting FDA approval

Inline with the digital therapeutics aim of the company, MindMed acquired HealthMode, a digital therapeutics startup that uses AI and ML to increase the precision and speed of clinical research and patient monitoring (all-stock deal)

**Risk and Competition**

There is definitely a significant risk associated with investing in small-cap stocks. The main risk factors for MindMed that I could see are

a. Drug Approval: This is the simplest and would have the most impact on the company’s future. If none of the drugs in the company’s pipeline get approval from FDA, the company would go under.

b. Ability to raise funds: Since MindMed is an early-stage biotech startup, the company would make no revenue for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, the ability of the company in raising funds outpacing its burn rate is critical

c. Acceptance for psychedelic drugs: Although growing, currently the acceptance for psychedelic drug is very low. MindMed has an uphill battle in convincing the masses about the efficacy of its drugs

**Conclusion**

There is currently a $100B+ global total addressable market for psychedelics. Even though there are significant risks in-terms of psychedelic drug acceptance and FDA drug approval, MindMed currently offers the broadest and most diversified pipeline of psychedelic drugs in clinical development. This along with their ability to raise funds puts them in a very strong position.

stock,PennyStocks,$CTRM DD Huge Value Stock,"# About $CTRM

**Castor Maritime Inc. (CTRM) is a global shipping company specializing in the ownership of dry-bulk vessels.**

It was first admitted to the NASDAQ in the month of February 2019 at a share price of USD7.10. It has grew steadily reaching a high of $19.00 at a point.

It invested heavily in the emerging seaborne shipping markets early in 2020. However, due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, it fell to an all-time low of $0.11.

This is also partly due to the COVID-19 restrictions set on the seaborne shipping industry which accounts for almost 80% of CTRM’s trading volume.

# Why you should invest in $CTRM

With the new vaccine rollouts, COVID-19’s end is in sight and the seaborne shipping industry is well positioned for a comeback.

CTRM recently acquired new dry-bulk vessels and is **aggressively expanding** and by improving their fleet and increasing their market share.

CTRM’s share price has been steadily increasing. The high Beta ratio of 1.54 can be highly attributed to the sharp decline in price due to the reasons mentioned before.

President Biden has signaled his willingness to address climate change and the dry-bulk vessels that CTRM is using have a lower carbon footprint. This means that while other shipping companies are consolidating, CTRM can continue its aggressive expansion.

# Financial Statement Analysis

**CTRM’s financial statements are pulled from Yahoo Finances.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dq3i98x2ukf61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33673aee228afe04a89720f3472bd75bb2078d9d

CTRM’s gross profit can be seen to be steadily **increasing** over the years. This is due to the constant increase in the revenue to the company.

CTRM’s pretax income has been **increasing** from 2017 to 2019. However, it is having a loss this year. This is partly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and its acquisition of the new dry-bulk shipping vessels.

CTRM’s net interest income has drastically **increased** from 2019. This means that they have paid back a lot of their debts and is deleveraged. This reduced the risk of the company as a whole and the shares of CTRM.

From the Financial Statement as a whole, we can see the effects of CTRM’s aggressive expansion with the increased expenses overall and the rewards of it with its increased profits.

# Conclusion

The seaborne shipping industry is poised to make a great comeback at the end of COVID-19 and CTRM is at the head of it. In the industry itself, CTRM also has an advantage over other companies due to its low carbon footprint vessels. With a current share price of $0.65 to $0.70 it is a **good buy** and I predict that it will hit at least **$1.00 soon and $5.00 at the end of COVID-19**. Although it is currently not a large company, its continued aggressive expansion will soon put it as a force to be reckoned with.

**I am not a Financial Analyst, and this is not financial advice. This is purely my opinion on CTRM. I am currently close to $1000 invested in it and plan on investing more.**",1086,"

(NYSE American: DSS) (the “Company”), a multinational company operating businesses focusing on brand protection technology, blockchain security, direct marketing, healthcare, real estate, and securitized digital assets, today announced the pricing of an upsized underwritten public offering with gross proceeds to the Company expected to be approximately $24.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.  
>  
>The public offering equates to 6,666,666 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $3.60 per share. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with their existing cash, to fund the development and growth of new business lines, acquisition opportunities, and general corporate and working capital needs.

&#x200B;

For New or young investors:

A swing trade is when something is severely tanking (usually around 25%) on the announcing of an offering. The price normally tanks towards or near the offering price. In this case, that price is $3.60. A direct offering is better than a public offering because public offerings dilute shares, however the public offerings are still viable swing plays. In this case, it is a public offering. The object is to get in at or around the offering price and wait for the correction of the stock back to it's price before it was oversold. This is a genuinely easy way to watch your portfolio grow by 15%-30%. It may take a couple of weeks.

Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,MicroStrategy (MSTR) Short Thesis,"**Summary**

* MSTR core business revenue facing sixth straight year of decline.
* Speculating with bitcoin does not solve revenue problems.
* Switched treasury reserve from cash to Bitcoin, making three substantial purchases of bitcoin over the last four months.
* Recently announced offering of $650 million unsecured convertible senior notes intended to finance purchase of more bitcoin.

**Background**

There are times when companies are overvalued due to promise, potential, predictions, etc. This often makes sense as we often say that you invest on potential, not past. There are also times where companies are overvalued due to hype, and without much promise. MicroStrategy seems to be the latter (NASDAQ:MSTR).

Let me paint a picture for you. You are a global enterprise software company that has been successful for decades, but in the last 5-6 years, you have watched your platform and revenues begin to decline, despite the global market you partake in nearly doubling. Your platform and product has been top in class for over a decade, but your revenues cannot seem to keep up with market growth. You are in a good position in terms of debt to equity, and have a good sized cash position. With roughly $450 million in cash, you have ample opportunity to overhaul your product and do some R&D and attempt to improve your bottom line. What do you do?

**Buying Bitcoin Does Not Make You an Expert at Bitcoin**

MSTR’s management decided that the best plan of action would be to “pivot into the business of Bitcoin''. Yes, a global enterprise software company is now a “bitcoin company”, and they are not employing bitcoin engineers, or mining bitcoin, or anything of that nature, but are simply converting their treasury reserves into highly volatile bitcoin.

MicroStrategy CEO Michael J Saylor said, “MicroStrategy has recognized bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy”.

For everyone out there who thinks that bitcoin is a great treasury reserve, and loves this move, we understand that there are definitely arguments that can be made for and against this move, but one of the first questions we asked was, \~“did MSTR management just wake up one day back in August and decide that they were qualified to speculate in bitcoin with virtually their entire cash balance and do they have any idea what they are doing?”.

Our thesis is NO, they do not know what they are doing and here are a few reasons we think MSTR is overvalued at current prices.

Side Note: MSTR is joined by SQ (NYSE:SQ) and SRI (NYSE:SRI) as companies converting part or all of their treasury reserves to bitcoin over the last several months.

**Current Numbers**

MSTR invested roughly $475 million into bitcoin over three transactions taking place in August, September, and December. Below is how shareholders are currently exposed to this investment. On August 10, the day before their initial purchase, MSTR was trading at a market cap valuation of $1.297 billion. As of December 10, they are now trading at a market cap valuation of $2.59 billion. They went from trading around $122/share to $288 share, a $1.5 billion increase in market cap valuation credited due to an increase in their bitcoin investment value.

Since peaking in 2014, revenue has been declining year over year and with estimates of $474mm and $479mm for FY2020 and FY2021. This trend is not predicted to change.

P/E, P/S, Who Cares? We realize it is not 1986 anymore and that the Price to Earnings Ratio does not carry the clout in today’s market that it once did, but MSTR P/E is currently spiking at 2000, nearly 50x its 5-year average of 34x. In comparison, the US software industry carries an average P/E of 53x while US stocks currently carry a P/E of 19x. MSTR is extremely overvalued based on this number.

The same can be said about their Price to Sales Ratio. The US software industry carries an average P/S 2.72x and prior to their bitcoin purchase, MSTR had a P/S of 2.65x. Today, that has doubled to 5.77x since the first announcement of their initial bitcoin purchase.

**Tender Offer**

In mid September, MSTR executed a modified dutch auction to buyback shares at up to $140/share. They ended up repurchasing 432,313 shares at an aggregate cost of $60 million.

We had to read the following headline several times to believe it.

MicroStrategy Completes $650 Million Offering of 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025

First, we want to acknowledge that these terms are friendly towards MicroStrategy. The actual terms of the convertible debt do not bother us. What bothers us is the reason behind the raise.

These notes are convertible to 2.5126 shares of MSTR class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. This is a conversion price of approximately $397.99/share, more than a 37% premium to where MSTR last traded.

MSTR, an enterprise software company just took on $650 million in new debt to finance the purchase of more bitcoin. Assuming they use these proceeds exclusively to purchase more bitcoin, MSTR would have roughly $1.3 billion in bitcoin. The current market cap of total bitcoin sits around $350 billion.

At current market cap, $2.59 bil, an investor looking for bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy is entering as if the treasury bitcoin has increased by $139.53/share, or over 4x the actual change in bitcoin.

**Fair Valuation**

Based on the tender offer, the market accepted $140 as a fair valuation of operating assets which included the $456mm in cash.

$475mm of their current assets transitioned to bitcoin which is now worth $791mm, for a gain of $265mm.

Translating to per share, this gain equates to $27.92/share.

So for MSTR stock price to properly account for market’s expectations for their underlying business and actual growth in MSTR’s BTC position, it should be priced at $174.13

The new debt offering further reduces this valuation due to significantly increased leverage risk. These new senior debt holders will be the first in line to get paid from this $650mm investment in new bitcoin and possibly part or all of the existing bitcoin position if bitcoin drops below the purchase price. Equity holders will only see any value from this offering if bitcoin is above the purchase price at maturity.

Could MSTR just be ahead of a new normal? 2017/2018 was the last time bitcoin dominated the headlines and really spiked. The back half of 2020 is seeing a similar trend. What if MSTR is just ahead of the market? What if they actually are some of the smartest people in the room and they are seeing value where others cannot grasp it? What if the predictions of bitcoin reaching $1 million a coin by 2025 come true? We can “what if” this decision all we want, and perhaps MSTR is a future case in a class of 2030 MBA program. “The Smartest Ones on the Street” or “What in the World Were They Thinking”. It is not fair to only mention the “bad things that can happen” regarding MSTR. They truly could be onto something here. If bitcoin continues to thrive and grow, and become a more normalized asset, decreasing historical volatility, etc, then MSTR could be an early adopter of a legitimate future normalized business asset class. Perhaps our 1986, or even 2012 mindset are blocking us from seeing the next generation and revolution of business. Although we do not think this is the case as of yet, it is certainly a possibility.

**Managing Our Position**

We are not short shares of MSTR, but are long several PUTs. Our strikes range from $100 to $330 for the April 2021 expiration. We selected this expiration based on our belief that bitcoin is a cyclical, volatile asset class that will continue to see substantial swings. At current market cap, $2.59 bil, an investor looking for bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy is entering as if the treasury bitcoin has increased by $139.53/share, or over 4x the actual change in bitcoin. We believe the market will realize this and bring the price of MSTR down so that it moves in lock step with the actual value of bitcoin. We have targeted exit points at 20%, 30%, and 50% profit targets based on our belief of MSTR declining to its fair valuation over the next few months as bitcoin investment news fades and people realize the revenue and cash flow issues are real problems moving forward. We also have a soft stop loss of roughly 30% which we believe gives us the time and wiggle room needed for our analysis to come to fruition.

**Conclusion**

MicroStrategy is significantly overvalued based on its current assets and business operations. We feel that you are currently paying upwards of a 75% premium at current price levels and we feel that $174/share is a fair valuation based on revenue growth and true value of their bitcoin investment. This is not an ideal investment to get bitcoin exposure, and MicroStrategy is not an investment firm. We feel that they should be returning cash to investors, not speculating on bitcoin with their treasury reserve. We cannot predict how this experiment will play out, but we can assert what we feel is a fair valuation. Time will tell.

Disclosure: I am/we are short MSTR.

Additional disclosure: We are not short shares of MSTR, however, we have initiated several long PUTS across multiple expirations and strikes.

To provide a balanced viewpoint, here's an interview with MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor on his perspective - [http://youtube.com/watch?t=1851&v=Cg10yYZjK94](http://youtube.com/watch?t=1851&v=Cg10yYZjK94)",97,"Good analysis. However, given the fact that this company has become a sort of bitcoin ETF now, the stock price will move very correlated to the asset.

Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,Best Stock Ticker API for Programming Analysis?,"Hi all,

I'm interested in building a distressed investment strategy. I'd like to write a program that notifies me of new distressed assests - i.e. those which have decreased in price by X% in the last Y days.

Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,Darden Restaurants 2037 Bond,"
This is going to be a short write-up mainly because I am lazy, though if you have any questions/comments, I’ll respond in appropriate depth.

Darden restaurants is a casual and fine dining operator with a portfolio of brands containing the following well-known restaurants: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, and Eddie V’s, with them just recently acquiring Ruth Christ.

They are the largest company in their space, though unlike their QSR peers, they focus on expanding and investing company-owned and operated restaurants, not on franchising, though they do have franchisees as a result of acquired companies pursuing franchising, it is a non-core focus and not part of their core strategy.

For the next twelve months, they should produce 1.6B in operating cash flow roughly or 1.8B in EBITDA. Maintenance Capex including replacing estimated stores that will close is 315M for the NTM with 260M in planned net restaurant expansion capex for 43-48 net stores to be added to its base of over 1900.

They currently have, besides operating leases which are already expensed in EBITDA, 5 debt profiles, 2027 bonds, 2035 bonds, 2037 bonds, and 2048 bonds, along with a 600M Term loan for its recent acquisition total 1.54B in long-term debt obligations excl. associated interest. They also have finance lease liabilities of 1.2B with 44M of interest in 2023 FY ended May 31, 2023 making total interest expense 125M-130M for FY2023 likely (term loan is floating).

Ok now that we are done with the business/financial expose, the thesis here is on the 2037 bonds which over the last 15 years have been bought significantly in open market repurchases due to their high 6.8% coupon with the current amount left being 42.8M from the original 300M face value.

Though DRI is BBB rated by S&P/Moody’s, they are unreliable and with the BBB spread at 150BP to 180BP on treasuries, these bonds should at surface level be trading for 5.75% to 6.0% YTM, yet they are at a very attractive 7.40%

Now lets go a bit deeper, these bonds were issued in 07’ and due to the company being half the size then and a bunch of acquisition occurring at once, an amendment was added which in the case of credit downgrade below BBB, the coupon could be increase up to 2.000% from 6.80% coupon, but it can’t go down below 6.80%, where it is currently. This offers a pretty nice safety net.

The other important thing is that even though the credit rating agencies are rating them BBB rn, they are full of crap. The 600M floating rate 3y term loan issued for the Ruth Christ acquisition has a interest rate of any Term SOFR + 1.10%, a spread only given to companies rated A/AA as of now. the 2027 bonds are also trading at 5.46% YTM or 100BP spread and 2035 which are similar to the 2037 in question at 6.15% YTM, and the 2048 at 5.80% YTM or 140BP spread.

I’m not sure why the 2037 bonds are trading at the highest spread of 340BP and their only unique nature is the credit deterrioration addition which is only a positive, and with open market purchases and the non-callable nature, liquidity is pretty acceptable. It is probably liquidity tho but the 7.38% YTM was on August 16th and there is a couple of trades 3every few days, so liquidity isn’t bad, especially for the 42.8M in remaining face value.

I think a yield of 7%-7.40% is an absolute steal for bonds of A/AA company that is the only aggregator in its industry and has reliable cash flow with FCF of 1050-1150 for the NTM including growth capex equivalent to a FCF/Interest coverage ratio of around 8x-9x!!",19,[deleted],"I think the cyclical nature of the restaurant business is probably what's reflected in lower credit rating. The agencies typically limit their ratings for cyclical industries. 

Typically anything less than $500M is pretty illiquid in the credit market, and those eye popping yields are probably dealer gouging retail traders. If you can actually buy at >7% then I think its a good trade",
Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,R data wrangling tutorial: calculating volume weighted average stock price,"Hey folks, not sure how much demand is out there, but thought I would start a YouTube series teaching programming with a focus on capital markets.

Here's my first video, where I walk through how to calculate a volume weighted average share price in R using data wrangling techniques.

Will be doing first series in R. Starting off with the basics like data wrangling, visualization and regression, will then move into more complicated topics like deep learning, application development, trading strategies, equity analysis/valuation, alternative data analysis, econometrics, text analysis, etc... From there, I'll do similar courses in Python, SQL, C++ and then JavaScript.

Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,My first investment (finally!),"The stock?


Debenhams (LSE:DEB). Of the many people I have spoken to both online and IRL about this, only one person also agreed that it offered potential. Everyone else said that retail was dead, Debenhams was a terrible pick within a terrible market and that I was stupid. I think therefore it's safe to say I've fully taken on-board Mohnish Pabrai's advice in Dhandho Investor to 'buy distressed businesses in distressed industries'.


The investment merits as far as I am concerned are:

•	Other UK bricks & mortar retailers going into administration is creating worry and depressing the stock prices of other retailers.

•	I believe that their business strategy to drive more footfall and cut excess footage by utilising space for gyms and restaurants is a very good idea.

•	There is a focus on Beauty within the business, an industry segment that is growing rapidly.

•	Strong e-com growth, and the CEO, Sergio Bucher, being ex-Amazon gives me confidence they'll continue to do well here.

•	The recent, heavy discounting by other retailers, including House of Fraser hurting profit is likely to reduce now that House of Fraser has found a buyer in Mike Ashley, a 29% owner of Debenhams. The two chains are now less likely to commit mutually destructive acts. Additionally, Mike Ashley is regarded as a great trader so having him as a prominent stakeholder is a plus.

•	Low profit margin, which can be useful in a turnaround business as a small increase in profit margin will have big a big impact on earnings.

o	This is also a big risk if profit margin decreases further, which is a real possibility if the pound continues to fall.


The downsides:

•	Earnings and cash flow have been decreasing for the last 10 years and this negative growth has accelerated in recent years.

o	I believe that the new strategy of the business will begin to turn it around and that if earnings do not grow, the stock is still so undervalued that the investment should still not lose money.

•	There is no discernible durable competitive advantage that stands them out from other big UK retailers.

o	Debenhams has good physical locations across the country and a growing online presence. Due to the relatively straight-forward nature of retail, they will be able to copy the strategy of other retailers if the concept is proved. Bucher’s strategy however is time-consuming to implement and as they will be the first retailers to get a sense of whether or not it worked, they will be in a good place to fully implement this before the arbitrage opportunity of having restaurants/gyms in-store disappears.

•	The overall UK bricks and mortar retail sector is performing poorly and with the ever-growing e-commerce industry posing a huge threat, there is a chance that a snowball effect takes place with high streets emptying resulting in lower footfall and causing more shops to go out of business.

o	The strong e-com growth Debenhams has shown means that if more and more consumers choose to buy their fashion online, it should be able to grow sales further through this channel.


The value:

Share price at purchase = 11.7p (Mkt Cap = £144m)

Estimated earnings for year-end September 2018 = £28m (=£35m PBT * 80%).

LY basic EPS = 4p

At a PE of 5 using estimated earnings (3 using LY earnings) compared with a 5-year median PE of 9.8, the stock is undervalued compared to its historic self and very undervalued compared to its peers.

Mike Ashley paying £90m for a private company with a similar, albeit a bit more high-end, offer to Debenhams that is currently unprofitable and requiring a CVA to continue trading suggests to me he would value Debenhams at a lot more than £144m. In fact, he did value Debenhams at significantly more than £144m when he built up his 30% stake.

The analysts’ consensus of £28m earnings would give a profit margin of 1.2% (assuming revenue stays constant with LY). A 0.1% increase of profit margin would result in an 8% earnings growth, whilst a return to the 5-year median profit margin of 3.7% would yield 208% earnings growth.

I currently believe the stock could easily climb to at least 40p if the company’s strategy allows it to return to revenue growth. Even if this is not the case, the astute trading mentality of Mike Ashley could hopefully provide similar results by increasing profit margin from its current all-time low.

Any feedback/comments are very welcome!

Whilst many of you may disagree with the stock pick, without the reading material supplied through this sub-reddit I wouldn't have had the confidence to take an independent viewpoint on it and certainly would not have put my money where my mouth is! So whether you agree or disagree with the pick, thanks for playing a part in helping me formulate my own investing opinions.


Edit: formatting",14,"In a previous post you mentioned that this was the first company that you have seriously researched. Do you think it's possible that sunk cost fallacy played a role in this investment? It's difficult to abandon an idea after spending a lot of time on it. Did you go into the process trying to find all of the skeletons, or did you spend more time confirming your hypothesis? I ask because finding an actionable idea on your first try is pretty rare. ","And now for the hard part. Following a deep value strategy is about holding an opinion that everyone will disagree with. Unless your ready to defend your opinion when the crowd (market) is telling you on any day that it's worth 50% less than what you paid, you have no business investing in deep value. Study closely Munger's '73/'74 performance, Burry's AHA investment and Einhorn's last three years.   ","Good luck.

Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,Do you feel like security analysis is worth it (as opposed to investing in the S&P)?,"I work as a quantitative trader and use models / machine learning to trade on shorter time frames. I invest most of my money in the S&P, but have some portion that I allocate to quantitative strategies. I believe that I have edge in this because of my expertise in the field, and I enjoy the strategy development process. Do you feel like you can achieve excess returns through value investing? What has your journey been like? Would you consider security analysis a hobby?

&#x200B;

Edit: feels like a lot of replies are that it doesn't make money, because of the swaths of competition. Do you think this is true even in the face of small cap names which aren't worth the time or effort of hedge funds?",49,"**TL;DR**: Yes.

As long as you realize that pure quant analysis and pure fundamental analysis are two sides of the same coin, you'll learn to sift through the three-blind-mice style banter that I'm sure you've seen between supposed ""quants"" and ""Buff-heads"". There are absolutely merits to both approaches, and the holy grail is to marry both of them.

I used to work at a firm that strictly used quantitative trading signals based off of price and volume action, so my thoughts here are limited to that type of approach. The general basis for a lot of these strategies is that stock prices are a random walk around a drift term. It's imperative to isolate these random walks so that using Gaussian distribution-based (or other symmetrical) statistical theory isn't THAT far off from the actual movements in the prices of securities. The best way to achieve this is to trade on short-term time frames. This also holds up to the ""smell-test"", because changes in underlying fundamental factors that should ultimately alter the intrinsic value of a particular security don't change nearly as frequently (or as violently) as price movements alone would indicate, and human behavior is emotional which leads to short-term overreactions. This is where quant firms find an edge; assuming that the price movement of securities over shorter time horizons are overreactions or temporary mispricings based on almost no change in fundamentals.

Fundamental analysis takes the complete opposite view. Great value investors focus very intently on the drift term, and tend to discount or ignore the ""white noise"" portion of that equation. The reason it's so reliable is that patterns, signals, short-term behaviors, and events will come and go somewhat arbitrarily (which means quants have to live in a framework filled with cross-validations and backtesting) while the fundamental principles of running a business rarely change that quickly. Fundamental analysis is anchored in how businesses run in terms of real life cash flows, not some complex and fragile mathematical abstraction that can either make you rich or ruin you at fiber-optic speed. Real life is messier than a lot of models will allow for. The only reason it's hard to be a value-based investor is that sometimes your thesis doesn't materialize in the short to medium-term. People are extremely short-sighted by nature. They're impatient, fickle, and unapologetic for being so. But in the long-term, economic rationality and logic wins 99% of the time.

In terms of indexing vs. active security selection, there is absolutely alpha to be generated. However, that alpha isn't easy, which is what discourages a lot of people. But the ""return on invested time"", if you will, can be much greater and much more persistent than what simple indexing can provide. If I told you that the S&P had a CAGR of 7%, while venture capital had a CAGR of 20%, would you be interested? A lot of people are, and it just takes sound financial decision-making and calculated risk-taking to do so.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all about geeking out over AIC and optimization, but you have to at least understand the boundaries of the realm in which you're operating for it to be sustainable.","I find my allocation of least regret is at least 50% of my capital in a stock market index with the remainder in speculative, unprofitable microcaps on the verge of self funding (which requires a fair amount of DD). This allows me to stay invested at all times and hopefully enjoy outsized returns on the (typically illiquid and unknown) microcaps.

So yeah, I definitely treat it as a hobby.","as far as i know there have been lots of studies and it essentially comes down this:

the average performance of stock returns based on security analysis including all types of funds is about 1-2% below the market return. You then also have to consider the higher level of transaction fees you will be paying which will correspond to another approximately 1-2%. The same findings apply when studies look at only large very professionally managed funds, so unfortunately you are off to a bad start and it gets worse. 

On average, the higher the number of transactions per year investors in equities perform, the lower the returns. This means the more short term orientated investors are the lower the return and funnily enough the delta here (to sound like the guy who posted before) is about the the additional fees incurred by more frequent trading. 

Now boys from underprivileged families with rags to riches fantasies of becoming a stock trader because they forgot their lunch money on kitchen counter one day and  read buffets books 11 times will say this: ""Thats only because there are many people who don't know what they are doing"" Like I said the same (or even worse iirc?) applies for professional funds. If you think for some reason you are special and that you can do it irrespectively just know that you're expected return is about 0.96\*market performance, so generally its a bad investment. even if somehow you manage to double you money in a day and you think you have defied the statistics already remember it only takes one trade to lose all your gains. If you make 100% on day and lose 100% then next you have nothing. 

If you think what I am writing is nonsense because there are investors such as buffet out there, who have consistently defied the market, consider this: Buffets first big break was when he purchased insurance businesses and started investing the huge positive working capital they had lying around, which goes a lot further than reading some annual reports and news articles. Not to mention in recent years he's focusing on creating synergies and professionalizing firms once they are part of his conglomerate. And last but not least you have to realize that buffets returns since the start of his career to the present day have been about 26 standard deviations from the markets returns. what that mean is that if buffet had only ever chosen stocks by pulling them out of a hat with all the SP500 company names written on pieces of paper in it, he would have around a 1 in 4 million chance of achieving the returns he has done. There many millions of investors and he is the most successful one, so luck has likely played a role in his career, not to mention eventually the ""buffet effect"" became significant as well.

So as you alluded to in you question, i think it is more of a hobby than a job. The way finance creates value is by allocating capital to people who can best use it, and whatever you are doing as a day trader or whatever, it is not that. The only way to beat the market is to have information or insight others don't and then they have to be accurate. So if you are a car engineer perhaps you could choose the best car stock (thats the idea) but I wouldn't count on it. Sorry to be that guy but I hope I can save you some time and money. I encourage you to do your own research. Given that the nature of finance is about assessing risk and probabilities of returns I am surprised by how many people are blind to these facts. In a bear market things may be different than i described although I know of no evidence that suggests so. Oh and dont get me started on technicals. ps excuse my writing i was in a hurry"
Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,Automated Strategy: Beating the Index [cross-post from r/algotrading],"Hi SecurityAnalysis, I'd like to share an automated strategy I came up with that shows some promising results. I'd like to quickly just share a broad overview of the mechanics of the strategy, followed by a look at the risk and return characteristics of the strategy. I am by no means a math whiz or investing expert, so all manner of critique is more than welcome.

# Mechanics

The strategy is pretty brain dead simple: at the end of every year, take an index (the S&P 500 in this example), filter out a basket of high quality stocks, equal weight those stocks, and hold for one year; rinse and repeat every year. The filter is an equity screen I made that I believe crystalizes a group of companies with best-in-class management, economic moat, and financial stability while also trading at an attractive valuation. This is *not* a predictive model, I cannot tell you which of these stocks will shine, nor by how much; but I *can* say that the underlying qualities these stocks were selected for will perform strongly. The final list of stocks is equal weighted to gain equal exposure to these qualities.

# ***Edit: Details missed and caught in comments***

* The portfolio holds between 25-40 stocks year over year with annual turnover of about 85% (remember though that it only trades once per year).
* The portfolio is sector neutral.
* Sortino for the total period is 1.89.

# Performance

To evaluate performance, I backtested this strategy using a Bloomberg Terminal for the longest time period allowed, which is December 1999 to present. In breaking down performance, I'll be showing the total return, as well as rolling five and ten year returns compared to the S&P 500.

&#x200B;

**Total Performance**

https://preview.redd.it/zp4dthgg79c21.jpg?width=670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5da3c032c9ae1eccfacda5d4ceef6d4851d74034

Over the 19-year period, the Strategy showed a total return of 866.3% versus 161.9% for the index with a market beta of 0.95. On a compounded annual return basis, the strategy returned about 12% per year versus 5.1% for the S&P 500. Regarding risk, the strategy showed a standard deviation of 16.3% versus 15.0% for the index. Maximum drawdown was also slightly higher for the strategy at -53.8% versus the benchmark of -47.8%.

&#x200B;

**Five Year Performance**

https://preview.redd.it/y9vpz68k79c21.jpg?width=694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1de7d74e09a2188e335a0ca388b43000834cc72

Regarding performance over five year holding periods, the strategy has outperformed the index during every single five-year period from inception to December 2018. The degree of outperformance was most dramatic during the first five-year period, while subsequent periods cluster around an average cumulative outperformance of 39.1%, or about 7.8% per year.

&#x200B;

**Ten Year Performance**

https://preview.redd.it/v2g7hmxk79c21.jpg?width=694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86a349fbaa66cddb9301db8ca20ae689a17e88d8

Regarding performance over ten year holding periods, the strategy has outperformed the index during every single ten-year period from inception to December 2018 .The degree of outperformance was again most dramatic during the first ten-year period, while subsequent periods cluster around an average cumulative outperformance of 86.6%, or about 8.7% per year.

# Bonus Round: Factor Models and Warren Buffet

Some may be wondering how the returns look when run through various factor models. Below are the stat outputs from CAPM, Fama-French 3 Factor and Fama-French 5 Factor. For bonus points I'll also throw in a comparison to one of my favorite investors of all time, Warren Buffet.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/

Note your backtest starts at the height of the dot com bubble and from the looks of it the majority of your outperformance comes from the 2000-2002 time period as well. Which makes sense because your portfolio has a valuation bias and likely didn't select tech stocks during the period. I would doubt you have captured much outperformance post that period...","As someone who wrote fundamentally based quant models for several years, my impression is this it is very easy to create backtests that perform this well or better. I wrote several while completely wasted in college that had 20%+/yr returns that looked pretty repeatable over a similar period (even when sober).

In realtime testing they had alphas much closer to 1-2% and between taxes/turnover, the cost of the data and time spent, it was worth it to just buy index funds. If I wanted to get back into this world, I'd probably buy MOAT or another quality-based ETF.

Several things to remember about quant models:

1. Diversification has a relatively low value beyond 20 positions or so
2. With anything but micro-caps, you are far from the only person trying to find quant factors
3. For most portfolios, backtesting looks way better than forward testing. If you don't believe me, look at the community portfolios over at Portfolio123. Some of these people are novices. Some know a fair amount. A large number of them fail to beat the market over reasonable time-frames (remember that you're looking at a heavy selection-bias sample even with those views). Also, its worth reading what Ben Graham has to say on the subject, I think he's generally right
4. You need to factor the cost of the data/tools, taxes and transaction fees into your returns
5. You can find factors that generate sustainable, long-run alpha but its really fucking hard to do right to a level that makes it worthwhile","Good point by LeftOnBurnside. 

OP, what would it look like if you start in 2004, or at 2011?

What could go wrong?",257,"[Barron’s covers it well](https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-is-going-on-with-the-stock-market-heres-one-answer-51599241222): 

“Barron’s previously reported that Softbank had started making big bets on tech stocks, including Amazon, Alphabet, and Adobe (ADBE), during the June quarter.

Whether it was all SoftBank or not is moot. Bullish call-option buying has exploded. Over the past month, traders have bought almost 15 times the number of call options expiring in November of those FAANG stocks, plus Microsoft and Tesla, than the equivalent number of put options.

....


When call-option buying spikes, it drives call sellers to buy underlying stock, sending shares higher. When brokers sell options contracts, they don’t want to take the risk of what happens to the underlying stock. Brokers only want to earn a commission selling—and trading—the options. Often times, brokers buy underlying stock to hedge their book of business. That way, any gains or losses on options positions are offset by corresponding gains in the underlying stock prices.

So any explosion in call-option buying generates stock buying on the Street. That’s one way to explain the 20% rise of those tech stocks since July.

It’s also a way to explain the recent two day collapse. Call-option trading volume Thursday in those tech stocks was down by roughly two-thirds compared with recent highs.”","I can't recall which fund manager mentioned this, but he said his firm wasn't in the business of trying to move markets because you can get trapped with dangerous positions.

The stock may be undervalued, but the options could theoretically be massively overvalued relative to the stock. Or maybe the stock is trading around intrinsic value, but the option is massively undervalued relative to the stock.

Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,What are your strategies to evaluate leverage and find potential bankruptcies during this period?,"Basically trying to find hidden gem equities that are presently trading like options due to being dragged down by the virus, and the resulting macro environment.

If you want to go long an equity that's priced for bankruptcy, Mohnish Pabrai is extremely effective at this. He runs an extremely high beta fund, but his strategy works exceptionally well at compounding as the economy recovers. The key is to not go in too fast because >50% losses are very hard to dig oneself out of.  

You want to look for companies with discrete cashflows that can roll their debt. A good example is an oil refinery or a funeral home. You can sell 1-2 refineries at firesale prices and get cash to pay debt. Because they have value over time and can't be reproduced, they have value in bankruptcy.

Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,Hedging Strategies,"Have any fundamental analysts here been effective at putting on hedges over time? (Not interested in day trading perspectives...)

My questions for you include:

1. Do you stick to equity markets, such as put options on overvalued securities?

2. If equity, how do you determine the expiration date and strike price(s)? Do you just use short term options, a few months out, or do you buy longer dated options for 1-2 years away? If longer term, do you have to stick to the indices? There doesn't seem to be much volume for individual names where you might want to bet on a 50% decline, but have to use 2022 because you don't know when the tide will go out.

3. How do you think about hedges? Do you allocate a portion, maybe  1/4-1/2 percent as an annual cost, or do you just hedge when you have specific concerns in varying portfolio allocations?

4. Have you ever taken hedges in currencies or interest rates? If so, what was the learning process like in terms of understanding the mechanics and putting on the correct bet. I'm a fundamental analyst and might have a view on some of these, or at least want to take on tail risk hedges, but have no experience executing trades like this. Can you take on trades that react to a specific interest rate instead of trying to calculate bond values at a particular date? (The further I move away from my circle of competence, the less I'll understand...

Edit: To be clear, I'm looking less for general guidance and more for the technical aspects. I'm versed on the basics (CFA charter, work experience, etc.) and am not dealing with existential questions of whether one should hedge or not...",15,"You can also just hedge by picking stocks with good risk:reward fundamentals. A lot of people forget that. 

Owning a portfolio with 20 such stocks can give you a better risk profile at lower cost than any hedging instrument. Then if the return is still not up to your liking, you can lever up to your ideal risk:reward level.

Intelligent investing involves natural hedges. Utilizing hedging instruments isn't really necessary.","not a big expert but some things worked better for me than others:


If you look to hedge tail risk then probably you should look at ""units"" (very far OTM puts).  Because you are buying far OTM you only have big indexes as real alternative cause once liquidity dries up you will not get a good price to hedge.

Such a hedge will normally kick in when you have a serious rug pull and can do wonders for your Sharpe ratio, and is relatively cheap: you can throw probably like 0.5% of principal into it but will only matter if you have 20% drop or something.

However volatility now us still pretty high all over the board and hedging now for a deflationary event (like buying puts on SPX/SPY) is very expensive.  Generally with VIX above 20 is expensive to hedge. 

To choose a strike I normally go to something like 0.05-0.1 delta or even lower (and buy a few of them). As for time ... that will depend on what is your scenario that you want to hedge for.  Like for example .. will the stimulus get delayed and they will start doing shit politics ... then probably that will unravel in the next few months and the I will pick +3-4 months out ... so lets say my event will be Feb then I will be looking at May June.

You can hedge also with VIX calls, yet again now everything is expensive. You will want to buy also far OTM calls around $0.5 for VIX.

These ones don't decay like normal options and they are European (can't be exercised early) so you can buy closer to your event date.

Another hedge will be to buy calls on GLD or /GC but this is kinda different than above because if you have a sell-off gold will fall along with everything. However you are betting here that if things get nasty,  then fed/treasury/politicians will throw the towel and  print and when this happens normally gold rebounds fast.  Here you can get closer to ATM and buy leaps (1-2 years). The advantage here is that in current environment GLD tends to drift higher anyway as long interest rates are around zero.  So you can actually make money from you hedge. Of course once the economy will rebound and Fed will stop QE/rise rates ... then your position in gold derivatives will evaporate :)","It would depend on the goal and type of fundamental analysis. As a disclaimer, take this with a grain of salt because I’m some random guy on reddit. 

TD/DR: my response sort of answers 2 and 3. 


If you’re doing anything value related, there is no need to hedge. If you’re sure that a stock is undervalued, but may take years to realize, then you’re just holding on. Even if the share price dips (for some arbitrary reason, that doesn’t change your thesis), there won’t be any material need to hedge. You may say “what about if you’re wrong?” To which I would respond that if you have a doubt about the undervaluation of the company, make sure to account for it in your valuation. If there are any material changes to the company, reevaluate and either hold or sell. 

If on the other hand you’re making a directional play, or a more short term trade (like within a year), then hedging may have a role. For example, I just read that GM is backing out of their investment in Nikola; they won’t be taking an equity stake or building the trucks. Perhaps if you bought into Nikola under the thesis that they will be a leader in EV semi trucks, but were worried about the viability of the business mode, or the short-report, you could have bought in-the-money puts (at your cost basis say) with an expiry within the year. In theory, your max loss from the hedge would be the price you paid for the puts, while your max gain would be whatever the stock increases by minus the cost of your puts. The hedge would essentially be a married put."

I'm very open to discussion.",39,Why is it free optionality if the sponsor gets 20% after closing?,"Just so you know, the fact shares trade at or below NAV before the redemption deadline is an indicator the market doesn't like the acquisition and shares will not trade well ex redemption date.","Clarification of the general investment thesis:  
  
You could see $VACQ as a 10 dollar investment in short-term US government treasuries + a ""call option"" on post-merger $VACQ (so effectively on the implied Rocket Lab valuation). As $VACQ currently trades around 10 dollars you effectively get this ""call option"" for free. (It is not literally a call option but I find it a nice way to grasp the general investment thesis).  
  
The free ""call option"" in that case has as underlying 1 post-merger share of $VACQ (so the Rocket Lab valuation determines the value) with a strike price of 10 and expiration date equal to the redemption deadline.  
  
I like free call options. Especially when there are signals that they are valuable. You could run a valuation yourself but I'm taking a shortcut here by just following Michael Burry in this case. I also like that Rocket Lab is exciting/sexy/speculative/futuristic/glamorous, as stock prices of such companies generally exhibit higher volatility, which implies a higher value for its (call) options.  
  
So a bit mind-boggling but with $VACQ you are basically buying a financial security that has included a free call option on that same financial security.

Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,"Nomura Warns Of Imminent ""Gamma-Flip"" Risk In Stocks","Nomura's Charlie McElligott explains below is simple - what forced self-reinforcing buying pressure on the way up is about to feed a vicious cycle of selling on the way down as stocks face an imminent ""gamma flip.""

And McEligott explains:

The interpretation of Trump’s “better to wait until after the election” for a China trade deal comments is that the Hong Kong human rights bill sponsorship by POTUS has clearly caused agitated the Chinese side (plus this morning’s Reuters report stating that the White House is considering kicking Huawei out of the US banking system), and in conjunction with the narrowing window to act on the Dec 15th tariff “fill or kill,” **is likely incentivizing monetization of of the +9% gain made in S&P since early October via profit-taking in recently Options- ($Delta still 94th %ile since 2013 even after yday’s selloff) and Futures- (Asset Manager S&P Futures $notional position currently 99.6th %Ile since 2006 at $141.7B) positioning “extremes.”**

*This “extreme positioning” into a dynamic where traders are incentivized to monetize into year-end—especially ahead of the Dec 15th “tariff risk”—has been at the core of my view over the past few weeks that there was a local / tactical “window for a pullback” into late November (start Dec ain’t bad though).*

As such, this risk-off dynamic is driving the bid in Rates / USTs (*Reds and Greens +6 to +8 ticks, while we’ve seen Real Money and Central Bank buying flows in the front-end—thus the “bull steepening”),* which too then will almost certainly result in a reversal later today of the US Equities factor dynamic experienced on Monday (Momentum down, Value up); instead, **today’s UST rally will then dictate a resumption of the “Momentum” bounce-back experienced over the past 3 weeks, as longs in “Duration” Equities (“Min Vol” Defensives and “Secular Growth”) are set to rally, with “Cyclicals” are likely to again fall.**

Touching on my constant refrain over the past two years—that being where a “macro shock” then acts as catalyst for Dealer Gamma “flip” and / or in conjunction with a Systematic Trend deleveraging impulse—we see a mixed-bag, as our **Nomura QIS CTA model shows the majority of Equities futures positions remain “in trend” and ABOVE estimated deleveraging / “sell” levels.**

What does it tell us?

The Gamma of an option measures the rate of change of the option delta. Its' number is denoted relative to a one point move in the underlying asset. For example, if the gamma for an option shows 0.015 with a delta of 0.45 then a full point move in the stock (i.e. 35 to 36) means the delta will move to 0.465.

Gamma is calculated via an option model such as Black and Scholes or Binomial. The value is the same for both call and put options.

The Gamma of an option is important to know because the delta of an option is not constant; the delta increases and decreases as the underlying moves. Because delta is essentially our position value in the underlying, the gamma therefore tells traders how fast their position will increase or decrease in value vs movements in the underlying asset. 

In other words, Gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset. So, watching your gamma will let you know how large your delta (position risk) changes. 

**Since the chart above shows us high gamma for strike prices between 3095 and 3155 it tells us that the SP500 can get very volatile around these trading ranges. Its like playing with dynamite throwing it back and forth until it explodes.**",63,"Where can you look at gamma flip for free at any given time?

Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Auckland Airport Beginner Fundamental Analysis,"Hey guys,

Any advice/direction on how to better the analysis would be greatly appreciated as most of the valuations are around half of the current share price.

However, it lacks strength in ROE (advised was 10-15% avg.) and FCF (advised was positive FCF over 10yr).

TIA.",34,"basic questions--

why would you use book value here?

why would you think there would be profit growth here?

why would you think there would be any current roe here?

best way to look at a good government backed monoply is there is usually a regulatory amount the monopoly can charge to keep it in check.  is there an austrailian transportation division that sets rates?  who is ahead of the equity payouts, what kind of debt, owed to whom?

How has austrailia handled airport bankruptcies in the past...did they restructure the equity out?","I imagine that the big challenge with this kind of projection in the current environment is that you have to make assumptions about Covid-19/International Travel which are at best, a bit of a guess. With that said, monopolistic assets like this are rarely a bad investment.","The fund I worked for looked at this briefly when they did their initial COVID raise. Basically, wasn't really in our mandate but also as [theleveragedsellout](https://www.reddit.com/user/theleveragedsellout/), mentioned you have to make covid assumptions. 

Without giving you investment or business advice and going off your analysis only, my feedback would be:  


EPS - fundamental issue with your P/E analysis is that you have taken COVID performance (via your EPS) and applied a multiple to this. The street are factoring in a return to normality in EPS which in turn pushes up their willingness to pay vs your analysis.  


P/E - using any multiple you are making implicit assumptions about growth and discount rates (and in the case of a P/E assumptions around reinvestment rates). I think using historical averages can be a good guide as to how the market sees these things in the past but I would look to construct this yourself on a go forward basis given there has been a significant change in these variables. Secondly, my former point around EPS has a signficant effect on the P/E multiple, you are using a normal state of the world multiple with COVID earnings which is why your share price is so low.   


NAV Analysis - I think although a good sense check, the price this gives you is a bit academic in the context of a business like an airport. I would use to check against your target price in order to generate a P/B ratio. I always like to sense check the P/E I am using against P/B and ROE (noting that: P/E \* ROE = P/B). Breaking it down can always help you grasp the inputs in your analysis. For the same reasons, regularly check your ROE outputs through Du-Pont. 

Never used net / net so can't give any feedback. 

For the growth model: 1. (COVID EPS issue from above). 2. Not quite sure what your assumptions are but again sense check them how realistic do you think they are? A one stage model is incredibly inflexible. The next simplest version is to have a 2 stage model and more complex version is creating a DCF. This gives you the flexibility to change assumptions as the years go by.   


Other  


Make sure you use fully diluted shares in your analysis. 

Not sure if your Operating CF was from the CF statement or was constructed using FCFF, be careful as there are a few adjustments you need to make if you use the CF statement (financing costs, SBC).

Look to assess banking headway and covenants in your analysis as this will alert to: chances of a dilutive equity raise, chances of a reorg event in which the equity is in trouble of being wiped.

Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Fundamental analysis books + DCF modeling,"Can anyone recommend me a practical fundamental analysis book that teaches actual methods for putting a quantitative valuation on a business? 

I've read many books recently but they all seem tied to teaching about temperament and mindset.

---

Here's what I've read recently:

The Intelligent Investor - It's one of the more quantitative books I've read but the actual methods are outdated. He mainly looks for good companies with strong balance sheets but i didn't see any part where he's putting target prices on the companies.

The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks

Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman

Beating the Street by Peter Lynch - mostly relative valuations and going to malls for research. I would like to hear his thoughts on that now since the advent of econmerce.

The Little Book that Still Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt - this one has some quantitative analysis in it but it's really too simplified and his ""magic formula"" seems like a ploy so people buying into Gotham's portfolio if you check their 13F

----

I've been looking into Aswath Damadoran since he seems to be one of the few that talks about the actual valuation method (DCF).  Do people recommend any specific books of his? I watched his Google talks and have been looking into The Little Book of Valuation. Are there any others?

Also, I've heard that Buffett says that you shouldn't be calculating it all down to 2+ decimals. He says he does it quickly in his head. It makes sense since he's looking at 1000's of companies and there should be a margin of safety.

Aswath seems to take it down to the deep end looking into WACC's, APV's, and making large excel sheets. 

I can't see Buffett making excel models for all of the companies he's sifting through since he doesn't even use a computer. Do you guess that he filters companies out with relative analysis then does a rough mental DCF model in his head from all his experience? 

Anyways, thanks in advance. I'm attempting to read a lot but I'm having some trouble consolidating everything into an actual practical method. I don't mind number crunching a spreadsheet but it seems unreasonable to do it for every 10K you're reading. I guess I answered my own question.

- The only way to really understand what a company is worth is to literally dedicate years of your life to understanding A) Finance B) Accounting C) Statistics/Economics.  Without a serious understanding of all 3 of those areas, you are just scratching the surface.

That doesn't mean you can't make money like Pabrai and some other guys do with very basic rule of thumb investing (P/B etc.).

Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Is there any serious analysis for finding the fundamental value of cryptocurrencies?,"I mostly invest in traditional stocks and bonds.  I have been for 30+ years.  More recently, I've been investing in pre-IPO startups.

In all of these cases, I've been able to assign a value of what I think a particular security is worth, or could be worth, using traditional means:  estimate future cash flows, discount to present value, etc.

I had the opportunity to buy a particular cryptocurrency before it started trading on the open market.  (Kind of a pre-ipo cryptocurrency.)  I am wondering what it will be worth once it starts trading.  My best guess encompasses a range from $0.10 to $2.00  (I bought it for $0.02).  It should start trading next week.

The ""security analysis"" process that people seem to follow  is to rank all the different cryptocurrencies based on how useful they are or something like that.  Then compare it to the ""market cap"" of a similar ranking cryptocurrency.

They define the ""market cap"" as the total number of cryptocurrency coins available times the price per coin. For instance, right now the #50 ranked coin is something called Kusama (KSM) and it has a market cap of $3.3 billion.  

One problem with this analysis is that some of these coins have built in dilution.  They may have 1 million available right now, but in 5 years it will be 10 million.  I don't think people take this into account.


How do you determine what these should be worth?  It seems like this is a wide open problem and solving it could lead to great wealth.",52,"Crypto does not have fundamental value, at best they have a relative value","There exists ""fundamental"" analysis of different protocols and their respective coins from analysts who apply value investing concepts to crypto but its use is creative at best and speculative at worst. Note that I don't think being ""creative"" is a bad thing, it's just a reflection of the fact that the application of valuation concepts to crypto shines a light on the limits of valuation concepts themselves.

Some ""bridges"" for people who view themselves as ""fundamental"" analysts who are seriously looking at crypto are from analysts/PMs who have had both hats (equities -> crypto) on themselves - here are my recommendations:  


\- from an MapleLeadCapital/FoliusVentures (ex-fundamental HF guy, now running crypto venture): ""MLC Web3 Defi Primer"" - probably the most cogent for analysts used to deep fundamental research [https://twitter.com/MapleLeafCap/status/1339346115322376192](https://twitter.com/MapleLeafCap/status/1339346115322376192)

&#x200B;

The best argument for ""fundamental"" value (ex-relative) that I've seen is in deflationary coins that produce dividend-like flows (which can be converted into cash) as in the case of post-EIP 1559 Ethereum, which I've roughly modeled out a couple months back using a DCF template w/ stock buyback component. Frankly, building a fundamental model out of ETH was probably *more* ""fundamental"" in nature than valuation of most SaaS privates and even publics in the current market. Certain protocols that *technically* aren't crypto but utilize decentralized economic mechanisms in order to allocate compute and storage can arguably *also* be analyzed on a similar basis to the way AWS/Azure/GCP business segments are (I'm thinking Filecoin, Arweave, etc. in which you could comp S3 storage rates to Filecoin storage rates & then extrapolate fees, margin compresson, market size/TAM, evolution of value capture, etc.)

In general, [Bankless's substack](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/) has a lot of good material for formulating how one *could* fundamentally value different, less-known coins, but I treat the content as priming material and not like a more rigorous sell-side research report.

My live reading list is here for reference: [https://www.notion.so/dcfstate/Crypto-Blockchain-f1ba267be6a849308b63ba68859df2b6](https://www.notion.so/dcfstate/Crypto-Blockchain-f1ba267be6a849308b63ba68859df2b6)

Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Tools for Fundamental Analysis?,"Hi so I have gotten into building financial models for companies and am running into problems when making revenue projections.

Essentially my problem is that I need a tool that will help me to know the full market-cap and market share that a company has for any particular space.

For example lets say I'm looking at AMZN, which has a large part of its revenue in AWS (cloud services) and in retail. So what I need to know is how big is the cloud services industry, and how big is the retail industry. How big are the major player, and if available, how much market share has any one company had historically.

What happens is that we get more per-share book value in such transactions than we give up. These transactions, however, do not deliver us any immediate gain in per-share intrinsic value, because in this respect what we give and what we get are roughly equal. And, as Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I can’t tell you too often (though you may feel that we try), it’s the per-share gain in intrinsic value that counts rather than the per-share gain in book value. Though Berkshire’s intrinsic value grew very substantially in 1998, the gain fell well short of the 48.3% recorded for book value.

There is no substitute for reading reams of 10-Ks, 10-Qs, proxies, press releases, industry magazines, and blogs as well as doing your own primary research.

Vuru and Forcastix are ridiculously mechanical one trick ponies that oversimplify fundamental analysis.  By focusing only on financial statement analysis, qualitative factors like management quality, competitive forces, and industry strategy are ignored.  Additionally, other quantitative factors like unit economics and implied expectations go without mention.

Vuru's treatment of Earnings Power Value (EPV) valuation is plain wrong.  There is zero chance that INTC is 66% overvalued if EPV valuation is performed as described in [Greenwald's Value Investing: From Graham, to Buffett, and Beyond](http://www.amazon.com/Value-Investing-Graham-Buffett-Beyond/dp/0471381985).  Such a large and obvious error brings into question the assumptions they use in their mechanical DCFs.

There are plenty of resources on the sidebar that you can use to improve your valuation skills.  Professor Damodaran of NYU's valuation class is an excellent treatment of valuation for you to use if you have a semester to practice.  There are also a list of many books that will help you learn fundamental analysis as well.  You will pick up these services' mechanical errors by comparing your valuations to theirs.

For example, STAG, an industrial REIT is trading at about a 5.6% dividend yield, I'd like to know how well the stock has performed over a given time period when the stock has traded at a 5.6% yield. Or, how has the stock traded when the Price to Tangible Book was 2.8.

Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Fundamental security analysis - isn't this completely... wrong?,"First off, i'm a complete noob when it comes to doing security analysis. I watched Martin Shkrelli's MOOC on doing financial modeling. (Hey, gotta start somewhere, right?)

One thing I noticed is that when projections are made, people assume a lot of things... like X% revenue growth, fixed (or close to fixed) margins, etc etc. (Better yet,  their discount rate.) Then they do their NPV or whatever they come up with to determine the ""true"" value for them. 

Fine and dandy: except.. they're making directional stock bet on bunch of assumptions about the future from past. Ok, i am saying the obvious...

BUT.. wouldn't it be smarter create several scenarios (and permutations of them) to see where the ""most likely"" max and min based on the different parameters? Instead of using only 1 set of  parameter that you just kinda ""guess"" from looking at the past?

(I'm a data scientist.. so i'm talking about cluster analysis on returns generated from permutation of hyper parameters).

Or is this a complete waste of time?",0,"People do do scenario analysis.

What's the issue?","I doubt there's an issue with modeling different scenarios. I'd bet that most security analysts tend to just use conservative numbers and invest in companies where they're more confident that these conservative estimates will play out (stable industry, good knowledge, etc) - rather than throwing a bunch of models together to get an average.","The purpose of financial modeling is to determine the value of security under possible future states (or scenarios). 

Most analysts model three scenarios: Bull, Base, and Bear (with sufficient variation in assumptions, but holding the discount rate constant). If there are specific issues you want to test, then you test them separately (e.g. what happens to operating income - and the stock price - if organic sales declines given the company's embedded operating leverage).

Technical analysis,SecurityAnalysis,What is your favorite type of short thesis?,"IMHO I've been using accounting-related indicators of earnings management or fraud when I select companies to short. 

But I've also selected shorts based on ""Melting Ice"" theses in the past such as Coinstar or the mattress industry (doesn't always work due to buyout risk). I'm sure we've already heard the saying ""never short on valuation"", which I've learned first hand to follow.

Any other favorite reasons to short (no technical analysis)? How has those strategies worked for you overall?  

",26,"My honest answer is that short selling is so hard, the best shorts are one where you have multiple angles in the short thesis.

In my experience this is one of the worst type of shorts because the ""melting"" part of it can take forever. With shorts, the quicker they work out and less exposed you are to your cost of carry + the market ripping your face off the better. 

A critical component to shorting that most miss, and one that I learned the hard way, is the *why now.* An industry can be in secular decline, a company can have accounting problems, it can have too high a valuation, whatever, but why is this moment the time to put a short on? Getting the timing right is the hardest part. 

For example, I knew ELLI was a short this summer but never pulled the trigger b/c there just wasn't a catalyst I could see. No catalyst, plus they had balance sheet optionality to lever up and buy more stuff to jump start their slowing top-line, just made it too risky to put on. 

But anyway, my favorite type of shorts are the asymmetric type where if I'm wrong I really don't lose much money. I love shorting bonds at/near par b/c if I'm wrong I'm only out my carry. Equity shorts have to be a pretty special situation with regard to the catalyst time line just because your downside is unlimited in theory. ","I have yet to bother with shorts. If one was good, it would have three things. If someone could do all this, I don't know why they would publish it however.

1. Obviously, a compelling argument

2. Why now? We would have been wrong (according to the market) as it kept rising this long. What has changed or what could cause the market to not remain so irrational? (Shorting stupidity is.... stupid. Because if stupid activity is what caused it to bid up, then bad decisions are all it takes for it to continue to rise....)

3. What are the hedging costs? I don't want a naked short. How do I protect myself? Buy call options every month? What kind of expenses do I pay to borrow the stock for the short?"
Technical analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Analysis for Engineering Informatica: An uncovered deep value theory for a stock that has suffered from a technical overhang and negative market sentiment surrounding Italian IT firms,"Hi, I am just starting my career as a sell side analyst and I have spend the last few weeks working on the buy case for a company called Engineering Informatica Spa. This is not a finished version of my anayslis and the valuation is not included. I am calling the company tomorow to ask questions on revenue streams and cost structure to get a better idea of the sustainability or margins. Please let me know where the anayliss could be improved and what you think of it, taking into account this is my first ever write up. 


A company with high and improving returns on tangible capital (17.2% 2013 to 21.8% 2014), driven by increasing Earnings margins and decreasing capital requirements, is trading at distressed multiples, 5.8x 2014 Ev/Ebit due to market pressure and a technical overhang. The Engineering investment case is becoming a very attractive deep value trade with potential upsides of 50% and low risks. 
  
Background and Sector specifics

Engineering is a major Italian information technology group which provides services such as software solutions, IT infrastructure, and business expertise on a global level (although 85% of its revenues are still derived in Italy). The group is organized around four main market divisions: PA (government) and Healthcare (31.7%), Utilities and Telco (28.9%), Industries & Services (22.2%), and Finance (17.3%). The company has a market cap of 520m euros, employs over 7,200 employees and achieved revenues of 823m in 2013(6.9% YoY growth) a 6.6% EBIT margin.
 
 
ENG has 3 main revenue streams: System Integration & Consulting, Outsourcing, and Proprietary licences and fees.

System Integration & Consulting

Characterised by contracts lasting less than one year, focus on providing IT services on enterprise content management (content, workflow and knowledge management). They also consult in areas such as organisation governance and people management. These areas of revenue offer higher profitability compared to outsourcing contracts due to the higher value of service provided and the nature of the price structure (turn-key contracts).

Outsourcing, Application Management, and Cloud Services		
Managed Operations Department provides clients with a full offering of Outsourcing Services thanks to a highly Technological Centre located in Pont Saint Martin. IT infrastructure is also based on Torino, Padua, Milan, Vicenza and Rome sites. Despite lower profitability in this area, outsourcing guarantees more visibility thanks to longer contracts (5-7 years) and c80% of contract value is made of a fixed amount. Outsourcing is anti-cyclical: in economic downturns and firms need to further improve their cost structure, they prefer to outsource IT services or computerize manual processes. 

Proprietary licences and fees 

ENG can rely on more than 200 proprietary solutions spanning from a CRM suite for utilities to compliance and governance software for banks. The offer of proprietary software is characterized by high profitability and strong customer retention (high barrier to entry depending on whether the software is recognised as market leader).
 
The market ENG operates in is concentrated around 5 players (IBM, Accenture, HP, Microsoft, Engineering) counting for a combined market share of nearly 42%. It is important to note that in an economic downturn firms tend to cut IT spending first. Thus, the Italian ICT market has seen a reduction in consumer spending since 2007. However after 7 years of market decline, Assinform forecasts an increase in overall spending by 0.6% in 2014.  Engineering claims that it has benefited from sector decline as it grabbed a larger relevant market share, up around 300bps to 11.5%.
ENG is a services company, 91% of its costs are made up of Personnel costs and the cost paid to 3rd party suppliers. Due to the heavy variable cost structure, the ability to improve margins is mostly derived through increasing labour productivity and efficiency, as well as reducing prices paid to suppliers. The business is also slightly seasonal; the first half of the year consists of around 48% of revenues. Typically, increases/decreases in spending see a delay of 6/12 months to GDP changes due to the nature and length of an IT project.

The Opportunity

Negative market sentiment in Europe seems to have influenced ENG’s price:  since its peak in April €54 the stock has dropped by 31% to €37, trading at 10.6x 2014 P/E. Yet the company fundamentals have stayed consistent over this period. Q1 results were weak (Ebit down 20% yoy to €10m) and the price drop might have reflected this. However, these results were in line with management expectations, taking into consideration the integration process of the company Engineering.mo (ex T-Systems Italia) and the consolidation of the newly-acquired company MHT. We can safely say there were no fundamental issues. In the meantime we have seen a recovery of margins, top line growth and a positive net financial position. Results in H1 are reflective of a solid business with potential to benefit from international expansion, or a share buyback with the cash that has been generated. Top line growth was 3% yoy, Ebit grew 7.6% to €33.9m and Ebit margins also improved by 50bps to 8.6%. Improvements in Public Administration payment times led to an increase in the net financial position by 15.9% to €45.2m.
Engineering stock is artificially depressed: On top of the overbearing market forces, we are expecting Bestinver to sell its 10% stake in Engineering after the departure of Francisco Garcia Parames as fund manager. Bestinver is facing 5billion euros in redutions to its AUM and will most likely begin to sell off its positions to liquidate. Market reaction to this news has led to further de-rating of the stock as people anticipate the selloff.  

Margins: Are they sustainable?

Given its capital returns (21.8%), operating history (12.3% CAGR 2000-2013) and international growth prospects, Engineering’s current valuation is only justifiable if (1) margins begin to fall off or (2) large amounts of receivables are written off. In the first case we would be looking at future increases in costs and/or severe deflation in the prices clients pay for the services ENG provides. This would also suggest ENG loses pricing power in its market. Second, Engineering holds a large amount of receivables on its books (€552m as of H1 2014). The risk here is that clients default on the debt owed and Engineering is forced to write off large proportions of its balance sheet. In this section we will explain why these 2 main risks are not significant enough to make up for the recent movements in the stock price. 


Trade Receivables risk

At face value the Trade Receivables situation that Engineering is facing does not look good. I would definitely consider this the biggest risk the company faces in the next 2-3 years. The Group claims that the type of operations justifies the high amount of receivables, such as the proportion due from the public administration, contractual durations. Trade receivables are all due within 12 months. However, the biggest issue here is the amount of receivables that are overdue. These have increased by 37.6% to €265m. Moreover, almost 30% of receivables are overdue by 120 days meaning the debtor hasn’t paid in 16 months. Yet most of the increase in overdue receivables has come from doing business with the Italian government. The Group has indicated that government bodies often do not respect the conditions established by contracts, but this does not result in irrecoverable receivables. In other words, even though the government is extremely slow at paying Engineering, they do not expect the debt to be defaulted.
The problem of overdue receivables is reflected in the dispute with the Region of Sicily over almost €100m, which has been ongoing for over 2 years.  After speaking to management about the problem they have emphasised that they are confident they will be paid. Their auditors are not in the condition to ask Engineering to write off the credit, implying a high grade of confidence in getting payment back. Another notable positive: there are expected future improvements to payments terms from Public Administration due to the European Late Payment Directive; imposing members of the EU to pay their private suppliers within 60 days. These changes would lead to further cash flow improvements.

Benefits from a positive NFP

Since ENG is cash positive (45.2m, 16% yoy increase) the options for share buy backs, increase in dividends and also growth through international acquisitions are all likely. In 2014 we are expecting a 7.6 cents dividend payout, which has increased from 6.5 cents in 2013. In addition, management has clearly mentioned that “we are plainly aware of the under-evaluation of our company meaning we can invest some of our cash in buying back shares”. The half year report has confirmed that the shareholders have voted in favour of a share repurchase plan for a maximum of 2.5m shares, within a maximum time frame of 18 months.  Engineering has 12.5m outstanding shares, so the share buyback policy could lead to 20% of shares being repurchased. This is a highly significant figure, and it is great news to know the company is this confident that the shares are undervalued. Once the company begins to repurchase shares, this should further restore market confidence. The belief that the stock is undervalued is certainly prevalent within the company. Chairman Michele Cinaglia has recently engaged in buying over €800,000 of shares over the months of August and September using his personal wealth. 
Management says they are evaluating investments abroad, which so far have proved to be the strongest sources of growth, and are convinced that geographical expansion will be one of the key points of success.
",6,"That is a solid first draft. You probably are 40% of the way there. Here are the issues on a macro level:

1. You need to get a breakdown of revenue and profitability by business type. How much of the business is out-sourcing vs licensing vs IT integration.

2. I think you're missing a section on margins, you talk about it but there isn't much there. How sustainable do you think they are?

3. Those trade receivables are a concern. You'd need to get a better feel for which lines of business and what sectors they are against. Assuming it is against revenue sectors (big assumption) then the EU directive only helps with ~30% of it. 

4. You're missing a discussion on debt. What is their interest coverage? Is their debt floating or fixed? How is their liquidity.

5. Given their debt profile, how do they expect to implement their buyback? 20% buyback of a $500m company = $100m, with only 50m in the bank. Re-run your numbers on their debt profile post such a buy back. 

6. What is their capex:sales ratio? How does this compare against their competitors? (probably should be linked to the debt discussion). What does this say about their growth profile?

4. Some of the statements you make are contradictory. 

>However after 7 years of market decline, Assinform forecasts an increase in overall spending by 0.6% in 2014

So really, spend has stabilized. Also, how big has the decline in spend over the last seven years? Also;

Based on the fact that revenues have fallen dramatically last two years and industry themes, the fact that Q4 2020 was awful due to COVID, and the heightened recession fears, I am thinking of revenue losses of 20% and above this year. 

If such a scenario came to be, at current gross margins, BO would need to raise more equity before the end of the fiscal year. As of May 31, net working capital was only 2 million, and they recently raised another 409 million. So if gross margins are held constant, growth is -20%, and SGA are held constant, I calculated that they would end the year with only 100 million in cash and thus need to raise more. They can cut marketing spend and continue to deplete inventories, but I don't think that's a successful long-term strategy. 

Overall I think BO is in a very precarious situation. If COVID worsens (disrupts their supply chains in any way or continues store closures) or we do enter a recession I think it will be disastrous.

A site with really good charting functionality and technical analysis capabilities, but one that is able to chart and get info about stocks that are listed only in that country's exchange? (since only a few equities from foreign markets are have ADRs or are listed in u.s. exchanges.

stockcharts seems to be able to only show equities listed in the American exchanges. (unless I'm mistaken)",4,,,
Technical analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Restructuring Resources?,"Hi All,
Given that this has been of great help to me when I needed Value Investing resources, I wanted to know if anybody has any Restructuring resources? Any models? Training courses? Case studies? I looked into Distressed Debt Analysis but I am looking for resources geared towards technical learning.


Thank you!",5,"I would suggest following a big bankruptcy that has already published a ""plan of reorganization"" and a ""disclosure statement"". The disc statement is like a prospectus for a company emerging from bankruptcy. It tells you how all the creditor classes are to be treated. The ""plan"" is the legal doc laying out that framework. The DS will have the history and is actually a very readable doc. 

Here's the avaya one.

You can find the bankruptcy docket for all major bankruptcies on a site like primeclerk. 

Please note that just because a plan and DS are filed, doesn't mean that those will be the final plan & DS approved by the court. 

But they're a good place to start. 

Anyway, just a suggestion. I personally think jumping in the weeds with some skin in the game is always the best way to learn.

&#x200B;

*Will the FED raise interest rates in December?*

Yes.  Too telegraphed and locked in not to, but next year is more of a crap shoot given recent FOMC quasi-dovishness.

&#x200B;

*Is housing data an important leading indicator?*

Yes, especially orders but it is still unclear whether the current order slowdown is due to a rate bump or other factors.  Formations and overall starts still way below long term trends.  A bump in the cancellation rate along with an order slowdown will signal bad things.  I don't think that will happen though.

&#x200B;

*Which companies do you think have important quarterly results coming up?*

GE as they're just such a big debt issuer and we'll get an update on the long term care debacle.   It is still incredible to me that the Kansas Dept of Insurance waived statutory accounting rules so GE could stair-step its $15B reserve bump.  Why would a known major financial liability NOT appear on a balance sheet??!!?!  Another thing nobody talks about....the big pension hole they have (\~$30 billion).  Where the heck is that money going to come from as they have boomers retiring and being laid off?

&#x200B;

*Which secular trend do you believe is at an inflection point?*

Quite a few...loosening debt covenants, absence of inflation/wage growth, low-forever corporate spreads...

&#x200B;

*Do you think that M&A is going to increase or decrease in the near future?*

Decrease since debt costs are higher

&#x200B;

*New accounting or tax rules you think are interesting?*

There's a silly rule this year that puts equity unrealized gains and losses through net income instead of comprehensive for some companies.  Why?  And why not also include debt unrealized G/L?  This just makes it harder to analyze financials and has no clear purpose.

&#x200B;

*And any other interesting trends, data, or analysis you'd like to share*

QE tapering (or ""QT) is a major theme.  U.S. well into it, Europe beginning it and trailing US by 2-3 yrs, and Japan needs to fix its upside down population stack with immigration before anything can be done there.  As Europe QTs the dollar could weaken since debt yields would be closer to US debt yields.

Market trends,SecurityAnalysis,"The markets this week were hit hard with headlines on the tariffs/trade war, and perhaps interest rate trends. Banks were among the hardest hit. Thoughts on why?","It is clear that tariffs can directly impact the microeconomics of many industrials or consumer products companies. However, the selloff seemed to be broader and more dramatic to be attributed to trade issues alone, from my perspective. 



A few noteworthy things that happened this week:

*the fed increased the fed funds rate another 25 bp

*the long term yields sharply peaked on Wednesday, yet fell and/or stabilized Thurs/Fri

*$BAC, JPM, WFC, BK were each down 7-9% this week and were hit hard on Friday

*DOW and S&P were down around 5-5.5%

*$BK, which has had very little press coverage, was sold off particularly hard on Thurs/Fri. (one of my bigger holdings and I thought the valuation was already modest)




Any thoughts on why the banks have been taking such a shellacking when they are probably the least impacted by trade treaties and while interest rates have unsurprisingly continued their upward trend?



Is it the manifestation of larger macroeconomic factors and uncertainties (e.g., GDP growth)? if so, I can't seem to tell what those would be..

edit: formatting",11,"One of the notable issues not listed from this week was the ""techlash"" in the wake of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. There are real fears that business models that rely primarily on monetizing user data (see Google, Facebook), may take a hit due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the #DeleteFacebook movement. Also, European regulatory scrutiny of US tech champions is getting increasing news coverage - latest talks are that the EU is hoping to tax 3% of tech firms' gross revenues claiming that companies like FB and GOOG have been too savvy at dodging local taxes. While this mostly affects Nasdaq, I think that seeing any of the 'market champions' like FB/GOOG/AMZN get hit hard also hurts confidence. 

Another thing potentially impacting markets is the new $1.3trn spending bill signed this week in the US. With the economy almost at full steam, conventional theory goes that fiscal spending could lead to economy overheating, which may force Fed's hand to raise rates faster than anticipated. It also probably doesn't help that the bill was signed very hastily, narrowly averting a government shutdown, which some think highlights a growing governance crisis in the US. 

But really, it's the fears of trade war that matter. China took a hardline stance that they will respond swiftly and decisively to tariffs, and their threat needs to be credible - no chance they will let US bully them. A trade war is bad for stocks.

Market trends,SecurityAnalysis,Investment opportunities in tech companies who adopt this go-to-market strategy,"Hi,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.

# Bottom-Up Software Sales

The ""bottom up"" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.

The premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.

For example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.

There are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.

# What's so special about bottom-up?

There are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.

&#x200B;

* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.
* **More money for R&D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  
   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....
* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.
* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.

## What to look for in a bottom-up company

Not all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

* **Look for a ""receptive"" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.
* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.
* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.
* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.
* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.

## Bottom-Up Companies

Below are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).

### Asana ($ASAN):

Asana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.

I like Asana for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.
2. **R&D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.
3. **Product & design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.
4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.

### Slack ($WORK) :

Slack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.

I like Slack for a couple of reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.
2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottom-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.
3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottom-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.

### Honourable Mentions:

Below are some more bottom-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.

&#x200B;

1. Zoom ($ZM)
2. Atlassian ($TEAM)
3. Datadog ($DDOG)
4. Zendesk ($ZEN)
5. Hubspot ($HUBS)
6. Docusign ($DOCU)

**Abstract** 

Systemic risk in the banking sector is usually associated with long periods of economic downturn and very large social costs. On one hand, shocks coming from correlated exposures towards the real economy may induce correlation in banks’ default probabilities thereby increasing the likelihood for systemic-tail events like the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. On the other hand, financial contagion also plays an important role in generating large-scale market failures, amplifying the initial shocks coming from the real economy. To study the sources of these rare phenomena, we propose a new definition of systemic risk (i.e. the probability of a large number of banks going into distress simultaneously) and thus we develop a multilayer microstructural model to study empirically the determinants of systemic risk. The model is then calibrated on the most comprehensive granular dataset for the euro area banking sector, capturing roughly 96% or EUR 23.2 trillion of euro area banks’ total assets over the period 2014-2018. The output of the model decompose and quantify the sources of systemic risk showing that correlated economic shocks, financial contagion mechanisms, and their interaction are the main sources of systemic events. The results obtained with the simulation engine resemble common market-based systemic risk indicators and empirically corroborate findings from existing literature. This framework gives regulators and central bankers a tool to study systemic risk and its developments, pointing out that systemic events and banks’ idiosyncratic defaults have different drivers, hence implying different policy responses.",36,,,
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,Impact of lower oil prices on the stock market?,"Can someone please explain to me why the lower oil prices is causing a panic in the market? I know that crude oil prices are seen as a leading indicator of the economic health but this crash in price is due to a supply side shock. Were prices trending downward prior to this due to virus? (Factories closed and reduced air travel). Shouldnt the price decrease actually benefit consumers since they can spend the money and help improve sales? 

What companies apart from energy firms will be most affected by this?

TLDR: Can someone please explain why low oil prices is causing a market panic? Thanks.",42,"This is a good question. I don't know the exact answer but since it was so steep and unexpected, this will cause companies to declare bankruptcy which will hurt lenders and investors. There's a difference between lower oil prices such that oil companies stay in business, lenders lend less and investors invest less such that overall oil companies earn less profit vs. such low prices so fast where oil companies declare bankruptcy, people lose their jobs, financial service companies have tons of write-offs with some boutique ones also declare bankruptcy etc... This has much more significantly bad impacts in the short-term and it takes more time before the benefits of lower oil prices are realized. If this proves just a temporary measure which causes many US oil companies to go out of business then the Saudis raise the price back up to $60/barrel that overall would have a negative impact on the US economy not a positive one which could be priced in right now since that is many people's expectations.","Low oil prices benefit some industries (e.g., those who use crude as a major raw material).

On the flip side, it also has negative implications for many others: oil companies (integrated/up/mid/downstream), oilfield service companies (e.g. Schlumberger) or any others in the value chain (e.g. logistics), US shale (currently highly levered), industrial companies who manufacture equipment or supply materials to build and operate oilfield operations, staffing companies, and financial companies. As people get laid off, this could have an unfavorable domino impact on consumer companies as well.","Debt crisis risk. Low oil prices always lead to waves of bankruptcies in the oil & gas sector.

So far, the one major silver lining in the whole coronavirus / stock market crash / global freakout has been that the banks have looked rock solid.

Related to banks but not oil: One of the last half-meaningful indicators left that isn't screaming ""this is 2007 all over again"" is the TED spread, you don't want to see anything that might fiddle with that switch. Even if you're not a big believer in the continuing value of the TED spread, you don't want to see it jump.

It has ticked up, but only above its ludicrously low levels. So far so good, there.

To be clear, if the market dips below 23,000, we're talking about a crisis as bad as the combined effects of .COM/9-11.

After that, your only remaining sane analog for a worsening situation is the 2007 financial crisis (that would send the market to 13,000 or 14,000). After that, you're talking Black Monday (beyond unlikely, but that would send the market well below 5,000).

There just isn't a lot of room left for this thing to crash before the whole system goes dead. However, expect the market to fight brutally for every inch of ground between 21,000 and 25,000. VIX gonna be crazy.

The only remaining question is: is everyone just fleeing to cash? Looking at things like Bitcoin, it seems like the answer may be yes because there is some crazy stuff happening that goes beyond even what you'd expect in a full-on panic/massacre.

I think I mentioned on this sub last week that I think this is .COM/9-11 bad, not 2007 bad. I still stand by that. If so, you want to see the market put up a fight to stay above 23,000. If the close today is any indicator, that's what's happening.

What's happening right now, though, is everyone is sort of asking each other, ""Is this 2007 bad?"" In the absence of a good answer, folks are trying to let someone else hold the bag."
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,The Fall of the US Banking Sector,"Over the last 20 years we have noticed interest rates have been much lower than the previous 20 years, reaching new lows after each cycle. Accommodative monetary policies have become the standard tool to jumpstart economies after each downturn. This is no different in 2020 as we feel the effects of COVID-19 where long term interest rates have again fallen to the same levels as those experienced in the GFC. Low interest rates usually stimulate the financial equities markets by increasing spending and credit, lowering the discount rate and making the higher returns provided by equities more attractive. However, do we see the same effects in the banking sector which has a unique and more direct relationship with interest rates?

Interest rates in Japan and Europe have been at or below zero for the last decade which has also coincided with significant downwards pressure in the stock price of each regions banking sector. I want to investigate the validity of a causal effect in this relationship and how it may affect US banks in the next decade as the US heads back towards the zero lower bound and potential negative rate territory.

**Banking Sector Performance in a Low Interest Rate Environment**

Following the global financial crisis all three bank indices in the US, Japan and Euro area saw their prices drop more than 60% (see Fig. 1). Banks in Japan and the Euro area never saw their prices make meaningful recoveries since in the backdrop of zero to negative interest rates. However, banks in the US recovered to their 2007 highs in the backdrop of increasing interest rates. 

[Figure 1: Central Bank Interest Rates and Performance of Bank Indices Over 20 Years](https://imgur.com/Cu3fCE6)


An argument could be made that this could simply be a reflection of the US stock market having had one of the best bull markets this last decade whilst both Japan and Euro stock markets have struggled. The counter argument is that although the US bank index (KBW) has largely tracked the US market index (SPY) both the Japan and Euro bank indices (TOPIX and SX7E) have de-coupled from their respective market indices (Nikkei and EURO Stoxx 50). Both the Nikkei and EURO Stoxx 50 have largely recovered their losses from the GFC but again the banks in either region have not. 

[Figure 2: Performance of Bank and Market Indices in Japan, the Euro Area and the US](https://imgur.com/G263RPz)

Another argument one could make is that the difference in price growth could be due to a result of the proliferation of share buybacks that has occurred in the US stock market compared to that of Japan and the Euro area. Banks also usually yield high dividends which are not reflected in the chart in Fig. 1. I don’t have the data to explore the impact of share buybacks and dividends further, but I assume the significant divergence in the indices are little explained by share buybacks and dividends alone.  

For the same trends we see in Japan and Europe to hold true in the US an assumption must be made that the Federal Reserve (FED) will hold interest rates near or potentially even below zero for a significant period. I believe there is a high probability that this will be the case as we saw in 2018 tightening monetary policy resulted in fear in the financial markets. It will become ever more difficult for reserve banks to unwind reserve assets and pull back from accommodative policies as low interest rates become the framework on which the new economy is built on. 

**Interest Rate Effects on Bank Profitability**

First, I want to examine the effect of reserve bank interest rate policies on bank profitability. The impact that interest rate changes will have will depend on a range of variables such as the banks asset and debt portfolio, the maturity gap between its assets and liabilities and non-interest portion of income (such as fee income for products and services). 

The effect of lower interest rates on profitability come directly from the level of rates and the yield curve. The effect of the level of interest rates can be summarized as follows:

* Banks partially fund their operations with retail deposit at rates set as a markdown on market rates. This markdown is compressed as interest rates decrease because the deposit rate cannot fall below zero. Therefore, as interest rates decrease, the net interest rate margin on banks also decreases. 

* Lower interest rates will generally induce more lending and investments in riskier assets in search for higher returns. This is the whole point of accommodative monetary policy (low interest rates) and may increase net interest rate margins. However, this depends on economic conditions as a weak economic outlook (precisely the reason why rates may be low) can limit demand for loans. 

The effect of the yield curve is explained by the operation of banks taking short-term loans and granting longer term loans. Therefore, net interest rate margins are compressed when the yield curve flattens and increased when the yield curve steepens.

If we examine the net interest rate margin of banks in all three regions, we see an overall downtrend, in-line with that of central bank interest rate policies (see Fig. 3). The net interest rate margin is lowest (Japan) for the region with the lowest average interest rate over the last 20 years and vice versa (US). The average net interest rate income growth follows the same trend, where the growth is lowest (Japan) for the region with the lowest average interest rate over the last 20 years and vice versa (US). 

[Figure 3: Interest Margins and Net Interest Income Performance over the Last 20 Years](https://imgur.com/qa6tGk2)

In all three regions, despite a low interest rate environment, the average net interest income portion of total income remains steady (except for the period following the GFC). Banks have seemingly not been able to supplement the loss in net interest margin with non-interest income through this period. 

In conclusion there will likely be downwards pressure on the income and share price of bank stocks in the US in the next cycle. I don’t believe we will see the same catastrophic failure of the banking sector like we saw in the GFC. Banks are extremely well capitalized with healthy liquidity and stable funding rates following the GFC and resulting stringent regulations through Basel III. Liquidity issues have been further dampened by the FED initiating ‘infinite QE’ and buying up seemingly every type of asset save for equities.",89,"Banks can supplement the loss of interest income domestically by expanding to EM countries. You see that with European and Japanese banks. 

What we will see in the US is further M&A activity. We have roughly 5500 banks currently, I expect roughly 2k left by the next decade. Credit Unions dont pay taxes and will continue to gain market share.

If you want a real short play on banks, look at the big 4 in Australia. Their NIMs are getting crushed and wont recover. Their regulators are also a lot more friendly towards fintech banks.","There are plenty of cases studies with banks being profitable with negative interest rates in Europe (BNP, CS, Santander, UBS, Intesa, etc.). Turns out, banks just need to charge higher rates (I.e., less negative) than whatever the underlying interest rates are to be profitable.","Why is Berkshire long banks then?
What if interest rates rise dramatically?"
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,Air Wisconsin (OTC: HRBR) – The Undiscovered Airline IPO,"**Summary**

Harbor Diversified (OTC: HRBR) is one of the strongest risk-reward opportunities on the market today. Harbor diversified is a non-operating entity that owns Air Wisconsin – a U.S. domestic regional airline that remains undiscovered and undervalued by the market. A 400% upside to the current share price of $1.84 is easily achievable based on the company’s existing economics being fully understood and realized by the market.

**Mispricing**

* This opportunity exists because of the dynamics surrounding how this security became publicly traded and the fact that it is an illiquid micro-cap security trading on OTC markets.
* Air Wisconsin (AirWis) became Harbor Diversified, Inc. via a merger in 2011 with Harbor Biosciences, a cash-burning pharma business with substantial NOLs and deferred tax assets for the profitable AirWis to take advantage of.
* HRBR went dark and ceased to publish filings with the SEC, leaving investors unaware of the merger. Nine years later, an investor Travis Martin learned of this merger and filed a lawsuit demanding that HRBR release financials, as they had >300 shareholders.
* Consequently, HRBR released its 2019 10-K in July 2020, revealing an **undiscovered airline IPO** that lacked the fanfare and marketing of a traditional IPO process.
* Over the past few months, we have learned about the company in bits and pieces via quarterly filings, with the 2020 10-K being released on April 1, 2021. **Given these facts, AirWis trades at 1.2x 2020 EBITDAR, 0.5x 2020 revenue, 3.3x 2020 earnings, 0.7x year-end 2020 book value, and generates a 61% free cash flow yield.**

**Business**

* HRBR is a holding company that now consists solely of AirWis and the NOLs of the pharma business ($19.1 million of DTAs); the remainder of the pharma business was liquidated.
* It owns 64 CRJ-200 aircrafts and flew four million passengers annually pre-pandemic.
* The company operates under a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) with United Airlines (UAL), in which AirWis serves as a United Express regional carrier.
* AirWis operates routes to 36 cities across the US, all of which depart from or arrive at two UAL hubs: Chicago O’Hare and Washington Dulles.
* Market cap of $100 million and generated $185.9 million of revenue in 2020 at a 23.3% EBIT margin and a 41.6% EBITDAR margin.
* $76.9 million of net cash and trades at **0.5x today’s book value**. AirWis generated $1.11 in FCF per share in 2020.
* Trades at 1.2x 2020 EBITDAR, **0.5x 2020 revenue**, 2.5x 2020 earnings, 0.7x year-end 2020 book value, and generates a 61% free cash flow yield.

**Industry**

* Regional airlines provide aircraft, fleet maintenance, and crew; the larger airlines pay for fuel and aircraft insurance, sell tickets, and plan routes. A typical contract compensates the regional airline on the basis of operating statistics such as number of departures, timeliness, customer satisfaction, and available seat miles (ASM).
* Regional airline industry relies primarily on leisure travel. This industry will benefit immensely upon the economy reopening, with pent-up leisure travel demand serving as a tailwind for the latter half of 2021 into early 2022.
* Air Wisconsin strategically anticipated this by announcing 5 new routes departing from Milwaukee: to Charleston, South Carolina; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; Portland, Maine and Savannah, Georgia.

**AirWis has strong unit economics because of the UAL contract**

* On an ASM basis, AirWis earns $90 in EBITDAR per ASM, compared with \~$20 for regional CPA peers Skywest Airlines and Mesa Airlines.
* In October 2020, AirWis’s contract with UAL was renegotiated and incentive-based components were suspended, tying the economics of the contract entirely to the operating statistics plus a fixed payment, regardless of flight volumes.
* The contract provides an extension until February 2023, with two renewal options to 2025 and to 2027. Pre-contract renewal, AirWis earned $35 per ASM, compared to \~$20 for peers. **It is clear that AirWis had superior contract economics before the pandemic and obtained even better terms with UAL during the pandemic.**
* AirWis saw more favorable EBITDAR margins with an astonishing 41.6%, far outpacing Mesa’s 13.1% and Skywest’s 11.2%.
* AirWis’s contract economics are stronger than peers because of the history between the two companies and the flight route economics. AirWis has been flying as a United Express carrier since the early 1980s and pioneered the concept of codesharing as a regional air carrier. Their relationship with United is far more entrenched than Skywest’s, who started serving UAL in the early 2000s, and Mesa’s, who started serving UAL in the late 1990s.
* Furthermore, AirWis’s flight routes out of IAD operate at near monopoly status with greater passenger density, given that United is the only airline with a hub at Dulles (comparatively, Mesa and Skywest operate primarily out of more “crowded” hubs, e.g. LAX, where UAL, DAL, and AAL all share a hub). AirWis’s routes out of IAD have shorter distances comparatively, yet still command price premiums given the monopolized status of these routes. **Thus, given the long and favorable history of service between UAL and AirWis, and the fact that the routes AirWis serves operate as monopolies with high passenger density, AirWis has been able to achieve superior contract economics than peers.**

**Government support has provided substantial cash**

* AirWis received a total of $42 million from the US government in 2020 from the CARES Act PSP1 and another $10 million from the PPP loan.
* This year’s strong earnings, largely driven by government support and reduction of lease expense, enabled AirWis to increase its cash balance from $69 million to $130 million during 2020 without raising any debt aside from the PPP loan.
* AirWis will receive a further $60.1 million in 2021 from the US government through PSP2 and PSP3, according to the US Treasury. With this government support, AirWis will earn 1.0x its market cap in net income this year.
* AirWis is extremely unlevered compared to peers, sitting at a net debt/EBITDAR of (1.0x) compared to peers Mesa and Skywest with 5.0x and 8.8x, respectively.
* As of the announcement of PSP2 and PSP3, **AirWis has $72.9 million of net cash (incl. leases).** **This towering net cash balance will create the opportunity for AirWis management to deliver cash back to shareholders via a special dividend or share repurchases**.

**AirWis will become profitable on a normalized basis due to lease purchases**

* In 2021, earnings will be stronger than in 2020, but these numbers are not indicative of AirWis’s future earnings power due to the enormous amount of impending government support.
* On a normalized basis, using 2019 flight volumes, AirWis will generate $20 million in annual unlevered net income, for a \~8% net income margin. This margin improvement is substantial over pre-pandemic levels, which were razor thin when factoring in one-time add-backs. The improvement is purely driven by the elimination of $40 million in annual rent expense with an incremental step-up in depreciation. **This move by management was clearly margin-accretive for the business; normalized earnings will be profitable.**

**Valuation – Book Value Approach**

* Year-end 2020, AirWis had $2.12 of book value per share. For today’s book value, we add back current and long-term deferred revenue ($43.2m), which will come in as earnings in 2021. We also add back the $10m PPP loan, which is forgivable. We arrive at an adjusted book value of $3.09 per share. On top of this, AirWis will receive $60.1 million from PSP2 and PSP3 to offset payroll in 2021. Adjusting for PSP2 and PSP3, we arrive at our base case of $4.19 per share.
* Furthermore, pre-owned CRJ-200s sell for $1.3 million. Even if HRBR were to liquidate, selling the 64 aircraft at 75% of the market price would generate enough cash to cover the market cap. Adding in the $76.9 million of net cash would yield a share price of $2.51.

**Valuation – Earnings Power Approach**

* At normalized net income of $20 million, applying a 10x multiple and assuming a dollar-for-dollar conversion of $76.9 million in net cash, we arrive at a $5.84 share price.
* At 14x, we obtain a $7.30 share price.
* **The discrepancy in price and value for this business is too large to ignore.**

**Catalysts**

* The primary catalyst for a rerating is capital allocation. The majority shareholder in the business is Richard Bartlett, who controls 26% of shares outstanding.
* Inside ownership is 36%, demonstrating strong alignment of incentives. Management has chosen to stay in the dark for 9 years, but after posting strong financial results and attracting substantial investor interest, they cannot remain in the shadows.
* Management has announced a share buyback program, where they will set aside an additional $1 million each month to repurchase shares. \~$13 million, an astounding 20% of market cap, has already been set aside for the program.
* While shares have yet to be repurchased, management is creating a war chest whose value will soon be unlocked by shareholders. Another capital allocation-related catalyst would be the announcement of a special dividend.
* **With $76.9 million in net cash and a $65 million market cap, simple capital allocation decisions surrounding a dividend or repurchases would prove to be imminent and tangible catalysts, prompting a proper multiple rerating.**
* The “call option” catalyst is an uplisting to a major stock exchange from their current OTC existence.
* An additional catalyst is the release of the next quarterly filing. The disclosure of $60.1 million of government funding from PSP 2&3 causing net cash balance to explode from $6.8 million year-end 2020 to $76.9 million today will be an eye-opening result to investors.

**Conclusion**

HRBR is worth base case $5.84 and bull case $7.30. The share price will increase as a result of upcoming earnings announcements, which will point out the fact that the business received a $61m check in cold hard cash from the government earlier in 2021. Dividends and share buybacks will provide further upside potential. Overall, Air Wisconsin provides one of the strongest risk-reward opportunities in the market today, with a substantial margin of safety with downside protection.

*Disclaimer: Nothing contained in this post should be construed as investment advice.*",64,"I'm intrigued but I hate the upside being ""people don't know about it yet."" It can fly under the radar perpetually","“An additional catalyst is the release of the next quarterly filing.

You have no idea how much cash they’ll report having on the books when they file. Further, net cash balance is pretty meaningless. 

This thing reads like a creative writing piece.","It feels like this is being pumped.

I wish people would post their DD and avoid using words like ""astonishing"" etc. I don't need you to qualify your case with hyperbolic words. If the case is good, it will present it self.

Also, I don't need to be told something is ""too large to ignore"". Why don't you let me be the judge of whether I should ignore it or not.

If the business is undervalued and profitable, you want people to ignore it so you can build up a big position. Stock prices follow earnings in the long term. If I had to wait 4 years for the market to figure it out, I'm fine. Edit: you say they'll do buybacks so this means you want the share price undervalued while they are buying it back. Last thing you want is the company doing buybacks on over priced shares.

I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say that the DD seems well thought out, but there is too much salesmanship.

Best of luck with it."
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,Building more sophisticated financial models and understanding operating leverage,"Hi everyone. First time poster here. Would love to hear the community's thoughts on how they create more useful financial models. Specifically, how do you look at fixed vs variable cost breakdowns to estimate incremental margins? And how do you estimate EBITDA or EBIT break-even points? It's very nice when EBITDA break-evens and/or contribution margins are laid out in IR presentations and the like, but that's the exception and not the norm.

I'm a big fan of avoiding precision bias, so I'll usually focus on more qualitative factors than the typical trend extrapolation that dominates a lot of investment analysis. I see quite a few analysts setting SG&A to an average percentage of sales over the last 3 - 5 years and then adding small incremental improvements per year without a strong grounding in the unit economics of the business, and this seems like lunacy to me. But qualitative factors don't matter much without a quantitative framework - for example, knowing that there's a lot of excess capacity is great, but it's most helpful if I can understand it in the context of what incremental margins look like.

I sometimes try extrapolating EBIT growth divided by revenue growth to get a sense for operating leverage, but it's a very Rube Goldberg way of doing things and not necessarily indicative of what's going to happen going forward. Another way is looking at competitors with lower relative cost structures and estimating that the target improves over a number of years to hit that target, but this option isn't always useful or even available (sometimes there's no applicable competitor/peer group). I'll also compare quarter-over-quarter increases of EBIT and revenue and can get a sense for incremental EBIT margin that way. This last way seems like the best way to me, but there's usually so much noise that it's not frequently accurate.

Anyone else have a good way for quantifying this sort of marginal analysis?",12,"Hola amigo. An approach I like to take is examining margins in the past 5-8 years and observing where last years was with respect to different statistics (max, min, median, etc.). From here, I observe the amount of time between last years (or LTM) performance with respect to each of the aforementioned. 

For example, I examine HypotheticalCo LTM @ 9/30/2015. I examine GM (+ COGS components; eg, rent, inventory), SG&A % revenue, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin, etc and see where each cost item is relative to the *most* (max) the company has paid for each expense item. If HypoCo is at its lowest expense structure during the LTM with respect to the last 8 years for lets say...SG&A, i can assume that I probably can't assume much margin expansion in forward projections (or utilize this perspective w/ respect to base case, bear case, bull case)

If I'm quickly modeling a company, I'd set base case margins ~ median of last 8 years (or 5, or 3); bull case to 75th percentile, bear case to min and extrapolate potential projections & create a quick and dirty future share price analysis on the basis of those outputs (can be helpful too examining vs. historical valuations; ev/ebit, p/e). Or, another approach is interpolating margins to the aforementioned median/max/min in 3-5 years.","Okay actually another question is how the hell do you guys do gross margin? 

Like I think that is the scariest/most volatile margin out of the whole latter, especially in certain industries (DRAM/Micron comes to mind). Is there even close to a single way that makes sense to make meaningful assumptions based on unit economics? ",You can't time the market.
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,Booking Holdings (BKNG) appears susceptible to short-term downside. Hoping for feedback,"Hi r/SecurityAnalysis , big fan of the informative content on this sub. I hope to ""learn by doing"", presenting my findings on Booking Holdings, Inc. (BKNG). I hope y'all find this informative and valuable, and look forward to a good discussion in the comments. Further, any feedback would be really appreciated!😃 See my write-up below:

# BKNG: Optimistic valuation side-steps possible travel recovery mishaps.

**A QUICK HISTORY**

Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) has been a fantastic investment as globe-trotting travel becomes an accessible lifestyle. $1,000 invested in 2010 would have become $9,170 by the decade’s end. In the wake of the Great Recession, individuals’ buying power has exploded thanks to online platforms/aggregators. Consequently, offline channels’ demise (e.g. [Thomas Cook](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thomas-cook-grp-investment-explainer/thomas-cook-collapses-why-and-what-happens-now-idUSKBN1W804O)) has further contributed to growth, however market-share theft begins to slow – as travel agencies cease operations. The homogeneity of options available further favours **BKNG**’s business model, however the rise of Airbnb might contradict that. Further travel trends of the past decade can be read [here](https://skift.com/2019/12/31/2010s-the-decade-travel-lost-control-of-its-destiny/).

**BUSINESS MODEL**

&#x200B;

[Table 1: Operating margins of select firms operating in sub-sectors of Travel and Tourism.](https://preview.redd.it/o0d5piytvv751.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c01206c1786337eb581e5c4716afda061619693)

High margin opportunities are rare within Travel and Tourism (“the sector”). **BKNG** possess a high-margin business model, serving a typically low-margin sector.

Booking Holdings’ portfolio contains market leaders, differentiated by business model and/or geography.

* **Booking.com** | The pièce de résistance. It is the [\#1](https://www.similarweb.com/website/booking.com/) travel platform across USA and Europe.
* **Agoda** | Ranking [\#4](https://www.similarweb.com/website/agoda.com/), as market leader in East Asia.
* **Rentalcars.com** | [\#1](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/travel-and-tourism/car-rentals/) platform-only (unlike Enterprise and Hertz) car rental aggregator.
* **Priceline.com** | The once flagbearer of aggregators, focussed on US and Canada.
* **KAYAK** | Successor to **Priceline.com**. USA and China are top markets.
* **OpenTable** | Restaurant booking and management services in primarily USA and Canada.

In Western markets, notable competition remains Expedia (**EXPE**), whilst Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) focusses on Asia. Its distinct businesses highlight their aspiration of “[the connected trip](https://skift.com/2019/12/03/what-does-online-travel-really-mean-by-a-connected-trip/)”, where a universe of services delivers an end-to-end vacation experience.

Revenue segments explained:

* **Agency revenues** | Commission taken without handling of payments – e.g. the “booking” and the “sale” are disparate.
* **Merchant revenues** | Commission is taken in addition to payment processing, fees etc.
* **Advertising and other revenues** | In-site advertising (“featured”); referrals fees by KAYAK; and bookings management services provided by OpenTable.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: BKNG revenue streams.](https://preview.redd.it/rp2f45e8wv751.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23a063ca382c6b421441c0933ead12aec0a1849c)

Aggregators suffer from low differentiation, meaning that KAYAK nor Priceline are dominant, however remain important for directing users to platforms (such as Booking.com or Agoda). Ownership or minority stakes encourages aggregators to selectively direct.

* Expedia (**EXPE**) has stakes in Despegar \[Latin America\] (**DESP**) and Trivago \[Europe\] (**TVGO**).
* Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) has stakes in Tongcheng Elong \[China\] and MakeMyTrip \[India\] (**MMYT**).
* Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) has stake in Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) – there’s always a bigger fish!

It’s dominant position worldwide combined with its vision make **BKNG** an attractive business.

**SHORT-TERM: AFTERMATH OF A PANDEMIC**

""I believe the COVID-19 virus will impact global travel more than the 9/11 terror attacks, the SARs epidemic and the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis combined.""*Glen D. Fogel, CEO of Booking Holdings (April 2020)*

This may sound fear-inducing but in reality, this statement says very little. Modern tourism has shown remarkable [resilience](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/book/10.18111/9789284414444) to past shocks. Like past crises, COVID-19’s impact can be separated into two hurdles to be overcome: the initial shock and the tail. The tourism-related impact events mentioned by Fogel are assessed.

* **September 11th terror attacks** | 1-day event created uncertainty of global travel, using aeroplanes. The sector generally recovered with 1 year, but NY tourism took [longer](http://www.modul.ac.at/uploads/files/Theses/Bachelor/BYSYUK_Impact_of_9_11_on_US_and_International_Tourism_Development.pdf).
* **2002-2004 SARS Outbreak** | Multi-year regional outbreak however Chinese tourism was not globally significant, accounting for [3.2%](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284406647) of all spending vs. [20%](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152) today.
* **Global Financial Crisis** | Sector ramifications felt later, however growth returned in [2010](https://www.unglobalpulse.org/project/economic-crisis-tourism-decline-and-its-impact-on-the-poor-2011/).

These events lack global severity or were felt over either the short-term or long-term. The [2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami](https://www.britannica.com/event/Indian-Ocean-tsunami-of-2004) characterises a shock event with long-term sector damage. All nations within the region [recovered](https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/EID14/EID14015FU1.pdf) by 2006, apart from worst-hit Indonesia where visitations returned by 2007. This is further testament to the sector’s ability to withstand the most brutal of events.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Variation in online traffic of select travel websites.](https://preview.redd.it/pvnb7gbrwv751.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=733932754a9a77ce73a35dd11ecf8ca1c4633e7f)

Further, [online traffic](https://www.similarweb.com/website/booking.com/) indicates a recovery. European-focussed platforms (HRS.de) and automotive rental platforms (Rentalcars.com & CarRentals.com). Regardless, average visits are down 70% since January, even after a May rebound.

This information may be received as comforting; however, the short-term outlook continues to remain choppy. A full sector recovery in 2020 is unlikely. The majority of BKNG sales stem from hard-hit USA and Europe, which [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/974548/when-will-travel-and-tourism-recover) predicts will not share a Chinese-style rebound. Moreover, consider the seasonality of booking periods. Vacations are normally booked 100-150 days in [advance](https://supercontrol.co.uk/the-bottom-line-on-bookings), implying – under normal circumstances – vacations up to September are mostly accounted for. Heavy sector discounting will spur some, but the importance of 1H sales remains undeniable.

&#x200B;

[Table 2: BKNG quarterly sales for 2019A and 2020E.](https://preview.redd.it/11rg2lmwwv751.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdde2b761e50593fcb2cd7249b5961cbd8a054fa)

The above table presents a Base scenario revenue change of -52.68% in 2020. Assumptions are made in blue.

**LONG TERM: AFTERMATH OF AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN**

The second sector-wide question refers to when will normality resume – indicated by sales resuming to 2019 levels. Research by [Wedbush](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3572209-booking-holdings-not-v-shaped-story-wedbush) points towards a multi-year recovery.

[Table 3: Modelled scenarios for BKNG post-coronavirus recovery.](https://preview.redd.it/lyfiay5dxv751.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06f543fc99bcc413ce66b9b284dcea935ddf29a)

Beyond, when focussing on the long-term prospects of **BKNG**, its fate is tied to, namely, sector growth and competition.

The exemplary track record of **BKNG** tells one possible story. “A rising tide lifts all boats” tells another possible story. As globe-trotting tourism becomes attainable to half of the world’s households by [2025](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/partner-with-us/documents/global-travel-and-tourism-insights-by-visa.pdf), sector growth is expected to outpace economic growth.

&#x200B;

[Table 4: Travel spending forecasts \(Visa, 2016\).](https://preview.redd.it/1yyjwe9hxv751.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=9260f1ff403aa9266e5e4ad2993afc78e4944f02)

If **BKNG** is to capitalize on this, capturing the Asian market is crucial. Chinese dominance will extend – only 10% of the population are passport holders; forecast to be 20% by [2027](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152). Agoda is the market-leader here, however strong liquidity enables inorganic growth levers to be pulled. The then Priceline Group acquired Booking.com in 2005 for $135M; a drop in the ocean compared to their current balance. With low interest rates, this should offset risks brought by increased debt.

When assessing competition, mode of booking (i.e. online) is unlikely to change, however preferred platform may. Management and others’ [concerns](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/google-moves-travel-expedia-group-ceo-calls-level-playing-field-search-results/) are mainly directed towards “Big Tech” firms Facebook (**FB**) and Google (**GOOGL**), due to their ability to integrate travel booking into other products (e.g. Google Maps). Low switching costs mean Booking Holdings’ established presence will provide little defence against the [2nd most valuable global brand](https://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/list). Antitrust concerns in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_vs._Google) and the limited presence of “Big Tech” in Asia provides **BKNG** with valuable time to strategize a defence. Further, medium-term tailwinds are unlikely to be derailed as a result.

**VALUATION**

&#x200B;

[Table 5: Overview of comparable companies. All ratios taken from Reuters, on an annual basis.](https://preview.redd.it/x5h2l047yv751.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6526ac85a6e83d489539f2bfcb0c72dfe3f560)

**BKNG** and peers have been reluctant to issue forward guidance. As investors look beyond 2020, 2021 forward earnings will be used to arrive at a current valuation.

&#x200B;

[Table 6: Multiples approach to valuation for BKNG.](https://preview.redd.it/soid9babyv751.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a8851f2a6f8d12c3c7c41de09659effb7fd378)

Current valuation favours a 52.68% 2020 revenue decline and a 2022 recovery. Trading around $1,600 provides little room for error. A decline to sub-$1,400 levels would provide suitable entry.

* **Short-Term** | PT: $1,400 | HOLD.

* [**Perpetual Growth Rate**](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG) | 2.74% (50Y avg. OECD members GDP growth, 1968-2018).
* **Perpetual Operating Margin** | 35.00%, similar to FY2019.

Regardless of the scenario, there is little difference in DCF valuation. Perpetual growth used is conservative given sector growth, and discount rate(s) reflect current market reality. A current share value of below $1,600 seems reasonable, when taking a long-term view on an investment providing an expected annual return of approximately 7.5%.

* **Long-Term** | PT: $1,600 | BUY.

**CONCLUSION**

The “travel bug” is not a Western phenomenon. The continued rise of Asian holidaymakers will solidify this. COVID-19 has rattled tourism and will crush near-term earnings, yet Booking Holdings (**BKNG**) possesses sizable competitive advantages in the following ways:

* Dominant position, globally.
* Respected platforms, and a [proven ability](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/priceline-changes-name-to-booking-ceo-weighs-in.html) to pivot focus to the top performer(s).
* Low-cost, high-margin business model.
* Long-term tailwinds within a resilient sector.
* Strong financial position. Cash balance comfortably covers 2020E expenses. Inorganic growth possible.

**BKNG** has proven to be a well-run business. Despite this, the market has shown its ruthlessness. As such, a 15% pull-back to attractive short-term levels is possible. For the long-term **BKNG** investor, competition will continue to be fierce. Booking Holdings arguably won the battle for the West. Whilst attentions will turn east, they must be careful not to lose focus on “home turf”. In Asia, Trip.com Group (**TCOM**) remains their biggest threat, however in the early stages there will be spoils for all. Lower sector growth is also concern, however unlikely. Yet, investors should take comfort knowing in a scenario where expected perpetual growth halves, **BKNG** remains within the short-term PT. Investors ought to continue loving vacations as much as everyone else.

When a momentum stock loses momentum and misses earnings, in my experience, it is usually fatal. I am not a huge student of the stock/industry but, imo, they are at the point where they either do something (I don't know what) which rights the ship or this is going to go on for 5, 7, 10 years and is existential. The only bright spot is that the new CEO is someone who has been there a while, usually when the CEO switches they need a clueless outsider to step into the meat tenderiser...so maybe there is hope.

But the return on brain damage is usually minimal. I used to look at a ton of these situations (it is kind of where most people end up after they get jaded with net-nets and shitty low p/e stocks) and never saw any inefficiencies. Your upside is usually 30-40% at best, and you make that almost never (maybe 1 in 10 or 15). Most stocks will just keep unwinding over 10 years and you lose half your money 3 in 4...the market gets these ones right almost always imo (being on the other side is a far better trade).","Biggest worry in my case around the OTA moat thesis is the potential entrance of Google in this space. Lots of people acknowledge that Google has a stranglehold on search and thus by proxy in OTA search - there is definitely an existential threat to the EXPE and BOOK oligopoly  ([source](https://skift.com/2019/03/11/google-quietly-releases-its-hotel-booking-destination-with-potentially-huge-implications/) ).

stock,SecurityAnalysis,BYND Stock,"Beyond Meat is supposed to IPO this year and as a vegan myself I'm curious if others have also looked into the business. Even if it IPOs at an inflated value, assuming the price stabelizes is anyone interested in also owning this company? Its hard to look into the fundamentals of a private company any tips? 

BYND seems to have a major market share and frankly produces a product which is unrivaled at the consumer level other than impossible foods which only sells to resturantes. They also hold a sizable cash position which they intend to deploy to aquire other brands and from what I've read have low debt. This market share plus their aquisition potential lead me to believe they can be the biggest player in the growing vegan foods industry in the future. They currently run the vegan beef market and their new vegan sausage line is gaining market share fast. With the addition of possibly a vegan dairy line (beyond milk?) Which is currently 11B+ in sales worldwide they can be a juggernaut. With the aquisition or partnership with a company like miyokos creamery (small vegan creamery that makes dairy alternitive which is clearly the best from a quality perspective but lacks in supply chain and resources compared to larger companies like daiay) that would be a dangerous combo to the market.

Edit: also a good amount of people are dogmatically opposed to veganism and the average investor who has these oppositions to veganism might also allow these biases to have a unreasonably negative outlook when deciding to invest in a company like BYND leading to deflated pricing? Is this possible?

Last year's financial data:
revenue was 88m
net loss 30m
Total assets 134m 
total liabilities 56m
IPO is set at 100m. 
Revenue up 104% YoY.

Competitor garden has comparable sales but less growth.

Thanks for posting. This has definitely been on my radar since the ~Nov S1 filing - I read the report right after it was uploaded. I think this is a really interesting stock. Some points:


&nbsp;


**Pros**

1) Ethan Brown seems like a great leader/jockey

2) Large TAM - fast growing market, the trends are in your favor

3) Not only is BYND a forerunner (along with Impossible) but it appears they are outpacing other competitors - widening the gap. I've done some scuttlebutt, tried their products, visited stores, talked to employees and these things fly off the shelves. 


&nbsp;


**Questions**

1) **Supply Chain:** Can they lower the price point of vegan meats? Do they have scale in their production? What will their profitability look like versus traditional meat producers?

2) Is this an industry where you get a second-mover advantage? I.e. BYND blows tons of money on R&D/advertising enabling the tech and consumers to embrace it, lowering gateway for competition.

3) I thought management's/board's salary seemed a bit high considering current size of company. I like to see mgmt with skin in the game.

4) Valuation. 88m revenue... 30m loss.. no matter what the price is if you're investing you need to believe in this company/industry/management. I don't know in my head where I draw the line.. $1.5B? $5B?","SEC S1 filing

**2023 9/12 TSLA GPT REPORT**

\[Title\] Tesla Inc. Stock Analysis

\[Brief\] A comprehensive analysis of Tesla Inc.'s stock performance and financial soundness.

\[Table of Contents\]

1. Summary of Articles
2. Financial Analysis
3. Valuation of the Stock
4. URLs Used for the Report

\[Summary of Articles\]

Tesla Inc's stock has been the subject of various analyses and developments. RBC reiterated Tesla as outperform, emphasizing the significant value of Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) technology and its potential positive impact on the company's stock price. However, Gordon Johnson, CEO at GLJ Research, criticized Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas's optimistic analysis of Tesla, questioning the unverified projections on Tesla's custom supercomputer, Dojo, and the impartiality of the analysis due to Morgan Stanley's significant investment in Tesla.

Tesla's growth and innovation continue to pose a significant threat to competitors like Volkswagen (VW), undermining VW's premium brand, Audi. This competitive pressure, coupled with the rise of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, could lead to a significant crisis for VW.

The Baron Partners Fund highlighted Tesla's significant growth, noting that Tesla's deliveries in China are recovering, and its new factory in Texas is ramping up production. The fund also emphasized Tesla's partnerships with other car manufacturers to provide access to Tesla's EV charging technology and network, validating Tesla's superior charging technology and infrastructure.

Tesla Inc's stock has entered bull-market territory after breaking through the 50-day moving average (50-DMA) resistance. The stock's rise was aided by an analyst upgrade and a labor dispute faced by Tesla's competitors. Tesla's lack of a unionized workforce could potentially give it an advantage, as a strike could delay competitors' EV roadmaps until 2024.

However, Tesla is facing regulatory scrutiny. The U.S. auto regulator, NHTSA, has issued a special order to Tesla, seeking information about changes to the driver monitoring system for its Autopilot software. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a federal investigation into Tesla over allegations of misuse of company resources for the construction of a mansion for CEO Elon Musk. The outcomes of these investigations could significantly impact Tesla's reputation, its compliance practices, and Musk's standing as a business leader, potentially affecting the company's stock price.

\[Financial Analysis\]

1. Current Ratio: The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. In this case, the current ratio is 43875/27592 = 1.59 or 159%, which is less than the 200% benchmark set by Graham. This suggests the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations.
2. Net Current Assets vs Long-term Liabilities: This measures if a company's short-term assets (minus its short-term liabilities) are sufficient to cover long-term debt. Here, net current assets are 16283, and long-term liabilities are 10817. Since 16283 10817, this criterion is met.
3. EPS Growth: This measures the percentage change in Earnings Per Share (EPS) over time. Unfortunately, the most recent data is not available.
4. Price Earnings Ratio (PER): This is a valuation ratio of a company's current share price compared to its per-share earnings. Graham suggests a PER of 15 or less. The most recent PER is 18.43, which is higher than Graham's recommendation.
5. PER\*PBR: This is the multiplication of the Price Earnings Ratio and Price Book Ratio. Graham suggests this should not exceed 22. The most recent PER\*PBR is 18.43\*1.84 = 33.95, which exceeds Graham's recommendation.
6. Total Debt Ratio: This measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total equity. The most recent ratio is 38409/52182 = 0.74 or 74%, which is less than 100%, meeting Graham's criterion.

In conclusion, the stock meets 2 out of the 6 criteria.

\[Valuation of the Stock\]

Given the financial analysis and the current market conditions, the stock appears to be overvalued. The stock does not meet most of Graham's criteria, suggesting that it may be overpriced. Additionally, the regulatory scrutiny and potential risks highlighted in the articles could negatively impact the stock's future performance.

Stock market,DueDiligence,$Prog- both shortsqueeze and fundamental play with catalyst news coming in days- (Wyckoff pattern in play again),"  

Short-Squeeze Argument

&#x200B;

1. SI is above >20% again making it a squeeze case      again. All that needed is retail volume. 
2. Highly oversold currently and historical January effect      always pushes the stocks throughout the month
3. Cathie Wood and Ark Investment have started to keep an      eye on Prog. The moment they take a position, it will definitely shoot the      stock price up.
4. Anytime the news/PR of Preecludia will drop that will definitely      be giving a boost to price since this development captures market worth      billions of dollars (3B+ market)
5. Prog just crossing the accumulation phase of Wyckoff      (2.13-2.16 range) is where October Wyckoff started and then went to $6.20.      As per Charts, if volume comes in, it will go above $7.80-$8.30 this time      without news

Buyout Argument

&#x200B;

1. Management is dead silent and isn't defending stock      price at all. Usually the case when BO is an option and management doesn't      care about current market price or feels the need to defend (Look at other      companies defending stock prices, Tesla, AMC,GME, ATER and many more.)
2. Management is loading off the assets to focus on core      business- another sign for a clean BO.
3. Company cleared debts in form of shares instead of cash      payments- another sign that debt is being reduced and creditors are ok      accepting shares
4. Executives accepting their compensation at higher prices      (CEO has shares at $3.11) while market prices keeps being hammered down
5. Their largest shareholder accumulating shares after      days of  dips- Athyrium accumulated      millions of shares from November to December - wants the largest piece of      pie by shaking retail holders.
6. Prog appointed a director who worked for Pfizer before      and has Merger & Acquisition expertise soon after Prog signed its 3rd      partnership with a big pharma
7. Pfizer was in news multiple times seeking acquisitions in      the industry (arna being the first one)

**Catalysts:**

&#x200B;

1. 3 Confirmed signed partnerships with big pharma. PR was      supposed to be out in days as per CEO words but we can clearly see someone      is pulling the strings (Athyrium )
2. My best guess is Pfizer, JnJ, and AbbVie are the partners      , however , Moderna, Merck could also be in the game.
3. Preeecludia PR is expected to be out in coming week.      Expected Topline PK/PD data in last Quarter of 2021 (tomorrow starts the      last week).

**Athyrium** actions to control the price

   
 

&#x200B;

1. If you look at Prog documentation, it’s clear that      Athyrium can do shorting whenever they want which is happening      aggressively since last run.
2. Barcoding and stop loss hunt happening all over again.
3. Sudden ATM offer when retail pushed Prog higher is      another proof that Athyrium attempted to take control back.
4. 3-5 cents move on the daily again with lower volume      which is again the perfect strategy Athyrium was using before.

P.S: you can review my previous posts ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/qabid5/prog\_why\_its\_the\_easiest\_shortsqueeze\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/qabid5/prog_why_its_the_easiest_shortsqueeze_with/)) to see that I was 100% right on barcoding and stop loss hunt and its shares accumulation strategy.

Stock market,DueDiligence,Danaos Corporation (DAC) DD,"UPDATE: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410601-why-bull-market-in-container-shipping-will-continue


Hey! I'm looking for feedback on my DD, as I am learning how to write them. This should be an easier one since DAC is the number one stock on SeekingAlpha and has a strong buy rating at Zach's. Any input is appreciated!

Danaos Corporation (DAC) Due Diligence

DAC is a textbook turnaround. 

What they do:

Danaos Corporation (DAC) is a container ship leasing company founded in 1972, headquartered in Greece, listed on the NYSE. Their fleet includes 65 containerships of varying size. They lease their ships out for longer term contracts to ship liner companies who run freight internationally. 

Who they are:

Insiders own 46% of the float. The CEO is the son of the founder. The board is stacked with engineers, which is a good thing in my book. 

Specific Market:

The containership leasing rates just skyrocketed in response to shipping demand picking up from the COVID bounce back. DAC just re-leased 26 of their 65 ships at rates nearly 3x what they were leased at beforehand. The average length of these new charters is about 2 years. There are no new ships being built at the moment as the shipping industry came out of a bust cycle recently. It takes two years for a ship to be built, so rates will not be largely affected by competition in the near future. The performance of the sector is showing this. Marine shipping has been the best performing industrial sector, up 56% in the past three months.

Financials:

Net asset value of $51.60 per share. If they liquidated today, their assets would be worth more to an equity investor than the stock. P/E of 3.45 &amp; PEG of 2.44 both are under the marine shipping industry averages: P/E 10.92 &amp; PEG 3.77. Gross, operating and profit margins are all above industry average at 72%, 43%, 33%, respectively. 

Technicals:

Setting new highs since last August. Trading above SMA 20,50 &amp; 200. Solid upward corridor pattern. Back in it’s hay day, DAC was trading above $80 a share. Short interest is at 10%. 

Why I like the stock:

DAC’s stock got pounded by the restructuring and recent stock dilution. Since then, debt has been cut in half and a share buyback has taken place. They have their priorities right. They are coming out on the other side of this to a boom cycle in the shipping industry with a serious moat that will hold for the mid-term. Also, shipping isn’t a sexy or exciting business. This may be one of the few areas that hasn’t been overbought and run up to crazy multiples already with the COVID bounce back. This is a 1-to-3-year turnaround play for me. DAC is listed at a strong buy rating at Zach’s and SeekingAlpha has DAC listed as their number one recommendation. 

Downsides:

I’m not a fan of a company headquartered in Greece. They don’t have the best reputation but hey that plays into the low market price of the stock. International shipping is dependent on international politics which could change at a whim, but Biden’s trade policies appear to be pretty internationally friendly. The 2018 refinancing and 2019 share dilutions left the company with a black eye.

The Norwegian air shuttle, hereafter referred to as NAS 

NAS has a market cap of 1.619 billion dollar, which translates to 14.58 billion NOK 
(Norwegian Air Shuttle, 2020) 
NAS have a high debt to equity ratio (4,7) as of may 14 2020 which implies high volatility of the stock and put us in riskier territory, especially in account of more recent findings and future projections – more on that later. 


“Total revenue in the third quarter of 2020 was NOK 1,288 million (14,404), a decrease of 91 percent. Unit revenue increased by 28 percent following a yield increase of 92 percent and a decreased load factor by 30.6 percentage points. Average sector length decreased by 55 percent.”

1.	Threat of new entrants 
In the airline segment which craves huge amounts of real-investments make it a difficult industry to break into. But if we focus on the low-cost segment of airlines there are first of a lot of other airlines that would want to swallow up that market share of whish NAS is losing its grip. Furthermore, the threat of new entrants is particularly high since airlines that are not primarily in the low-cost segment can easily break in as they can leverage existing expertise, cash flow and brand identity to push in. The capital requirement are as mentioned really high but the risk-factor in this regard isn’t completely new ventures but rather already existing companies which have managed the pandemic better and would easily take over the current lease agreements held by NAS for the routes and airstrips. 

2.	Threat of substitutes
The threat of subsidy is generally not very high, while some of the shorter routes could be substituted for faster trains but there aren’t really a substitute for longer travels. That is for airlines in general, however low-cost airlines like NAS could very well be substituted for other types of commercial flights. 
 
“The years since 2017 have been challenging for the airline industry. Various geopolitical and macroeconomic issues impacted the trading environment, and intense competition and a rising cost environment, notably increases in fuel prices, but also labor costs in some cases, squeezed margins of all operators. In addition, terrorist attacks in Barcelona and London and the Brexit vote dulled consumer confidence and dampened demand.” (Norwegian Air Shuttle, 2020)

 
NAS have been particularly affected by this, because they tried to get ahead of a lot of other low-cost airlines – they bought their fleet in bulk and quickly expanded to multiple destinations. This made them really vulnerable to a decline in air travel because of the huge amounts debt they undertook. So, as well as the macroeconomic headwinds and the crushing effects of the pandemic NAS are up for a big challenge to say in the least. 

However, the globalization definitely decreased its curve because if the previously stated macroeconomic issues along with the pandemic but this is in my opinion a temporarily decline. Because, together with a growing population which craves more products and more food and the way to make that happen are with more globalization which mean economies of scale, this is in other words a necessity for our growing world. We will see the same kind of closeness to far off destinations as we have seen before and this is done with airlines. 

NAS:s Perceived level of product differentiation is increasing by the restructuring with a bigger focus on Nordic countries and less routes which will yield bigger market shares in the Nordics and they don’t have to fight with a lot bigger and diverse airlines like Ryan Air. In the Nordics they will compete with airlines like SAS and Finn Air, and NAS unique low-cost model will help them stay in the lead.  

3.	Bargaining power of customers
As mentioned in the quote above, intense competition and a rising cost environment have made the bargaining power of consumers higher. It is hard for the airlines to differentiate and or make customers exclusive. When people are looking for a flight plan they aren’t screening each airline company, since it is a lot easier to just go to a website like momondo or the like. So, the different airlines are almost completely interchangeable. 

That is, within the same market segment. But NAS has as they say it a “Unique low-cost model. High quality, efficient and at low cost” which I am very inclined to agree with. Sure there are a lot of other low cost airlines but few have the same quality aircraft and services as NAS. Comparing for example Ryan Air and NAS, NAS provides a lot more customer satisfaction in 2019, NAS was, for the fifth year in a row, named by passengers in the Skytrax rating ten the world's best ""Low-Cost Long-Haul Airline"", in addition to Europe's second-best ""Low-Cost Airline"" after being named best six years in a row in 2018

4.	Bargaining power of suppliers
“The Group's financial results are affected by the evolution of the market price of jet fuel, as fuel costs are the single largest cost item for the Group. Jet fuel costs represented 34 percent of the Group's operating costs (before aircraft leasing and depreciation) in 2019. The operating results of the Group can be materially affected by changes in the price and availability of jet fuel.”
Boeing, the supplier of 737 MAX aircrafts have been sued by NAS because of extensive engine problems and were therefor grounded until clearance to fly from aviation authorities. However, a re-introduction of these planes could create some upside risk to expected growth according to (Norwegian Air Shuttle, 2020). 

5.	Competitive rivalry
Powerful competitive strategy which could potentially be realized by adhering to Porter‘s work on low cost versus differentiation.
NAS has a competitive advantage against other airlines because of their low-cost strategy coupled with their fleet which is one of the most modern around. So as a passenger you can choose one of the cheapest flights while having amenities usually associated with airlines on the other side of the price spectrum. If you compare NAS with Ryan Air, Ryan Air is a lot bigger and a lot more financially stable (they have already bounced back to their pre-Covid stock price) but worse customer relations in the Nordics in which NAS has a stronghold. For example you can´t even fly Ryan Air from Stockholm’s main airport. As NAS are descaling and putting larger focus on the Nordic market they will benefit greatly from this and give them a better chance of survival.  
As for other competitive advantages, while NAS have been hit harder than most their restructure plan shows great promise. Which involves a big restructuring of the company to match the new market. They laid down over 70 routes, sold 24 aircrafts in 2019 and made a decision to further reduce their fleet to focus more on the Nordic market in which they have a lot more marketing presence and more loyal customers since NAS caters more to the Nordic climate and landscape also in close cooperation with local businesses and tourism. NAS also went under an organizational transformation with a new board and group management with a new strategy of profitability rather than growth. The financial restructuring opened up for governmental aid and different kinds of creditor protection. The fist part of the restructuring was successful and they gained reliefs by two of their main subsidiaries filed for examinership in Ireland. A report by Deloitte recommends full protection from its creditors based on the restructuring which will yield profitability by 2022. 
Although NAS will be smaller then before it is expected that when or if NAS manages to stay afloat until the restrictions have eased up that it will be a lot stronger within the new segment and gain market shares within the Nordics as they build a more profitable base before a possible future growth. 

Strengths 
NAS managed a full company restructuring which gave improved balance sheet with NOK 23 billion and is planning further improvements.
   Achieved an equity ratio of 15%
New board and new strategy for a smaller but more profitable company. 

Weaknesses 
Denied additional governmental help which is a really important issue, since without a full protection from creditors it is believed that NAS will be out of business in the first quarter of 2021. 
   There are still big debts because of their now scraped plan of huge expansion and that debt made then vulnerable even before the pandemic. 
   There are still travel restrictions in effect and a quick and sudden jump in air travels are unlikely 

Opportunities 
The vaccines are really coming together and if they are successful we could se a surge in air travel demand which will cause a chain reaction with investors willing to aid airlines and in this financial climate things move quicker than ever and can possibly give enough investments to make the airlines profitable again. 
   MAX 737 are no longer grounded – high possibility of a settlement in their suit against Boeing 
   The capital restructuring might enable more governmental aid. 

Threats 
The option to extend creditor protection could be denied and the amounting debt is then called upon which will effectively put NAS into bankruptcy. 
   Even if the creditor protection is approved, it is not going to matter if the boarders aren´t opening up soon and people think it is okay to fly again.
   Projections for passenger revenue for the industry as a whole are even when accounting for the fastest possible recovery negative 4%. For a moderate recovery, negative 18% and the projection for the slowest recovery negative 63%. These projections speak heavily towards a gloomy outlook for NAS. 

Conclusion 
To conclude from the text, an investment in NAS are coupled with high risk which is reflected in the stock price which has declined from about 40 NOK during 2019 to 0.4 NOK as of November 2020.  The P/E ratio is -0,19, volatility is 154,5%, P/S is 0,07 
 
But what I conclude from my analysis is that while it is a big risk the reward can be incredible, an investment of about 50$ would equal ca 1000 NAS and if they manage not to belly up during 2021 they will most likely pull out of this nose dive and be able to start serving customers again which would mean a big surge in the whole industry and a company like NAS have an incredible possibility to gain thousands precent. Let’s say the stock gain half of its worth in 2019 that 50$ would yield a bit more that 2000$. My position is that the stock is a bit oversold at the moment and people have dismissed NAS and that the risk to reward ratio makes a smaller bet on this product worthwhile. Because the thing is NAS only have to stay alive one more year to almost make their recovery a certainty. So after taking into account NAS as a smallercompany and stock dilution, I wouldn’t consider selling within 5 years.

(Edit: I have also posted this in r/pennystocks & r/PennyDD. Please feel free to comment and share your opinions

DBVT is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical working on treatments for food allergies. The Company is focused on immunotherapy that works through skin absorption. Market cap. is about $600M.

**What the galaxy says:**

According to a study done by the Centers for Disease Control (adapted from [company website](https://www.dbv-technologies.com/)):

* Approximately 4-6% of children and 1.5% of adults in Europe are affected by food allergies. 3.5 million of these are under the age of 25.
* Approximately 8% of children in the US have a food allergy. There was an estimated 50% increase in prevalence of food allergies among children in the US between 1997-2011
* Australia saw a 350% increase in hospital admissions that were as a result of food-related allergic reactions, mostly in children below 4 years of age

**The pilots of the ship**

* DBVT was founded in 2002 by Dr. Pierre-Henri Benhamou (Pedriatric Gastroenterology), Engineer Bertrand Dupont (from the Arts et Métiers ParisTech) and Professor Christophe Dupont (head of the Pediatric Gastroenterology Department, Necker Hospital, Paris). Pierre-Henri and Christophe currently sit on the scientific advisory board.
* *Daniel Tassé, CEO*: has a B.Sc. in Biochemistry from Université de Montréal (1982) and 30+ years in pharma & pediatric business development. Previous to this, he was the CEO of Alcresta Therapeutics (where he guided the company in launching its first successful product, [RELiZORB](http://www.alcresta.com/news/alcresta-therapeutics-announces-relizorb%C2%AE-immobilized-lipase-cartridge-has-been-issued). Alcresta is not publicly traded, but had only $20M of funding in 2013 before Daniel joined, compared to $80+M when he left). Previous to that, he was CEO of Ikaria Inc. (where he managed to expand operations to Asia, successfully led the development of the company’s first product, INOMAX, and grew revenues from $160M to over $420M in just 4 years. [Ikaria was finally acquired in 2015 by Mallinckrodt Pharma $MNK for $2.3 billion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mallinckrodt-completes-acquisition-of-ikaria-300067479.html) and Daniel worked for MNK briefly as Commercial Senior Vice President, reporting directly to the CEO after the acquisition)
* *Pharis Mohideen, M.D, Chief Medical Officer*\*\*:\*\* holds an M.D., M.S. in human physiology and B.A. in biology from the University of Hawaii, as well as an M.S. in clinical investigation from Vanderbilt University. He has 15+ years’ experience in clinical development. He had various previous roles as director (5yrs at Bristol-Myers Squibb & 6yrs at Novartis), and chief medical officer at Millendo Therapeutics

**The flight guidance system**

The stock traded between $8 and $10 pre-covid. It is currently trading around support at $4.5. In fact, the last time it traded around these lows was in December 2018 when the company voluntarily withdrew their BLA application for the Viaskin Peanut product due to “insufficient level of detail about the manufacturing and quality controls”. (Keep in mind, the new CEO joined in November 2018 and he is a thorough man). The price fell from $16 to $4 and they were subsequently sued. The hearing is pending in New Jersey. Previous to this, the price dropped from $42 to $28 in October 2017 when the company announced that the Viaskin Peanut clinical trial failed to achieve statistical significance in the lower end of the 95% confidence interval by a small margin (target was 15%, results indicated 12.4%)

*Competitor $AIMT (market cap. $1B) benefited from both of these price moves, but lost the gains as swiftly as they came. In fact, they were unlucky that the approval of their oral tablets for allergy treatment was on January 31st, but they didn’t benefit from the price move due to covid. Furthermore, their drug* [*is priced at $890 per month, only shows benefit after 2 years*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aimmune-says-peanut-allergy-drug-155030544.html)*, and is still dogged by* [*side effects*](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-drug-treatment-peanut-allergy-children) *like abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, tingling in the mouth, itching (including in the mouth and ears), cough, runny nose, throat irritation and tightness, hives, wheezing and shortness of breath and anaphylaxis. This drug must still undergo a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). i.e. it can only be administered in a controlled environment (parents have to take their kids to a certified hospital every 2 weeks) and the administering nurses, doctors and patients all have to register for the REMS.*

**Wallet situation**

In their [most recent press release,](https://www.dbv-technologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dbv-technologies-provides-operational-and-business-update_062620_final.pdf) the company indicated that their cash runway (€262 million) can last through 2021.

The financials are lacklustre. In the past 3 years, revenue has stagnated at around $10M (although they beat estimates). However, since the new CEO was appointed, EPS grew 7% in the first year and 29% in the second year, and they have secured $200M in financing. Not too bad, not too good either, but given the CEO’s strong track record, the good things are yet to come

**The rocket fuel**

Viaskin technology is currently under review by the FDA. Taget action date for Viaskin Peanut is set for August 5. Viaskin Egg & Viaskin Milk will follow soon after. These products have a US FDA Fast Track designation. You may ask why a French company is developing treatment therapies in the US, and the answer would be that because on average, the process of drug review is 2-3 months faster in the USA than in the EU. If the FDA accepts the test data and gives a way forward on a date for inspection of the manufacturing facilities, then the race for allergy treatments would be blown wide open. It could probably soar back to the $16 range where it was in 2018 before that damned BLA withdrawal, or we can dream about a Saturn landing and aim for $42 where it was in 2017 before the clinical trials failed by the small margin. Nine (9) analysts have given it a short-term price target of $9 and mid-term target of $25, but I like the CEO’s track record and I prefer to dream bigger.

**Some other windows to to stargaze**

1. [The big boys are in on this one](https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5906514/engineers-gate-manager-lp-invests-55000-in-dbv-technologie-s-nasdaqdbvt.html), many since February 2020 and some as recently as June 2020: Baker Brothers (11m shares), Arrowpoint Asset Management (4m), Perceptive Advisors (4M), Boxer Capital (3m), Morgan Stanley (2m), Amundi (1.4m), and Fidelity (574k). Sabby missed this rocket, which makes stargazing all the more beautiful. In total, institutions own 44% of the shares.
2. There are also also recent acquisitions of stock in (in June 2020) by a number of index funds like FTIHX, IMRFX & JCCIX..
3. The FDA had questions about the impact of the patch adhesion to its efficacy (remember, no safety issues were reported during the clinical trial). The company has already responded to this query but the FDA has given no further feedback apart from that the data was being reviewed. At this point, it is a coin flip game. High risk, high reward.
4. The data mentioned in point (iii) above has been published in multiple peer-reviewed scientific publications ([this one](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ocean/aap/pre-prints/content-200047?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Allergy_Asthma_Proc_TrendMD_0) and [this one](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ocean/aap/2020/00000041/00000004/art00009) and [this one](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(19)32155-4/abstract)). All reviews show positive data.
5. The company recently trimmed down its workforce (something that is notoriously difficult to do in France) and scaled down other clinical programs in order to focus on the Viaskin Peanut product which is coming up for review on August 5th. (This simply indicates that they are very serious about this niche, or that they are prepared for a possible delay of the FDA’s decision)
6. [DBVT is collaborating with Nestlé](https://www.forbes.com/sites/genemarcial/2016/06/07/dbv-tech-forms-magic-partnership-with-nestle/#1da2911f74b4) in a deal worth €100M to develop more product candidates (e.g. Viaskin milk). Nestlé is the largest food company in the world with over 2000 brands and generates $93 billion plus in revenue each year since 2008. However, [Nestlé is as notorious as all big companies are, and food allergies have been one of the legal thorns in their flesh for a while](https://legalnewsline.com/stories/511116568-class-action-filed-over-anti-allergy-nestle-products). They are personally invested in this peanut allergy product and this collaboration has not been affected by the covid crisis. (Fun fact: Nestle also owns 18% of $AIMT, the competitor company. They are hedging their bets)
7. Skin patch therapy is *potentially* more marketable among the market segment that they are targeting (childen & infants) than pills. In addition, they would have potentially less side effects because the active compound gets directly into the bloodstream, and does not get absorbed via the liver.
8. Consider that it is a French company and the big influence France has in the EU. If they get approved, they might get approval support from the French government too.",4,Im liking it however what caused the major drop near the end of June? Was it an offering? Also that volume is so low bruh which could be a good or bad thing depending on how she moves with above average volume.

# SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

* **Brand Image** \- This company isn't going anywhere any time soon. They hold a reputation that often precedes them when it comes to quality and performance.
* **Product variation** \- The company is involved in multiple industries and products. They operate within Civil Aerospace, Defence Aerospace, Marine and Nuclear to name a few.
* **Few competitors** \- Due to the high skilled workforce required and high entry costs into the respective markets coupled with the economies of scale that Rolls royce has access to it will be incredibly hard to displace them in many of the industries that they are involved with. Rolls Royce also often wins government contracts that provide the business with further stability for example a 1 billion pound contract with the UK government for nuclear submarine cores ([https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/37036/rolls-royce-wins-1bn-nuclear-submarine-contract-from-uk-government-44277.html](https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/37036/rolls-royce-wins-1bn-nuclear-submarine-contract-from-uk-government-44277.html))

Weaknesses:

* **COVID-19** \- The business has taken a big hit from the pandemic as demand for many of the products it sells has fallen, most notably in the aerospace sector. This is coupled with the fact that now that many businesses are weakened financially they may not feel that the extra expense of RR products are worth it, as they operate on a high price high quality pricing strategy, it may be that businesses look to cut corners on a cheaper alternative.

Opportunities:

* **Increased focus on automation**: The company has really been investing in building self-driven cars. Self driven EVs look to be the future of auto travel and RR is at the cutting edge of the automation required to operate these vehicles. It may be that this is deployed in their own line of cars or that the technology is sold to other car manufacturers.
* **Focus on green and hybrid vehicles** \- predictably the company is focused on trying to build green and hybrid vehicles and the valuations of similar companies has risen dramatically as progress in this area is made. If RR makes some progress catching up to established players such as Tesla then there could be a potential upside in share price.
* **New forays into space exploration** \- RR has recently signed a contract with the UK Space Agency to look at the possibility of using nuclear power options in space exploration. This is extremely exciting as it shows intent in a sector that looks to make some great growth in the coming years and RR seems to be close to the head of that.

Threats:

* **Focus on sustainability** \- one of the issues with RR is that it does draw some of its income from civil aerospace. Following on from the pandemic and the rise of zoom, ideas such as 'the great reset' are bringing air travel under fresh scrutiny it is possible that the industry will not recover to pre pandemic heights for some time due to the carbon footprint that flights cause.
* **Cost of raw materials** \- some raw material costs rising have been a minor issue in the supply chain.

# Potential upside?

Rolls royce seems focused on the future. If they can mount a good recovery from the COVID crash it seems there could still be a long way to go in terms of share price. A share currently trades for under a $ which shows a great investing opportunity as the stock may find its way back to the 3-4$ per share range. RR can also be seen as a very long term play. This company is on the cutting edge of research and development and it is not inconceivable that new technologies, such as electric aircraft, may allow them to make leaps and bounds in the coming years

Yahoo Finance analysts provide a very mixed bag of recommendations, in the attached image, although the analysts price targets show a very different story as the lowest estimate (675) is still far greater than the current (98.66).

# TLDR

The company may ride the wave out of the pandemic in the short to medium term and looks great in the long term

It just peaked and the MACD is below the line so it will go lower, maybe to $1.18 based on prior moves. Put in a buy at $1.18 for a week. If you get it good, if it starts going up again buy it at that time.","I like RYCEY as a long hold, and this is a good attempt at DD; BUT

You missed a few points and a few inaccuracies

Weakness: 

RR does not make money by selling their (Commercial) engines. Funny enough, they bill their customers based on flight hours. With so many planes grounded, that is their largest weakness.  Nothing to do with the price of the engines.

Also worth noting that the alternatives aren't necessarily cheaper (their only real competitors P&W and GE).

&#x200B;

Opportunities:

RR does not own or operate RR Automotive. That is owned by BMW after being split off decades ago. This makes 2 of your ""opportunities"" meaningless. RR Holdings (RYCEY / RR.L) are not working on any cars EV, Autonomous, or hybrid. 

They are working on Electric, and alternative-fuel Jet engines, as well as have finished ground testing the worlds fastest Electric propeller airplane.

Potential Upside:

Yahoo finance does not take into account the share dilution by the annalists yet. It split in December as part of an offering to raise billions in cash. Price target they give is divided by about 4.","I've been in for a little while. But it may help you to have a look at whats going on in the background and why there were such large drops

Most of all strip all emotion out of your DD, don't ignore a red flag just because you like the look of the company/stock.","Sorry I cannot help you, other than to say I regularly check google finance and yahoo finance. I am also curious what some more experienced users have to say, especially in regard to finding relevant news and catalysts."

**Industry Overviews**

*Healthcare:* The healthcare industry is the most profitable in the U.S. The Biotechnology industry is ranked #6 in the U.S for the highest net margin (24.6%). Major pharmaceutical companies are ranked #4 in the U.S for the highest net margin (25.5%). Generic Pharmaceutical companies rank #1 in the U.S for the highest net margin (30%). \[Source\](https://bluewatercredit.com/ranking-biggest-industries-us-economy-surprise-1/)

*Aviation:* The aviation industry took a big hit during COVID-19. This created the perfect opportunity for new companies to enter the market which will cause increased levels of competition.

*Power/Energy:* There has been a lot of debate regarding fossil fuels and renewable energy. “The U.S Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative aims to reduce the price of solar energy 50% by 2030, which is projected to lead to 33% of U.S. electricity demand met by solar and a 18% decrease in electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” An increase in U.S oil prices has shifted investors’ attention towards the renewable energy market. \[Source\](https://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-renewable-energy-factsheet)

**Competitors**

* Siemens (SIEGY)
* 3M (MMM)
* Emerson (EMR)
* United Technologies (RTX)
* Philips (PHG)
* Schneider Electric (SBGSY)

**Digital Transformation Failure**

This is some old news but it is important to understand what went wrong. In 2015, General Electric created a subdivision called GE Digital. They hoped to dominate the industrial internet. However, GE was slow to digitally transform. Most companies transformed in the ‘90s and mid-2000. GE dumped billions of dollars into this project and appointed thousands of employees to oversee the transformation. So where did they go wrong? GE moved away from its core business and spread its resources too thin. They focused on quantity instead of quality. Well-knownGE’s companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google who dominate the tech industry, made it hard to compete.

**Porter’s Five Forces Model**

1. *Threats of New Entrants*
   1. Increased competition in the aviation industry
   2. Barrier to Entry (Healthcare): Regulation from HIPAA and FDA
   3. Barriers to Entry (Renewable Energy): Lack of infrastructure, fewer government subsidies compared to fossil fuels
   4. The overall threat of new entrants is weak due to the high cost of entry
2. *Supplier Bargaining Power*
   1. GE has an extensive list of suppliers which can be found \[here\]([https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE))
      1. The most notable suppliers are: 3M (MMM), Honeywell International (HON), Boeing (BA), ExxonMobil (XOM), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)
      2. A lot of these suppliers products overlap with each other, meaning, GE has many options
3. *International Competition*
   1. Competition is stiff from companies like Siemens and 3M
4. *Threat of Substitutes*
   1. There are few substitutes in the market so the threat is minimal
5. *Customer Bargaining Power*
   1. GE has a wide range of customers which can be found \[here\]([https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competition2.php?supply&code=GE))
      1. The most notable suppliers are: Dish Network (DISH), Emerson Electric (EMR), Honeywell International (HON), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Boeing (BA), ABB (ABB), Honda Motor Co. (HMC)
      2. It is interesting to note that a couple of GE suppliers are also GE customers

**Technical Analysis**

General Electric formed a Head and Shoulders pattern starting on June 17, 2021, and ended on July 15, 2021. This pattern was soon followed by a breakdown. Since then, the stock has been operating in a horizontal channel with resistance at $107 and $98. Look to enter the market around the lower resistance mark. We’d also like to highlight the month of March. There was a lot of positive news during March which explains the increase in GE share price. Reference the timeline for more information.

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GE/VhBEziuC-General-Electric-GE-TA/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GE/VhBEziuC-General-Electric-GE-TA/)

**Bullish Case**

* Green Movement/Carbon Neutrality (Aviation/Energy industries)
* CEO Larry Culp driving down debt and liabilities 
* Lack of substitutes in the market

**Bearish Case**

* Digital Transformation Failure
* Stiff Competition (*Siemens* and 3M)
* Healthcare Industry Regulation
* Lack of infrastructure in Energy Industry

**Conclusion**

General Electric has struggled these past 5 years which is partly due to the digital transformation failure. GE spread its resources too thin and moved away from its core business. GE could have been more profitable if they focused on developing their money makers in the Healthcare, aviation, and energy industries. That being said, GE is now focusing more on those industries. GE’s acquisition of BK Medical is a big step in the right direction for healthcare profit. Aside from that, the new GEnx jet engines are quite impressive. The increased fuel efficiency and reduced carbon emissions are attractive to customers amid the growing global commitment to reach carbon neutrality. GE has been known to create terrific jet engines. Back in WWII, their J-47 engine dominated the skies. If you look up the best/most popular jet engines in history, you’ll find out they were made by GE. GE has been making some major moves in the renewable energy industry. Most recently in the wind power sector. Emphasis on global carbon neutrality will have a positive impact on General Electric in the future. CEO Larry Culp is committed to driving down debt and liabilities. Long Term Debt debt has decreased by 45% in five years and Total liabilities have decreased by 32% in five years. In order to drive down these numbers, the CEO has slashed dividends. If you’re looking for a similar company with a higher yield dividend, we suggest you look into United Technologies (3.37%) or 3M (3.26%). Despite General Electric's performance these past 5 years, we believe that GE can bounce back...If General Electric focuses on its core business (Healthcare, Aviation, and Energy), it will be very profitable.

**Behind the Company**

Square is an e-commerce platform for small and large businesses. Square makes it easier for customers to pay for products and services. Square’s biggest product currently is a card reader that enables businesses to offer credit card payments instead of solely using cash. Square owns the popular Cash App which allows users to send payments, receive payments, invest, hold, and buy/sell bitcoin.

**Industry Overview**

The buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry has seen some major growth this past year. There are advantages to using BNPL over credit cards. With BNPL technology, consumers don’t have to worry about their credit scores. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage. If you have a low credit score, you can use Square to avoid taking more hits on your credit. However, you can’t build up your credit score using Square.

Square CEO Jack Dorsey is somewhat a prodigy. Having co-founded Twitter back in 06’, Jack now. Dorsey is one of the most successful self-taught coders in the world. Not many CEOs can say they’ve helped build their companies' platforms and helped manage them. 

**Conclusion**

I am concerned about Mastercard’s announcement to enter the BNPL market. I believe that other credit cards and banks will follow suit. Up until now, banks have been slow to respond and are sustaining huge losses because of it. The BNPL market is pretty saturated as it is. The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square’s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square’s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share.

[**Introduction**](https://www.nexteraenergy.com/)

Renewable energy has gained popularity amid a rising Green Movement. Currently, the leading source of global energy comes from oil, coal, natural gas, and hydroelectricity. The United Nations Summit on Climate and Environment has stressed the importance of carbon neutrality and many countries have taken the pledge to reduce carbon emissions. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is dedicated to expanding the U.S electric grid.

**Behind the Company**

NextEra Energy (NEE) is the largest utility company in the U.S based out of Juno Beach, Florida. The main goal of the company is to work towards renewable, emission-free energy. NEE sells energy to third parties sourced from its wind, solar, and natural gas farms. NextEraEnergy’s goal is to increase dividends by building utilities and expanding assets. 

**Macro Market View**

In December 2020, The United Nations held a global summit on climate and environment. The UN stressed the importance of reaching carbon neutrality as global temperatures increase. This is easier said than done. At the heart of CO2 emissions are oil and coal. Third-world countries that don’t have access to clean energy are unable to pledge to carbon neutrality. Oil prices have hit a three-year high. This is due to the global supply chain bottleneck. The increase in oil prices has shifted consumer demand towards cleaner energy, specifically natural gas. On top of that, the U.S is in the process of passing The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill which plans to invest $73B into electric grids. This will allow more access to clean energy in the U.S.

**Bullish Case**

* Climate and Environment Summit stresses carbon neutrality

* Renewable Energy is inaccessible to developing countries
* Fear of oversupply of energy

**Management** 

* James L. Robo - Chairman and CEO (NextEra Energy)
   * Joined the company in March 2002 as Vice President of Corporate Development
   * Named president and CEO in July 2012 and chairman in December 2013
   * Has worked in energy for most of his professional career.
   * Graduated from Harvard College in 1984 where he was a Baker Scholar recipient.
   * Also the Director of J.B. Hunt Transport Services

**Conclusion**

NextEra Energy (NEE) is well-positioned within the energy industry. Macroeconomic factors such as the United Nations Summit on Climate and Environment, the U.S Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, and Green Movement are spurring the race for clean energy. However, Wind and solar power production are limited to environmental changes and are less reliable than fossil fuels. The lack of current infrastructure makes accessibility to renewable energy hard. That being said, the U.S is taking the right steps to make renewable energy more accessible. NEE is aiming to increase dividends by 10% year after year in what we believe to be an effort to retain long-term investors. COVID-19 has put a halt to increasing dividends. We believe that NEE used the $1.25B tax bailout to sustain dividends during this past fiscal loss of $350 million. Overall, NextEra Energy is a healthy company with a strong long-term outlook.

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

📷

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

Risk management,DueDiligence,$DAC - Analysis and DD - A 2023 Deep Value Play,"For a more in-depth analysis, I have also posted in the Search Of Value Forum. Link to my post there: [https://www.searchofvalue.com/post/danaos-shipping-corp-a-2023-deep-value-opportunity](https://www.searchofvalue.com/post/danaos-shipping-corp-a-2023-deep-value-opportunity)

**INTRODUCTION**

The Danaos Corporation ($DAC) is a freight charter company. It is heavily undervalued by numerous metrics - trading at a EV/EBITDA of 1.89, 0.52 P/B, a 3.52x P/E, and a 0.18x Debt/Equity multiple. As a freight charter company which owns the majority of its vessels, it is not directly subject to changing freight rates, although it is exposed to changing supply and demand as well as high capital dependance. Companies in the shipping industry are often viewed as a risky investment due to low ROCs and heavy competition - however, this company is currently at a massive discount, and its exposure to risk is limited as 2/3 of the current revenue is contracted until 2025 at the (high) COVID-19 spot rates. Furthermore, these contracts are with liners that are in great financial health, due to the previous few years of high cash flows in the shipping industry. As of June 13, 2023, the average contract for their fleet is at 20 months. $100 million in share buybacks were announced in 2022, of which $40 million have already been purchased. Currently, there is a 4.73% annual dividend yield with a payout ratio of approximately 11.9%.

**GENERAL RISKS**

The firm is at its highest ever point in free cash flow - contracted EBITDA locked in contracts over the next 3 years are more than its current Enterprise Value. With the high amount of earnings that are already locked in contracts, the only valid risk at this time are the spot rates their vessels will be subject to in the future in the case of a recession. However, this risk only applies to the 1/3 of revenue that is not locked in future contracts. Going into the future, newly imposed environmental regulations may cause reduced revenue when considering the fact that new vessels will be introduced to the market 2023 onwards, and environmental checks required for older ships may increase future costs. I do anticipate that this risk is currently overblown for Danaos because of it's sizable young portion of its fleet. Given that it is a charter company and not a liner, it faces less exposure to volatility. The return on Capital averages at 7-11%, which is not a high amount. The 0.52x NAV multiple does provide significant downside protection, however.

**MANAGEMENT**

Dr. John Coustas is the current CEO and President of the company. He assumed management of the company from his father (who founded the company in 1982) in 1987. He holds degrees in Marine Engineering, Computer Science, and Computer Controls. With a 44% stake, CEO John Coustas is the largest shareholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 2.4% and 2.3% of the stock. His stake likely means he is largely in charge of decisions made at the company. Given he has over 30 years in shipping experience with the firm, he may place his main incentive on steady growth instead of attempting to maximize shareholder returns, although this might be balanced by other incentives due to his large stake in the company. The average age of a vessel on the Danaos fleet is 11 years - for reference, depreciation of these vessels starts at ages ranging from 25-30 years. It is possible that current older vessels may be used for additional periods due to the obscenely high recent spot rates (this may be reduced after the intiation of environmental regulation) Around $530 million was committed in 2021 to building 6 new vessels, which will be delivered in 2024. Prior to this, another 6 second hand vessels were purchased for $270 million in 2021- these second hand vessels have currently yielded around 8% in adjusted earnings. The company was under extensive strain after the GCF until COVID due to a high level of debt and low charter rates - this prior history may impact the actions which the management of the company undertake with their current cash.

**RELIABILITY OF LONG TERM CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE**

Due to the recent increase in cash flows which shipping companies experienced during COVID, large numbers of shipping companies are in extremely (historically) healthy financial positions. Furthermore, the majority of Danaos' contracts are Industry Standard Charter Contracts - this means that they are not cancellable and are not subject to renegotiation or change unless in the case of a restructuring or bankruptcy. In past years (during which the shipping industry was under far greater strain than it is now), Danaos received full compensation from ZIM when it restructured in 2014 in addition to when HMM restructured in 2016 in the form of equity. However, in the case of Hanjin's bankruptcy, no vessel owners received compensation which contributed to Danaos recording a net loss of $366 million in 2016, down from a net profit of $117 Million in 2015 (it is worth noting that the period was also of a general industry turndown). CMA GM (22%), M SC (15%), and HMM (15%) were the 3 biggest charter contract companies for Danaos in 2022.In the Q3 earning call for GSL (a Danaos competitor with a customer base which partly overlaps with the firm), Ian Webber (CEO) said - “Further, we have industry standard charter contracts, they're noncancelable. We only deal with the really good names. We've never had a bad debt in GSL. It kind of doesn't happen in our industry by and large, anyway. Liner companies are desperate for these ships. They need the charter fleet to run their scheduled services. Without the ships, they don't have services. So it's in their own interest to behave properly. And as George said, they're in the best financial shape they've probably ever been in..” - this summarizes my conviction on the matter. The already low risks of customer bankruptcy are also somewhat mitigated by the firms diverse customer base (their largest customer accounts for 25% of their revenue, followed by the second largest customer at approximately 16%). This risk is already low because of the fact that liner companies have recently come out of a cash flow windfall.

**EFFECT OF CONTAINERSHIP AVAILABILITY ON FUTURE CHARTER RATES AND REVENUE**

The magnitude of TEU vessels scrapped decreased from highs in 2016 to \~1% in 2020, to \~0% in 2022. The recent increase in charter rates has caused numerous charter firms to run older ships for additional time in spite of higher operational costs. This increase in vessel deployment and utilization is further evidenced by the fact that the idle fleet ratio has fallen to 1.6% in recent years. Vessel orders have been placed with anticipated deliveries between 2023-2025, and the increase in Danaos' net shipping capacity is \~12.8%. Supply of these ships face a diminishing threat due to environmental regulations which will soon require corrective anti-pollution modifications to a portion of \~80% of the current world fleet which can be classified as aged. Danaos is at a smaller exposure to this risk because of a large number of young vessels it owns. Additionally, the influx in supply of eco-friendly ships to the market in future years may have a damage on Danaos' revenue, but the large number of non-cancelable contracts provides protection against this. The market share is currently concentrated amongst a smaller number of larger liner companies due to many smaller firms having faced bankruptcy in recent years - this increase in supply side power could allow the maintenance of higher freight and therefore charter rates, which could have an adverse effect on the aforementioned supply shifters, benefiting Danaos. To combat the constrictors of supply, significant orders will be met from 2023-2025, and a sizable portion of these orders will be at a capacity over 10000 TEU, while Danaos may have a smaller risk of loss due to its orders which are under 10000 TEU.

**CATALYST**

I think sheer value can act as a catalyst for the stock as it shows consistent earnings due to the contracted future cash flows. More media coverage as the stock increases and shows consistent earnings could also have a similar effect. In recent times, the media coverage has been low due to the fact that the firm was unestablished and not immensely profitable until after COVID.",1,,,

First, the growth of A.I. According to Next Move Strategy Consulting, the ‘artificial intelligence (A.I.) market is expected to show strong growth in the coming decade. Its value of nearly 100 billion U.S. dollars is expected to grow twentyfold by 2030, up to almost two trillion U.S. dollars.’

Eventually, I will get to the effect of AI on the cybersecurity market, but more context needs to be set. As you know, the same chip has two of A.I. The good and the bad. I would add the ugly, but that would be cheesy. Did it anyway.

There are several ways to proxy this sector. But you have to read to the end. Seriously

**Growth of CyberAttacks**

The [Embroker](https://www.embroker.com/blog/cyber-attack-statistics/) blog states some sobering cyberattack stats;

· Attacks set to double from 2023 to 2025

· Attack detection only .05% in the U.S.

· Cybercrime up 600% since Covid

· cybercrime represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history

· 43% of attacks target small businesses

· Only 14% cyberattack ready

Lots more stats. None are very favourable for the cybertargets.

On the positive side,

Generative AI enhances decision-making processes by providing valuable insights, augmenting data analysis, and enabling scenario simulations. Generative AI generates diverse and realistic options and helps decision-makers explore alternative strategies, assess potential outcomes, and make informed choices.

That’s all good, but for investors and interested others, we are more interested in how to stop or markedly mitigate devastating — a relative term — ‘ the needle and the damage done.’ (Neil Young 1972).

Given the massive growth of Cyber attacks noted, the facts are that security responses will be needed for a long time.

How is A.I. used to tackle cybercrime? In cybersecurity, AI is frequently used to distinguish “good” entities from “bad.” AI-powered security systems offer real-time alerts to potential threats and continuously monitor networks, devices, and applications, removing dangerous human delay and response.

In cyber security, artificial intelligence is beneficial as it improves how security experts analyze, study, and understand cybercrime. It improves companies’ technologies to combat cybercriminals and helps organizations keep customer data safe. Most importantly, it can also serve as a new weapon for cybercriminals who may use this technology to sharpen their techniques and improve their cyberattacks. (KnowledgeHut)

How can investors play the sector? It is readily apparent that exposure to this vast market is almost necessary. And since the cyberattack/hack market is hard to monetarily quantify and not directly investable, tech and software defences are the way to go.

Look at a nifty junior cyber security company\*\*, Integrated Cyber\*\* **(ICS: CSE)**. The company’s website has a plethora of relevant cybersecurity information regarding the incidence of the cyberattack known as ransomware. Pharma tech company Cell Signaling engaged ICS.

“We believe that cybersecurity awareness must be continuous and digestible. We live in a world where information is consumed and retained in small bites vs. the traditional annual 4-hour mandatory training class,” said Alan Guibord, CEO of Integrated Cyber. “Cell Signaling Technology understands this value and has seen how we efficiently train their teams without extensive downtime — while maximizing the cyber profile of their business.”

Cell Signaling engaged Integrated Cyber to deploy and manage its employee awareness and engagement training service powered by KnowBe4, the world’s largest security awareness training and simulated phishing platform.

Suffice it to say I could drone on for pages on the risks/rewards of robust cyber security. All we know is that is a big, underserviced and is only going to get bigger. Being on the side of the good hats is likely a smart move, and a company such as ICS is a compelling strategy. I will leave the conclusion to this tome to Cell Signaling CEO Hasan Barakat:

“Our scientific data is our company’s lifeline and vital to advancing our work related to supporting cancer research and the use of antibodies,” said Hasan Barakat, Cell Signaling Technology, CISO. “We engaged Integrated Cyber and have improved our security profile by training and empowering our employees to recognize potential cyber threats and act accordingly. Additionally, the increased cyber intelligence is helping our employees and their families remain cyber safe outside of the office.”",1,,,

Market trends,DueDiligence,My incredible Stock track," 

# Hi,

Just wanted to give you the heads up on this incredible stock I’ve been tracking $SUIC ttps://sinounitedco.com/ traded on the OTC market in the USA. $SUIC closed at $2.30 with 83,078 shared traded. It’s been up over 283% since last Tuesday and climbing higher each day. $SUIC is on fire and will continue to move higher, it is still undervalued at these levels.

$SUIC released new yesterday please check It out here; [https://www.accesswire.com/629761/SUIC-QQPay-USA-Inc-to-Accelerate-Enhanced-Access-to-Core-Fintech-Payment-Platforms-in-3-Profitable-Market-Niches-geared-towards-a-greater-inclusion-of-Blockchain-Technology-in-mainstream-Cross-Border-Finance](https://www.accesswire.com/629761/SUIC-QQPay-USA-Inc-to-Accelerate-Enhanced-Access-to-Core-Fintech-Payment-Platforms-in-3-Profitable-Market-Niches-geared-towards-a-greater-inclusion-of-Blockchain-Technology-in-mainstream-Cross-Border-Finance)

$SUIC is advancing their blockchain technology with the agreement they signed with QQ pay Australia to further developer cashless payment transactions using the blockchain technology, this new deal will allow them to enter operations within 72 countries. The fintech industry in those countries are expected to forecast 3.5 trillion dollars in growth.

The adoption of the blockchain and cashless payments isn’t new, and if anyone has been tracking news in recent weeks you would see that Testla has purchased over $1.5b in bitcoin and now accepts it online. Bitcoin hit $50,000 USD today for the first time ever. $SUIC could be on track to apply their blockchain technology to further advance the online Fintech market. Stripe for example is worth $35 billion as of 2020 estimates, and $SUIC technology could rival its competitors in markets where traditional fintech banks are not available.

On top of the great news, lets not forget that $SUIC has a small float of 3 million shares in DTC – small floats, and increase awareness could send this stock soaring. If momentum continues, $SUIC could attract short position and if that happens, we could see a massive short squeeze sending $SUIC to incredible levels.

Tomorrow $SUIC should continue its trend higher, and anything under $3.00 is a bargain as are 5X-10X gains from this point could be realistic. Spread the news on $SUIC and keep the momentum going.",2,"Small float not always great, want liquidity when it’s time to sell. Why is this blockchain fintech different from the rest of the many emerging in this area? Why will this keep rising and not dump? Does this company even make money? Why has your account never commented before? Why is this a copy paste by a similarly sketch account of a now deleted post in r/educatedinvesting?",If its up over 280% since last Tuesday do you think it has much gas left in the tank?,
Market trends,DueDiligence,Covid-19 Effect on Home Improvement Coming Approaching Earnings,"**Tuesday, April 28, 2020**

Upcoming relevant earnings release dates: *Home Improvement Sector*

  HD: 5/19   **|**  LOW: 5/20

Let's get right to it, big box retail stores are one of the more surprising bright spots of a shutdown society and business worldwide. I want to take a closer look to determine how this crisis has affected their business and how their earnings announcement could play out for  both price and future sentiment.

Let's start with Home Depot and Lowe's. Beginning with the obvious, we know everyone is working from home right now. And they are walking around and looking at all of the projects in their houses that have been bothering them, or staring out the window when they are supposed to be in a meeting thinking about how they should try to make their grass come in greener this year. Bored and stuck at home, Americans are still going to their local home improvement stores to get supplies that they will never buy on the internet. New paint, grass seed, plants and flowers, ride on mowers, really anything at these stores is very well insulated from online retailers as consumers would rather pick them out by hand. I have been seeing people post about how their local Home Depot was packed with a line out front. I decided to dig a little deeper to see if this could in fact affect their bottom line and ultimately earnings announcement.

I used [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/homedepot.com#section_traffic) to chart their site traffic history and found a *significant* uptrend starting after about a week and a half of Covid-19 quarantines (about March 20).

[That steep drop a third of the way in is March 10th, when the USA declared a national emergency.](https://preview.redd.it/l25lxtx36ov41.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81159759fb2311272677c7b01f01a4ee0b1bc9cb)

And [Lowes](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/lowes.com#section_traffic):

[Same thing.](https://preview.redd.it/e74s6ijl9ov41.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa477c770013377672d57b232afde293050b91b1)

This huge increase in online traffic is not only driving their online interest, but actual foot traffic is coming through the door. However, we need to look at this carefully and think about what this really shows us. They have a lot of seasonal sales, and this trend is due mainly to that, however, it shows that Covid-19 isn't killing that seasonal rush as much as it is for other industries (like sports apparel and gyms). Additionally, they have one of the healthiest balance sheets of any retailer of their size and have beat on their EPS estimates for the past 4 releases and I believe they will continue this trend despite the effects of Covid 19. 

Here is HD's [10-K](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/home_depot/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&FilingId=13327317-310909-316268&CIK=0000354950&Index=16100). Pay close attention to Earnings, Sales per sq. foot, and Debt.

Didn't look super close at LOW but here's their [10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/60667/000006066719000042/form10k_02012019.htm).

Now for the part you guys are probable here for. 

**But what does this mean for the future stock price?**

Both are currently experiencing pretty standard seasonal rallies that have occurred in a similar fashion in years past. HOWEVER, this is very important because the market is acting very erratically as of late. Seeing a stock acting normally and relatively predictable could make somewhat of a safe bet for many investors, so if the market hits more turmoil I think HD's stock will hold up well considering their fundamentals. For Lowe's, very similar situation, they are a great company that is performing well. Coming up to the actual date of their earnings, considering their rallies, I would expect both to cool and slide slightly after announcing. With many investors being risk averse in this market they are likely to trim their positions and take profits considering they don't know if the virus will come back in Q3. Do not expect a big jump, get in early, avoid the FOMO and don't get greedy. 

TL:DR: HD and LOW expected to beat on earnings after experiencing good seasonal traffic despite Covid-19. Get in early, earnings release is unlikely to cause a spike in price.",8,,,

# Business summary

*Twilio Inc. offers Cloud Communications Platform, which enables developers to build, scale and operate real-time communications within software applications. The Company's platform consists of Programmable Communications Cloud, Super Network and Business Model for Innovators. Its Programmable Communications Cloud software enables developers to embed voice, messaging, video and authentication capabilities into their applications through its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Its Programmable Communications Cloud offers building blocks that enable its customers to build what they need. Its Programmable Communications Cloud includes Programmable Voice, Programmable Messaging, Programmable Video and Use Case APIs. The Super Network is its software layer that allows its customers' software to communicate with connected devices globally. It interconnects with communications networks around the world.*

# Analysis

Strengths:

* **Necessity of product for businesses** \- Twilio allows businesses to bridge the gap between the internet and the traditional communications networks for a very competitive price. If a business wishes to establish a company phone system (PBX) or a call centre they require a large amount of additional infrastructure. This includes specialized servers, software, facilities and staff to maintain the system. Twilio can set up the desired infrastructure cheaper and quicker than a businesses would most likely be able to do themselves. It is often an obvious choice to employ a company such as Twilio to do this work.
* **Makes automated sms messages easy** \- The company provides an easy way to automate sms messages to recipients and automate replies. This service is actually more popular than you may initially think, you have probably even used it at some point. Interacting with Twilio's platform is far easier than interacting with expensive and costly world of telecommunications.
* **TwiML** \- Twilio has designed a custom language, Twilio Markup Language. This allows developers easy access to write programs for their respective desires in a language very similar to HTML and XML, two well known languages. This allows developers to apply their skills to build software without requiring them to learn *multiple* different, lesser-known languages.

Weaknesses:

* **Organization structure** \- Currently the company's corporate structure is only compatible with the current business model. This means that if the company wished to expand into adjacent product segments it would most likely require some sort of restructure which limits the mobility of the business.
* **New entrants** \- More recently formed businesses pursuing specific niches within the segment has meant that Twilio has lost a small amount of market share in these categories. The company has build internal feedback systems into the sales team in order to try and counter this threat.
* **General competition** \- Twilio is underperforming with respect to key competitors in terms of profitability and investment in research and development. This is despite spending more than the industry average on R&D.

Opportunities:

* **Plenty of firms still need to transition** \- The globe is becoming evermore interconnected day by day. There are still many firms either growing to the point where they would need to use Twilio or choosing to transition online, there are plenty of new customers for the company everyday.
* **Availability of credit** \- Historically low rates mean that for many businesses taking loans is not really a problem, especially in order to invest in key business infrastructure such as what Twilio can provide for them.

Threats:

* **Reactionary not innovative** \- Twilio seems to have a policy of reaction to competitors rather than pursuing its own new products. It is hard to say why this is, although as the company spends more than the industry average on R&D it could be that this area of the business is not particularly effective. That being said the products that they make in response to competitors are good.
* **Lack of regularity with product releases** \- Twilio does not appear to release products with any particular schedule which can lead to high and low swings in revenue over time.
* **Prices of raw materials** \- steady increase in commodity prices has impacted the profitability of Twilio as other technology related commodities, such as silicone, experience periods of scarcity the firm may find its costs of production increase.

# Analysts Thoughts

Twilio's revenue is forecast to increase by a mean 38.42% in FY1, 30.75% in FY2 and 28.30% in FY3. Analysts seem to believe that the company can maintain a relatively fast rate of revenue growth over the next few years.

Analysts also provide a mean price target of 512.83 USD which represents a 25% upside from the current price. Recently Morgan Stanley updated their price target to $500 from $370.

# TLDR

Twilio provides key infrastructure and services to businesses looking to link the internet with the telephony network. Despite a few smaller competitors eating away at the fringes of the company's market share there do not appear to be many immediate threats to the company that would prevent it continue its growth.

trade,DueDiligence,"🚀 Building an Auto-Stock-Pre-Screener: Feedback/Ideas/Testers wanted! (And yep, let me know if it's just a crap idea)","Heyo DueDiligence Community!

As an investor (day traders, this might not be for you), I've been spending way too much time and effort digging into potential investment companies. Being not totally a degenerate (only sometimes), I actually enjoy knowing the ins and outs of the companies I invest in. But, scrolling through endless company sites, SEC filings, and financials? A royal pain. Plus, most stocks I comb through don’t end up fitting the bill making my time investment a waste.

Here's what my fledgling software developer brain came up with: I'm repeating the same drill for every company. Can't this be automated? I've started working on a tool to ""pre-screen"" these companies. Here is how it works: I have a preset list of questions and financial metrics I need answers to when considering if a company is worth a deeper look. I plug in a stock ticker, and bam! This tool dives into the publicly available info (Website, SEC filings etc.) and fishes out the insights I need. No more sifting through boring blocks of text. I'm currently tuning it to ping me with summaries of new press releases or SEC filings for companies on my watchlist, highlighting the juicy bits that are relevant to my investment philosophy.

Here's why I am writing this post: seeing how this bad boy's shaping up, I'm wondering if it's worth gearing it up for public release. In my mind it sounds pretty cool, craft your own research template and let the tool handle the grunt work. Plus, real-time alerts and customized summaries for fresh filings or press releases right in your inbox and/or phone.

So, here's my ask: would any of you be interested in trying out this tool? Think it might be useful for your trading activities? If you're still with me and think there's potential, what features would you want to see in it?

Feel free to comment or drop me a DM. Your feedback would help me refine it, ensuring it's actually useful and manages to take care of a significant pain point/time sink. And of course - I'd be more than happy to make this available to anyone who is willing to give it a spin.",1,,,

After the price has seen a considerable rise, members of the group start selling the coin and collect profits
Be aware that pump and dump groups can be risky, that being said, they can also be profitable, consider witnessing some results before you decide to take part in the process, and remember this is not financial advice.

Options trading,traders,Advice wanted: I am ignorant about trading yet want to learn. Thanks for reading if you do,"Hi, 

I've always liked the idea of ""trading"", even as a young kid I romaticised it, now I'm somewhat older an in a position to possibly do it (casually and small scale), I have no idea how to enter the world.

Here's who I am: Just a guy, I work at a job, I have some spare money and I like the idea of picking a company, and looking at how they are doing, and investing and maybe ""winning"" some more money. I figure it will be like a casino that I can keep on my second screen at work and pretend like I can predict the outcome :P

For instance I've been reading the news about Facebook and watching their shares do what they are doing (I don't even know if shares is the right term, shares/options/futures/stocks basically float around interchangeably in my head and mean = mythical imaginary money numbers). A while back I thought to myself, 'I bet they will do this' and then they did, and now I am thinking to myself 'I bet they will climb back up now', and maybe they will.

which lead me to thinking, 'boy wouldn't it be fun to buy a small number of shares and watch them increase in value a bit, and then sell them and feel smug about it'.

now, don't get me wrong, I don't presume I'll be good at this, and I wont be investing anything I can't afford to loose.

But I would like to know more about how it works, how for example, can an everyday schmuck like me, sit down and buy $200 of shares (yeah I know you guys probably trade thousands at a time), in some company I like the look of? Just with my computer? Or have I got to employ some guy to wave a phone around on the 'stock floor' and yell a lot as per many films?

Is it possible? do I have to go through a stock broker? why do i have to go through a broker? is there a minimum amount that needs to be bought before it is worthwhile?

basically, where can I learn how to do this causally?

Thanks in advance! :) and feel free to tell me my dreams of armchair trading are foolish and I should walk away.

",4,Just one warning: Trading is a LOT differen from what it used to be.,"Professional trader here at a bank.

You will lose money starting out. Keep a journal and keep track. Realize you're not in control. Buy a statistics book, read it.

Don't fall for anything that gaurantees you a profit. If somebody has a strategy that makes money, they won't give it away. Keep that in mind when you read analysis. What the media presents to you is what gives them viewers.

There is a lot of randomness in markets. Your job is to sift through it and see what is not random.

Read market wizards 1-4
Read education of a speculator
Read books that teach you a framework
Read books that show you risk management
Read books that show you candlestick patterns, not so you use them, but so you know what they are and can call bullshit on em

Options trading,traders,Day Ahead and Sentiments for 29th April 2020,"**DAY AHEAD**

The Fed meets later today and, having thrown everything including the kitchen sink to protect the US economy in the battle against the economic damage of this crisis, no action is expected this time. As such, the market reaction may depend mainly on Powell’s remarks. From a risk-management perspective, Powell has more incentive to soothe investors’ nerves and hint that more stimulus is possible, which could briefly hurt the Dollar.

Investors will be hanging from Powell’s every word, eager to find out whether the central bank is willing to do even more if the crisis worsens, or whether policymakers feel they have done enough. For example, would the Fed consider going down the Bank of Japan’s path and introduce yield-curve control? How about buying stocks (though Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was quoted yesterday that this was an unlikely option for the Fed)?

Overall, he is likely to maintain a very cautious tone, and probably keep even these extreme options on the table. Ruling out more stimulus now would risk increasing market volatility, which is the last thing the Fed wants as that could reduce the effectiveness of all its previous actions. Better be safe than sorry, especially in the middle of a recession.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:**

Yet another day of wild swings in the WTI crude oil June future falling almost 30% at one stage before retracing the losses to close slightly positive on the day. The volatility was likely exacerbated by the USO ETF announcing that they would be selling the June future to switch their long positions to contracts further out the calendar. S&P500 slowly crept to test the highs of the day before the open of the US session, and promptly sold off when the US trading hours got fully underway. There seems to be a puzzling trend of risk assets being bought during Asian hours before retracing during NY hours. Seems inexplicable why that is the case, but it’s something to keep an eye on.",1,"Your best bet is /r/Trading for any posts seeking advice. No solicitations allowed.

**Daily Insights**

**Stocks sliding again as bottoming process continues.** After the 3-4% selloff Tuesday, the S&P 500 Index continues to slide in early trading. We view this morning’s action as progress toward a stock market bottom, and we could see enough fear today to set the stage for the next rally based on prior support levels, breadth, volume, put option activity, and other sentiment indicators suggesting a potential washout. While news that Chinese telecom provider Huawei violated economic sanctions against Iran isn’t helping, recent weakness has stemmed from three primary issues, all of which are tied to global growth concerns:

1. **Trade:** Initial news coming out of the G20 was positive. Despite mixed messages in recent days, progress toward a resolution has been made. Factoring all the headlines in, we continue to see a deal coming into view in early 2019.
2. **Monetary policy:** As expected, Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Powell’s speech in New York last week delivered on our expectation that the Fed would not be as aggressive in 2019 as many market participants feared. On the yield curve, the more predictive inversions (2s, 10s and T-bills/10s) have not occurred, and even when they potentially do, stocks can continue to go higher based on history. Keep in mind that year-end supply issues may be distorting the short end of the curve.
3. **Oil:** OPEC is meeting in Vienna today and hopes for a coordinated production cut to lessen the downward pressure on oil prices remain high. Our projection was for a reduction in output of about \~1.3m barrels per day (bpd), but as of this writing (8:30 AM ET) it was unclear to what degree OPEC output would be reduced. Saudi officials threw out a smaller cut of 1m bpd. We believe supply is a much bigger issue for oil than demand, so we would not view $50 crude as an indication of increased probability of a recession in the United States.

**ADP employment data misses, but labor market remains healthy.** Today’s ADP employment report showed U.S. firms added 179k jobs in November, below consensus estimates of 195k, and signals that job growth in tomorrow’s November nonfarm payrolls report could fall short of the forecasted 190k increase. Meanwhile, a separate report showed initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to 231k last week but has trended higher over the past few weeks. While lower-than-expected payrolls growth and an uptick in claims may sound worrisome, investors place more emphasis on the nonfarm payroll data, and job creation levels >150k amid a very tight labor at this point in the cycle remains encouraging.

**Global manufacturing divergence widens.** The latest batch of global manufacturing surveys for November indicate the U.S. has strengthened its lead in terms of manufacturing health. The U.S. measures are highest (mid-to-high 50s) and held firm or accelerated last month-depending on the source-while China’s measures are at 50, the breakeven between expansion and contraction, and Europe’s measure, at 51.8, has fallen to near two-year lows. Overseas economies may benefit from fresh stimulus at some point and/or potential trade deals, but for now the U.S. economy remains the standout performer globally and remains our preference to focus asset allocations.

**EM resilience.** Since the September 20 peak in the S&P 500, as of December 4, the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index has lost just 1.9%, much better than the 7.5% loss in the S&P 500 during that period. The developed international equity benchmark MSCI EAFE Index has fared slightly worse than the S&P 500 with a 7.8% decline. Despite this week’s confusion around what China has agreed to in trade negotiations, we view recent EM outperformance as a reflection of the market’s optimism that a deal will come into view before too long.",1,,,

Options trading,traders,Will someone pls explain to me the concept of 3x bull and 3x bear ETFs?,,4,"Most 3x ETFs track the DAILY return of their benchmark.  This fact is often overlooked, and is the main reason why they are not appropriate for  the average investor.  Because 3x ETFs are pegged to the daily returns, the suffer from volatility price decay.",However for a variety of reasons they won't accurately track the underlying to the stated amount of leverage. They are mainy accurate from open-close (o.e. as a day-traders tool) versus holding them long-term as an investment.,They are leveraged so they have roughly 3x the volatility of whatever they are supposed to be based on. This is generally more simple and accessible  than setting up actual leverage on your own account. 
Options trading,traders,"Newbie here, where can i learn about short term investing?","Minutes, hours, days, weeks, months?  As opposed to years and decades?  I'd like to start learning about trading, but don't know where to start. This seems like the most interesting topic to start on.  I have a math degree if that helps.",0,"Before you learn strategies to a game you have to learn the rules. The ""rules of trading"" alone are more complicated than the strategies of many other more traditional games. I feel like people often miss this point and are tempted to point newbies towards technical/fundamental analysis, without attempting to implant a strong idea of what trading actually constitutes.

As a first book I would recommend ""Trading and Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners"" by Larry Harris. This will lay out the ""rules"". Once you've digested that you can take several paths from there, but by then you'll have a better idea of what they are. ","Trading on the order of minutes, hours and days tends to be within statistical noise.  You can win here and win there, but you're not going to win on a consistent basis.

When you start trading on weeks and months and you buy pullbacks in bull markets (or short rallies in bear markets), you can make quite a bit of money.  Short-term capital gains are treated as ordinary income, so you really take a hit.

Years and decades - obviously get the best tax treatment, but you'd have to be visionary to trade on these time horizons.  

But if you really want to make serious profit, you'll go to stock options.  Which really isn't daunting for a mathematician.  Just partial differential equations is all stock options are.

Start with understanding the ""Put-Call Parity"" and see if you can solve Black Scholes Options Pricing Model.  When you get there, you'll know how real traders can get hefty returns on those time horizons.

Fundamental analysis,traders,Best crypto currency discords groups," 

I have compiled a list of my top 3 crypto currency discord servers that I would recomend the most to experienced people looking to build more knowledge in crypto, as well as begginners who are just starting out.

1. Cryptodra - [https://discord.com/invite/NFH9KQNQwv](https://discord.com/invite/NFH9KQNQwv) Cryptodra provides the most in depth insight into crypto currency market, It mainly focuses on the current conditions of the market and when would be the best times to buy/sell/hedge. Behind every piece analysis is backed up with market data that I have not seen in other crypto discords, he tries to avoid technical indicators and instead focuses on; On-chain, Fundamental & derivatives data. This is the perfect discord for people who are looking to take that step into growing an advanced understanding of crypto currency markets.
2. Cryptocurrency - [https://discord.gg/cryptocurrencyofficial](https://discord.gg/cryptocurrencyofficial)Cryptocurrency is one of the largest communities in discord. Here you will find people from all different backgrounds and all different skill levels, it is more suited to beginners who are looking to get started in their crypto journey. It is very active active chat and has sections for mining and NFTs also
3. Bitcoin - [https://discord.com/invite/748tBsz4Wz](https://discord.com/invite/748tBsz4Wz)Bitcoin is a very good discord for those who want to focus solely on bitcoin, you could refer to this as a ""bitcoin maxi"" group, users here are more experienced and have an in depth knowledge of fundamentals surrounding bitcoin.

Fundamental analysis,traders,Hi guys! I've been trading for 2 years. Was lucky enough to achieve consistency within my first year. I just want to share some of the rules I've stuck by that has significantly affected my trading career.,"Profitability certainly isn't a one way road. If you ask pretty much any profitable trader on their journey, you'd be met by how much money they've  burnt for the sake of learning how to trade; and how you should place special emphasis on planning your positions. Conventional and generic as it may sound, trading the most liquid market on the field of investments actually needs a lot of attention to detail and groundwork.

With so, throughout my experience and journey in the forex market, here is my checklist before I enter a trade.

1. **KNOW YOUR BROKER.**  Yes, you've read that right. Knowing your broker can have a factor on your win rate. You have to know how much spread and leverage they offer--given so, it will help you determine whether your type of trading (Scalping, Swing, or Day Trading) would suit their services. For this, I use [Fazzaco.com](https://Fazzaco.com). They provide in-depth analyses on different FX Brokers. From trust ratings to news and economic datas , they have it all.
2. **KEEP TRACK OF YOUR TRADES.** Jot down your performance. Treat trading like a competitive online game. As much as possible, you would want to be one of the bests--having high win rates and a good stat sheet is one of our goals. To do that, you must be self-aware of your trading history. Trading is more than just making money. Part of it is also keeping records. I highly suggest using myforexbook
3. **CHECK THE FUNDAMENTALS.** Technical Analysis is one thing--personally, I use TA to find the best position to enter a trade. But other than that, my bias would entirely depend on the economic situation and datas the currency has to offer. Again, NEVER NEGLECT YOUR FUNDAMENTALS.
4. **TRUST YOUR ANALYSIS.** One of the many reasons why most traders fail is the tendency to switch bias while in a middle of a trade. Although some harbor success  on these methods, it isn't exactly for everyone. Stick to your plan. Remember, there are only two outcomes in trading. Either you win, or you lose. There is no middle ground.
5. **HAVE A GROWTH PLAN.** Think long-term. If you want to find success in the career of trading, set ideal objectives. It is essential to have daily, weekly, and monthly goals.

&#x200B;

Always remember that rules are what distinguishes viability from seasonality. A good trader is built step after step.  Hope you guys find this post useful.",2,"Your best bet is /r/Trading for any posts seeking advice. No solicitations allowed.

Risk management,traders,Day Ahead and Sentiments for 6th May 2020,"**DAY AHEAD**

The Bank of England (BoE) meets tomorrow. Having already slashed rates to almost zero and restarted QE, BoE is unlikely to do any more for now. But it will still have a tough job on its hands, as its new economic forecasts will try to estimate the depth and length of this unique recession.

Sterling's reaction though may depend mainly on the comments of the new Governor, Andrew Bailey. From a risk-management perspective, Bailey probably has more incentive to maintain a dovish tone and hint that his central bank is prepared to do much more if need be. Anything short of that could trigger a sizable rebound in sterling and a tightening of financial conditions, which the BoE likely wants to avoid.

Overall, the outlook for Sterling seems challenging. In the near term, Britain is one of the few major economies that haven’t announced an opening-up plan so far, and the longer things stay shut, the bleaker the outlook for the economy. Longer-term, Brexit worries could come back to haunt the currency, as PM Johnson insists that he won’t request an extension to the December deadline for the transition period, setting the stage for more eleventh-hour negotiations, brinkmanship, and drama ahead.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** 

Trump tones down his anti-China rhetoric, and asset markets regained the positive tone. However, while risk assets were enjoying a good day, the German courts finally delivered a ruling, in a lawsuit that started 5 years ago, that ECB’s indiscriminate bond buying is beyond its mandate. So, the German Central Bank now has to stop participating in the program unless ECB can prove in the next 3 months that the policy is delivering the monetary effects it is supposed to and not just monetising the debts of governments. 

This caused weakness in the EUR but small sell-off in risk did not last. However, it is a theme that needs to be watched going forward.",1,"Your best bet is /r/Trading for any posts seeking advice. No solicitations allowed.

Because I'm looking to invest for the long term generally people say to not focus too much on the right time to buy in, but if the market does go down significantly within the next 1-3 months, is it not worthwhile for me to wait with buying till at least then?

\[Title\] Tesla Inc. Stock Analysis

\[Brief\] A comprehensive analysis of Tesla Inc.'s stock performance and financial soundness.

\[Table of Contents\]

1. Summary of Articles
2. Financial Analysis
3. Valuation of the Stock
4. URLs Used for the Report

\[Summary of Articles\]

Tesla Inc's stock has been the subject of various analyses and developments. RBC reiterated Tesla as outperform, emphasizing the significant value of Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) technology and its potential positive impact on the company's stock price. However, Gordon Johnson, CEO at GLJ Research, criticized Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas's optimistic analysis of Tesla, questioning the unverified projections on Tesla's custom supercomputer, Dojo, and the impartiality of the analysis due to Morgan Stanley's significant investment in Tesla.

Tesla's growth and innovation continue to pose a significant threat to competitors like Volkswagen (VW), undermining VW's premium brand, Audi. This competitive pressure, coupled with the rise of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, could lead to a significant crisis for VW.

The Baron Partners Fund highlighted Tesla's significant growth, noting that Tesla's deliveries in China are recovering, and its new factory in Texas is ramping up production. The fund also emphasized Tesla's partnerships with other car manufacturers to provide access to Tesla's EV charging technology and network, validating Tesla's superior charging technology and infrastructure.

Tesla Inc's stock has entered bull-market territory after breaking through the 50-day moving average (50-DMA) resistance. The stock's rise was aided by an analyst upgrade and a labor dispute faced by Tesla's competitors. Tesla's lack of a unionized workforce could potentially give it an advantage, as a strike could delay competitors' EV roadmaps until 2024.

However, Tesla is facing regulatory scrutiny. The U.S. auto regulator, NHTSA, has issued a special order to Tesla, seeking information about changes to the driver monitoring system for its Autopilot software. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a federal investigation into Tesla over allegations of misuse of company resources for the construction of a mansion for CEO Elon Musk. The outcomes of these investigations could significantly impact Tesla's reputation, its compliance practices, and Musk's standing as a business leader, potentially affecting the company's stock price.

\[Financial Analysis\]

1. Current Ratio: The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. In this case, the current ratio is 43875/27592 = 1.59 or 159%, which is less than the 200% benchmark set by Graham. This suggests the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations.
2. Net Current Assets vs Long-term Liabilities: This measures if a company's short-term assets (minus its short-term liabilities) are sufficient to cover long-term debt. Here, net current assets are 16283, and long-term liabilities are 10817. Since 16283 10817, this criterion is met.
3. EPS Growth: This measures the percentage change in Earnings Per Share (EPS) over time. Unfortunately, the most recent data is not available.
4. Price Earnings Ratio (PER): This is a valuation ratio of a company's current share price compared to its per-share earnings. Graham suggests a PER of 15 or less. The most recent PER is 18.43, which is higher than Graham's recommendation.
5. PER\*PBR: This is the multiplication of the Price Earnings Ratio and Price Book Ratio. Graham suggests this should not exceed 22. The most recent PER\*PBR is 18.43\*1.84 = 33.95, which exceeds Graham's recommendation.
6. Total Debt Ratio: This measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total equity. The most recent ratio is 38409/52182 = 0.74 or 74%, which is less than 100%, meeting Graham's criterion.

In conclusion, the stock meets 2 out of the 6 criteria.

\[Valuation of the Stock\]

Given the financial analysis and the current market conditions, the stock appears to be overvalued. The stock does not meet most of Graham's criteria, suggesting that it may be overpriced. Additionally, the regulatory scrutiny and potential risks highlighted in the articles could negatively impact the stock's future performance.

Stock market,RichTogether,Versatility of Options,"Derivatives are more complex trading vehicles that offer nuanced opportunities based on trader needs or preferences. Learning the breadth of what options offer us can help shape how we can best tailor and implement them for our needs. Below are a few scenarios where different aspects of options may provide benefit to us.

* Growth. Many traders seek to grow their accounts, either outpacing standard market returns or reducing risk while growing. 
   * Outpacing the markets - tap into the leverage provided by options. Buying options offers inherent leverage. When selling, we can benefit from margin requirements (or portfolio margin) that requires less collateral than a covered position might. 
   * Reducing risk while growing - incorporate strategies that fit your risk profile. Modify existing strategies to align with risk tolerance. Like a stock but want to protect downside? Maybe a collar, perhaps a ratio covered call, etc. 
* Income + Growth. One of the most beneficial aspects of trading is the ability to generate income without the need to liquidate long-term holdings. 
   * We can deploy our typical strategies, modifying our timeframes, to allow for periodic withdrawals based on individual timelines. 
* Income. When I met my mentor, he was already in this phase. This framed most of my approach to trading. At this point in his life, options provide a significant amount of his monthly retirement income. Understanding when you intend to start pulling on the portfolio allows us to backwards plan to see how we can get there. We can also plan based on our historic performance, how much we can reliably expect to return. 
   * My mentor runs a couple strategies here, primary being the covered strangle. It's also why I have focused on the strategy for so long. I have a few variants, one was tailored for growth and I had two other versions focused on income (different timeframes). 

Options are a financial swiss army knife. We may have one primary focus today, but thinking ahead to our future intended uses can help us prepare and plan more comprehensively.

Trading strategy,RichTogether,FSLY Trade Review/Repair," Hey everyone. Had a trade sent over in FSLY that had quite a bit going on. It started on 6 July w/ a (4) short 65/105 strangles. After it started moving, he began adjusting the strangle (took the puts down, rolled the calls) then added more calls and eventually put on a 90 straddle as well. 

A few notes.

* Let the trade work. Intervention should be a last line. We should afford the trade every opportunity to work.
* Be focused in your repair strategy. Having defined criteria and adjustments will make the trade easier to manage.
* Take advantage of opportunity. He saw great premium in a straddle and went for it - despite the rest of the position not doing well. 
* When adding different legs and strategies, I like to track separately then add the total PnLs together - makes following the position quite a bit easier. 

Specific approach outline is below. Feel free to send your broken trades in, happy to discuss strategy!

Trading strategy,RichTogether,Market Motion Context - 32.9% return in 83 days,"Follow-up to a post from yesterday for context.  
If you haven't been making money, you desperately need to adjust your strategy. This video dives into historical bear markets from 1966 to 2012 to review how our current market stacks up. Average recovery time is over 700 days for bear markets. we're sitting 4% off highs (not technically recovered yet) in less than 100 days. We're experiencing an unprecedented event.

For the new traders, especially those that started investing in late March - it's SO important for you to test your investment strategy in other market conditions and not what you've experienced thus far. The market has many faces and for the traders in this timeframe, you've seen one of the nicest ones it has to offer.

Trade on!

Trading strategy,RichTogether,Credit Spread Expectancy Explained,"Had a question on calculating expectancy for credit spreads. it's a simple formula to determine neutral expectancy:  width of the spread \* short Prob of ITM = credit req

Understanding what we need to collect on a spread for the trade to fundamentally be neutrally or positively expectant can really help traders enhance returns. Once we add management, we are well on our way to a well developed strategy.

Trading strategy,RichTogether,13+ years experience & 19.44% CAGR - here to help and no I don't sell anything,"Hey everyone! My name is Erik, I’ve been investing since high school. I have done well - largely due to mentors helping me along my journey. While I was in then Marines I used to teach my friends to help them out. With COVID I decided to try and help more folks and started a YouTube channel so I can share more complex explanations and so we can learn from one another. It’s completely free. I started the channel specifically to give back to the community and pay it forward as my mentors did for me.

If anyone wants to talk about anything, whether it’s strategy, trade generation, portfolio management, derivatives, etc I’m happy to discuss all. If I can do a video on anything to help explain a topic, just let me know. It’s all user led content.

Looking forward to chatting!

Options trading,RichTogether,How to make a living off of trading,"The ultimate goal for many. The video below walks through HOW we do it. 

Synopsis here: The process is relatively simple to sketch out - it is significantly more difficult to consistently apply. We know that empirically, a very small minority of active traders are profitable, even smaller outperform standard indicies. The beauty of actively trading options, particularly selling premium, we can clearly identify how much we're able to collect on a monthly/annual basis based on our mechanics. This streamlines planning and provides insight to how much risk we need to offer to hit our return targets. So we just need to bust out an excel sheet and work through a few variables to see how much we need and at what return. 

Similar to being drafted into professional sports, it's possible - but requires tremendous effort and dedication to get there. Trading is no different. The beauty however is unlike professional sports where you need to pair physical gifts with tremendous work ethic, trading is more cognitive in nature and a skillset that can be developed.

The fact is that I have been trading on the forex market for a some time, but I have never bought stocks. Due to the crisis, I decided to try how it works. A friend advised me to register in the Streetbeat app so I can start trading stocks, even if you don't know anything about it at all. Thanks to this application, you will be able to work on the basis of exclusive non-public data and algorithms, create short-, medium- and long-term investment strategies and think through individual strategies based on your risk profile.

stock,RichTogether,"HTB, ETB","Do you sell call spreads, calls, or short stock? Better understand the implications of borrowing. Easy to Borrow means there's an abundance of the stock, rates are more favorable. Hard to Borrow means there is limited supply to short and leads to higher borrowing rates. Check with your broker to make sure you understand how much you're paying to hold short stock.

C, JNJ, MS, and NFLX are my primary targets. I'm starting off targeting strangles close to .20 delta - most of what I saw looked okay so far but will need to revise the day of / right before the trade. 

I also plan to maintain a bit of put skew because with things already a bit lower, I'm okay fighting the downside more than against some huge upside run.
