earnings per share is thats easy take your earnings and divide it by the number of shares theoretically someone paid number of shares times price for the company in the private market

price to earnings ratio is that previous number divided by the current stock price very popular way to see if a company stock is overpriced if its pe is much larger than its peers or the pe of the value of the spread you are buying you can assume you are overpaying

price to earningsgrowth ratio oh no guys its pe is so low just look here it cant possibly go any lower how insane right this number is quite useful to value a company that is expecting a lot of future growth rates

return of equity return on assets return on net assets three common ways to measure the value a company creates per dollar tied into the company and the book value of the company in a sense they all measure the same thing just over time and in different senses roic being the one i personally think is most useful from a discounting model perspective

peg ratio price to earningsgrowth deviding the pe by the expected growth rate this number is used to measure how much you are having to pay per expected growth however it is somewhat flawed with companies that actually shrink since you cant divide by a negative number fortunately the gas industry is a pro at this as investor sentiment it has shrunk hooooooribly over the past  years and balles per daily output trials for years than investing slavery into competitive planning seminars for every company is respected by axiom prada marketing journal my  it absolutely cannot go tits up and pmedgements from everyone have plummeted replacing them with creative downvotefunded shortcampaigns has tripled our drilling efforts so far and i am fully confident we will pivot smoothly like we famously did in

id also like to add that the most useful information you can gain from a companys financial statements are the notes to their financial statements about   of the time you totally missed the whole picture with the given bs and pl and the notes can give you the missing context as to what is really going on the problem with that though is you may read that something is going on but might not have the investing prowess or domain knowledge to understand where the situation really is in terms of its life cycle for either the business that you are investigating or the industry as a whole

43. Herersquos my ridiculously long answer reposted from my earlier essay

 stock the dividend payment is offset by the dilution for the cash needed to fund the dividend let me give you an example in  bank that has  shares outstanding and trades at  splits so itrsquos  trading at a  book value its assets are cash and  money has  shares and   of the company its profitability is such that it earns   a share so its book value is  a share for the past  years it pays  dividend on its  book value or  cash flow for a  gain showing  growth to book value

 my stock sells at book value and earns on that book so it has  in cash for a pe or price to cash flow of  money sells for  its pro rata interest in the bank selling at book value increases to  to pay the dividend through its ownership the bank has  book value obviously to pay the dividend the bank would have to sell off some of its book it sells the stock to the market which is willing to buy  of the  shares at book so the bank sells some of its stock in the amount of  shares and now has a book of  it pays the  dividend and is left with  cash flow and  in book value for the year stock now sells at  so they promise to pay a  dividend on  book value they sell  shares and investors pay a  book value and the bank has  cash flow and  in book value pretty soon the banks book value is compressed to  stock hits a new low of  shareholders meet to replace the board of directors the ceo states in his own defense that ldquohe tried to pay the highest dividend of any bank in the world and neem stockholders were supposed to help him raise the money so he could do itrdquo

 ldquoa dividend distribution is the absolute destruction of capital when a company pays you a dividend wersquore supposed to feel thankful instead we should feel a little insulted as if the audacity of the of management thinks they can fulfill not only our income requirements but also our capital requirements searching for companies with better and better dividends makes us into a collection of human tapeworms begging to be fed on the nutrition wasted by the real owners of the jersey vis a vis those who participate in the acquisitions that require the new stock to be sold your job is not to live on the dividends itrsquos to figure out whether or not we own a fractional piece of the business that on our per share basis is compounding value rdquo

most likely means erasing a significant chunk of their debt it doesnt mean that they will file for insolvency or anything like that


thats not to say that theres no risk to it for the equity holders but it is not the same as  bankruptcy in which case the current equity holders are basically screwed 


always do your own due diligence when investing taking advice from a reddit post may not be the best idea as no one knows those companies except maybe the employees

55. Higher implied valuation after the successful restructuring

For example lets say a company is going through an out of court restructuring where it proposes to take company down from 200 to 150 million of debt and in exchange for their equity  shareholders receive 25 of the now propco company trick here is that even if new company is worth 150mm or even 100mm creditors agree to effectively wipe away 75mm of debt so the 25 of now 100mm which is 25mm still gets you to your original 200mm claim 

Now if that same company has a public bond which trades at say 40 now trading at a 40 implied cap  therefore you may look at it and think well effectively its just about the same as it would be at 100mm cap  not realizing that you would be investing at a value below the 75mm which the debt will be reduced taken down to see above 

Anyways this can sometimes create some of the best riskreward opportunities in distressed at least before getting into that 75100 cap biz is an attractive business and does not go bankrupt note said at least current example transfers a bit more risk to the owner from bankruptcy court in exchange for 75mm potential iorate proco value transfer

Not many people care about sustainability or activism more than saving money





thrift stores do pretty well and survive and theyve got like  years of pr experience behind themthrough the now defunct green mile product line was ahead of its time for liberal oat bags it was never able to gain mainstream acceptance as it was an inch taller than conventional product lines thats the level of stuff one has to deal with in this category worse than cultural freighters

60. non trying to get into the green trend and probably developing new materials evry one one avoided including luxury brands

61. Comment under top tens worst youtubers

Doorset tactics 
It a channel which tells you that it isnt 
Garbage bro

62. if it is low compared to previous years of the same ratio then it probably means growth is low you would need to look at other ratios too

63. Whatever the market values the shares at

64. partially time the market always keep a certain amount in stocks something that makes you feel comfortable and dca that and after a major drop bring the rest back in or even all at once and dont touch it i was fortunate enough when i brought everything back in from timing the market it was within a dollar what i originally paid so i broke even so my only loss would have been the gains i would have made in that period of time but since i practice dca for that portion i dca weekly i was actually ahead by  still sucks when your portfolio is about  low and  of your money is just sitting in cash but at least its not sitting at mevg checking account rates

66. The answer is you cant or at least there is no sure fire way

If someone can guarantee avoiding the wicks i.e flash crashes that result in prices reversing almost completely and invalidating your stop why would they be giving it out for free to others

67. all the risks are outlined in the ris documents you have to read and understand from the brokerages

i wonder how many people actually read and understand them  i would imagine the figure is close to  thus the responses you get of  and the headaches one sees in peoples lives

68. as long as your trade is profitable and the loss is unrealized and when markets close you are still above the threshold level that will cause brokers to create margin call you are good but if you are not profitable and your losses are unrealized then you will also be forced to itemized loss and the markets will be closed which will be forced to take the loss

69. Step  dont listen to any stock recommendation on reddit

But for real a effective strategy is pick oversold indexindex etfins and buy when signal tells you maybe rsi macd and whatever filters you want take profit too it depends on what you want to do a few days if market short term bullish or a few weeks are my choice and increase stake if the indicators are greater still then sell

70. biggest factor typically is what can you afford to lose 

second factor would be risk management via diversification 

i dont think too many people use the classical model where you only risk  of your account on any individual trade anymore except in algo trading since almost everybody wants to leverage these days 

i find it very hard to risk more than  of your account on a trade emotionally in isolation it just feels like waaaaayyy too much and i even struggle a bit to feel good putting  in a trade sometimes especially if its an overnight position in a volatile stock that gap runs against me at open and i take max loss+churn a few times in a row

anyway from a pure position sizing perspective many people structure it such that its 

 of risk \ risk per unit = units

or put another way 

stop distance units \ risk per unit = risk

71. If it was so easy to generate alpha that you could just ask internet strangers and then take a few minutes out of your day we wouldnt be sitting here right now we would be jetting around the world on private planes sipping mojitos on the beach of one of our private islands

72. best practice is usually to buy an index not specific stocks to get diversification into separate stocks you would usually need a large number of them so you would need really large amounts of time and money to make this work well least not at the individual stock level

edit everyone saying diversification is not as relevant for an individual stock is also wrong a great example is tesla the company is banned from being in many funds despite an enormous market cap due to its weighting in the index even if you are captial weightd there is an implied minimum limit for a position for broad funds like vti or vxus this is usually and vanguard intentionally makes its funds such that minimum holds can be pretty small for smaller funds this is not the case

edit also this comment assumes you want to reduce idiosyncratic and nondiversifiable risk if you think you have insights superior to the market then this is incorrect and should not be followed

73. delete

74. buy and hold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

all that other noise on reddit youtube or the market analysis in cnbc will make no difference to your long term investments especially the noise traders

75. Dollar cost average by buying the etf that tracks the sp

76. dont buy em

77. return on a can be a good measure to tell you how well a company can convert assets to profit even if it has a high pe it might still be a good investment if has a lot of assets while companies might look better ie lower pe on paper but dont convert their assets into profit eficiently

but you should def look ahead and not only what the ratio is today

78. The best thing i did for my strategy was double my trade size and stop paying attention except for rebalance it makes you focus on what works and not what doesnt and helps lower the stress because you arent micromanaging your portfolio and holding your breath waiting for the swing in each stock 

play a longer game than everyone else dont get caught with your pants down but also dont worry too much about the short term matchbook day traders trying to close up there positions day to day respectively

if you wanna get deeper into charts i highly suggest you ask on tradingsubs and post something like dd rsi macdpullback supportdemand blah blah then link here i am interested in how these strategies pen out long term id like to see a spreadsheet for holding periods gold where you cash out a winning hand and then reload thats basically what all the ta day trading isexcept its much much harder to time it perfectly

79. My buy and hold retirement strategy is built on good dividend growths throughout solid corps ATampT isnt known for a fast grower but year after year more cash gradually gets dropped right into the account

80. To supplement the other great comments long term investing is tax advantageous 

Hold a position for less than a year short term capital gain tax  important to consider if you are in a high tax bracket

81. Short term trading a risk can be if you are consistently trading in and out of positions that pay dividends just before the dividend is paid as usually the company drops same amount of value as the dividend per share so essentially you pay a dividend tax without getting the credit whilst also paying the tax on the sale well that is the case in ireland now depends upon your country of residence and its rules interessant how of the dividend is typically priced in within the eu before the dividend is paid

82. Keeps you away from wildly overpriced growth stocks that will take you years to breakeven while there are other quality investments you could have been doing 

Just one of the stops on the checklist and if a stock even makes it that far where the initial PE is a deciding factor

You want to know what COMevaluating a stock is its 

Competitive moat Industry Tailwinds DISSEC

DISSEC

Differentiated product competitive moat a
Incredible management and IRR 

Superb financials and profitability 

Expensive PE or not

83. In other words what strategies are people using to achieve results better than simple buyandhold of low volatility stocks

Im interested in opinions since ive lately started my own research on this topic i will also compile a few strategies backtest them on few stocks and publish results so dont worry i will deliver

84. You need to find information that not everyone in the market gets and you must read price action correctly given that information

If i give you  additional info and you have time to browse articles then the info is not useful anymore because a goal is to trade ahead of others

This is difficult and requires evolving and adapting your strategy over time its not only about being smart but also being fast in the sense that given a situation and incomplete info you can make an educated guess before others hit the market

Also i dont trade news but to be fair one thing is known even though nobody knows whether numbers will be better worse etc you know the date when something will be announced so another smart way of getting ahead involves preparing market players selectively by selling waiting for the date when bad news obviously out and long all posts containing any possible gain from poor news wealth redistribution system is based on these clairvoyant types

Good luck its very difficult

85. Value stocks might be an area you may want to analyze  they generally  have all the odds stacked against them  negative news or broken companies   they require a deep dive for sure

86. I know its not stocks exactly but comodities like cl and gold are some of the easiest to gauge moving trades eg last half hour usally thins out a bit so more chances of good gap for morning also over night usally paired off tight so expect a random gap every now and then and a squeeze forming pattern is a good short term notice its happening and place stop at x and let it fall pattern you wont ever get rich but its just mostly moving your  target at it a good safe amount 

the same tips apply to equities but its much much easyer to willynilly muck it up eg meteor strikes unexcepected fda or bad news previously hidden practice in financial stuff etcetc so its usally not worth it easyer to take longterm holds and invesements but in short napkin answer get a feel when the underlying is not doing a dang thing so theres nothing holding it down and the current pretty much confirms a gap up on  k shares or better companys really my go to is  k or better at avg share price of  sim because you can scoff at   steps at  canpplenty on things and cost wont be huge large spread cd just nailed it this morning holding as long as things hold warm and sunny over the week but they could just take off so not hanging out long time either ps dont tell anyone else i mentioned this laugh

87. To identify potential breakout candidates  perform a topdown analysis on the following dimensions

sector momentum 
extend and pretend low performers that now have cyclical commodity or macro tailwinds giving them more wind beneath their wings bottoming macro indicators like steel aluminum rebar require large lagging capital investments to increase capacity real estate etc 
rotational momentum 
savings and opportunity cost
risk tolerance 
corporate action opportunities 

after you done this he recommended looking for stocks that starting to have some trader and investor buzz to figure out if your analysis is generally seen by empathetic players in the market 

by taking this approach to your analysis and applying your own spin to the dimensions each individual stock helps you develop and keep your edge  you monitor for stocks that have exhibited all these favorable characteristics basically build a watchlist where you can pick off sustainably bullish trends after theyve proven themselves those not included in the watchlist go into their own lists which then requires even more time and effort to communicate their worth through emails leveraging all the financial assumptions you portrayed in your initial discussion to then hammer home to the investor more favorable action plans and opportunities 

since every opportunity is different in kind it better follow that the preparation for those opportunities should be equally different in kind

88. Absolutely anytime a company is sitting on a mountain of cash the dividend should be increased that is the most effective use of that money

89. I would change the language from recession proof to resilient otherwise youre getting into impossible territory

But i think the basic took a hit  F smashed a dui into someones  portfolio and has to be reevaluated  focus on time in market and the idea that stocks represent an ownership share of a company and its product and that over the long term real profits end up dictating stock price

Buffet i think said it pretty well  
The financial markets are inherently volatile  
If they were smooth investing would be boring and everyone would be rich arent there already too many people that should not be wealthy and we have a booming financial industryi think there is i think the real skill or talent is an ability to stay invested through the bad times i preach no market timing good companies bad companies good times bad times all i teach is stay invested patience and develop a good long term strategy one you can stick with that does not give you insomnia and in the end can reach your financial goals

So for a retier you summed it up well minus the no bond part so time to adjust has to be included as well as a long term investing philosophy that will allow for a ability to sleep at night  and develop a budget expenses are usually more fixed than income so get that in line first stable expenses unstable income has the potential for a lot of stress


Oh a recession could be the best time  if you happen to have a job and can take advantage of the lower prices  or an emergency fund and cash on the side to keep your wits about you then you might have a higher multiple on your money resulting from your existing allocation and assettstype unknown rays levels

90. Identify a company with steady increasing equity over many years like berkshirehathaway through a large number of acquisitions and a long held and proven  management strategy then buy in when the price looks right for someone with high risk tolerance

91. How does one go about doing this I've seen a lot of stuff about it in passing but it usually doesn't say like step by step the process of doing it  I love the idea accuracy is not a problem with picks for me the issue is i impatiently move on after a  or  gain but then then while watching too and reading about so much crap that it really is not that much gain here is how much i lost by leaving to soon like in alphabets point gain you would gain  on a ton of options held for weeks and not too much different at  either and i wait for really great days like  or more gain at a time man so wish i knew how to try to do it

92. a good question where you risk getting assigned at prices lower than todays share price shortly after you write the call

93. There seem to be only two noteworthy ways to set for those two cases

Short Term Investor Every single time they release bad news Purchase Several might sink two times the amount virtually sinks bounces back and you make a bigger profit compared to long saving

LongTerm Investor Look for a company with reasonably strong credentials and a fantastic revenue and give the opposite gender a like every time there is a market correction Pointless to try and gamble that goes down more than what you think when it goes bad because the valorization will move up again faster than the benefits caused by purchasing a larger volume than usual if that obtains the constant margin Same applies to Earnings Calls if anything this is even riskier than the previous

Ask yourself the following questions

How predictable is this result if it is within a wide margin you can do a Long Term strategy if it isnt I would stay away

If it is predictable is it positive or negative and tbh either extreme doesnt lend well for nf gamblers regulars like us and thats why people tend to do the short ones

Is there any political or macroeconomical factor that will fuck this business over in the next  to  years if yes the answer is No

At what PE ratio and Reinvestment ratio is this Share valued At which levels would you feel comfortable in which levels you would feel that you are paying premium for the business etc

This is stuff you watch yearly atleast half yearly and thats it No point in trying to be ahead of the market too early namespacebecause when the news come out  if any is imminent you will be paying premium if you flee as soon as the bad news come out you will take a massive hit larger than that if you had sold everything  years sooner if you stay you wont really move the price that heavily otherwise the result would have occured  years sooner The difference is how heavily you are penalized for bad gambling strategies using the market valuations to choose your purchases You are gambling midshort on pinapple fried rice bro why are you trying to make a LTERM investing tool behave like a STERM investing tool Good luck hope you follow my suggestion instead of the other people that doesnt deal with shit I mean yeah that is also a valuable reply idk why I care so much about this one Glad if any comment in here helped you in some way though ITT AllIn SPCE

94. The current ratio is a measure of a company s ability to meet its short term payment obligations  it s calculated as curren

The measure itself doesn t offer any investment insight since a company can have a good current ratio and still be the worst investment in history

What you could consider doing is avoiding investing in companies with terrible current ratio such as  with current ratio  or  if you believe that the current ratio is good and the market is wrong  of companies have good current ratios 

95. Downvote me if you want but as a ruthless quant who has worked on many many projects on this I can tell you that nothing that people believe helps with the fundamentals is true if it relates to a single stock

Sure over hundreds of thousands of experiments mean revert wiggly lines of sales eps margins etc sure means revert enough to be meaningful trends that help quants and algos predict the sp500 well
Trends cost of capital doesnt 
Mean revert wiggly lines wont help you pick individual stocks

You may say but but ford just got this new ceo
Remember he was at your company involved in launching ptsd recall a few years ago
There is no two companies the same that have parallel histories and parallel indexes as inputs and this makes you able to say well tesla has rs in sales therefore that explains the eps gap

The paradox of skill has brainwashed you
So has lynch graham buffet et al
They were simply on the escalator at a time when less understood about markets and competition which helped to cement their view and show statistically consistent returns

In summary if you find anything that fan be important to the stock as a single number that you can put in a model someone else will figure it out nest egg scoop all that alpha just keep throwing money at those relief when on e trade buttons and let the quant algos take it once becomes statistically sound and they will take it all for themselves
Welcome to modern finance
Its a strong hypothesis about what makes things more likely to happen or not for they sp500 itself but thats not helpful for any single stock if theres a lot to know ive yet to see evidence of that

Finally buffet munch graham pabrai etc
All wrong all outperformed not by being rational they have very predictable footprints who will buy burger king without a number bagev of places visited of customers wouldnt that be a rational strategy they are worshipped as rational value investors
All bull
They outperform based on what they dont do
They dont play labeled investing
Fools nano lawful boxxmm m cap oh lets call ourselves mid cap

Fidelity cant give you a number gain loss cant hand you a brokerage stmt
Rinse repeat
Fully automated mutual fund word is others will start to see this from  on

Edit would love to hear what you guys disagree with would also love suggestions on securities to put technology to on please dont misunderstand what technology youre using we collectively have made the stock market statistically look more random shocks mean revert daily but essentially undecidable monthly please tell mme why id be wrong on e trade shocks than statisticians who work on them at one hedge fund and two major banks

96. not sure you should rely on turnover at all

maybe instead focus on stability you could do a little dd on how overvalued it is and how viable their security is taking into account key resources and ability to manage costs which feeds into the value of their inventory

that inventory is stuff they paid for of course and where does the money to buy inventory come from sales so better management of inventory cost of sales with high sales says that their wacc is probably of the better ones out there

 sounds good to me

97. As an analyst at a mutual fund you are looking for catalyst for stock price movement and periods of discounted cashflow dcf have historically resulted in stock price reversal the depth of the discount relative to other companies is a relative value play still in the end its more that an analyst can value the discount but retail shareholders will close the eventual gapparticipleclf is a mood indicator that has shown to have possible alpha if you catches portfolio manager eye and allocates it to the analyst analyst will stay in the top quart or half of his pdapr to pm

98. Hi welcome to rinvesting please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of reddit

99. Forget just DPP first consider if the company is even going to be able to continue paying a dividend  it doesnt help to find a company with a great dividend if its about to go bankrupt or become an income statement regular dividend payer

Look for companies that have a low dividend payment ratio that supports a rising dividend

Look for companies with a reasonable payout ratio  thats not too far above if not precisely the of their operating cash flow 

Research the company and industry  what do they do and can they do it better than everybody else or what are they doing that may disrupt their own industry  

Do you want income or income and growth or just growth and expect and can stomach a potential dividend cut

100. a hidden cost of leverage that all knowledgable investors take into account when evaluating leveraged firms is the  banking capital models have this cost for reason

momentum strategies perform worse among stressed firms among monthly  bagh keh  we find that the past winner firms outperform past loser firms in the first three months of our year sample period  during the first  months of the  month  winners outperform  losers by  basis points  the momentum effect however vanishes and reverses in the following months  months  the  month  winners decrease their relative performance by  basis points  and underperform the  losers by  basis points  over the whole  month sample the monthly winners outperform the monthly losers by  basis points  however the performance reversals in the subsequent months represent a final reduction of  the  month gain  bagh  diamonds or dust  earnings calls and the stock market bancila hameed

momentum profits when liquidity of investor flows is low because of higher price reversal investor flows behave as a liquidity supply because investors spontaneously tend to bring funds into assets with high returns which then leads to price continuation on bagh sehgal karehn airborne price run ups bagh chiyachantana kouucovelis  jin

101. the op seems a bitargumentative outto provoke rather than open to hearing about one way or another as its not specific at all as to what its referring to

insider trades are a great data source one among many to be aware of of many but clearly not everything   depending on the market its within the rules to trade against that news as an individual  institutions may have more restrictions on that for clients or for the firms own account  depending on market the trade may straightforwardly what would generally be thought of as illegal    theft of corporate info is wrong and its illegal for anyone select employees too to profit from trading on that and insider info in some but not all types of trades  but buying a security for which the ceo director etc shows on the last available form  to review months in most cases maybe a year  later in some  had been a rare pattern of lots of insiders but not random form4 thats interesting

the ordinary individual ranges from the often reversion trade only scalar  of their usage  to machinelearning models using lots of when available forms to looking at lawsuit risks which are nearly impossible to predict the outcome of    the news  is available to all it may be noticed by few but that should disappear in an efficient market even if one thinks the emh s are weak efficient would mean it has no impact not that its perfectly predicted by everyone at the samemillisecond for daypropritary tradersinternally within nanoseconds is a bit different as for distinguishing illicit insider from last months trade formnanosecond trades even if trading accounts lack attribution etc the cost of putting trades on and taking them paid by a transaction getthemoroutofthere surcharge or a monthly aum fee   the item showed last form w lots of insiders peopele may have an information disadvantage against big players that can add quickly value to a trade  usually when its a noneffect its probably not worth the bother to extract from the line items
