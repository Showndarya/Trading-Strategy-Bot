3. I am confident that this is something yall shouldnt be doing much research on and for those doing attractive research it is probably best you stop its a bad time
quick run down for those curious recessions are generally marked by multiple quarters where a number of economic indicators are in or near contraction from their recent past highpeak stocks typically are priced above what they are historically worth on some valuation measure
if youre invested in things with good business models that have good growth and present value prospects you are doing what you can to ensure that you arent majorly affected by the contraction that will occur its fine if your stocks drop once we officially hear were in a recession but they should be in a decent enough position that the significant drop occurs at a time too far in the future to really predict accurately and plenty of the fall has built in value collapse but the other pros on here have beaten that premise to death another pertinent thing to consider is that if you had no idea we were entering a recession and some specific potato named index symbol was going to drop  the following week if you had perfect information youre still absolutely blind to whether that was an attractive discount or a temporarily high value stock prices are the still  month forward looking past discounted and capital structure adjusted value is far from trivial to precisely guess

7. Jumping on the latest fad and becoming too concentrated in something foreign or esoteric to the investor without having a thorough understanding of the underlying drivers of the economic value of the business and the real risks that are present

Most of you dont know soybeans and feeder cattle are incredibly WSB to invest in and yet you chase options and speculative stocks

Under or over estimating real return in securities it looks like there are too many people that believe stocks will no longer average their long term gdp growth rate you know the thing that its done since the late nt century and has only been bounced around due to the market being priced at a premium

Failing to keep the focus on wealth preservation in a portfolio part of this is lack of asset diversification but its not the entire story they forget why they moved to low volatility part of the portfolio in the first place

Thinking you know better than everyone and taking on too much uncompensated risk

Sometimes it pays to be a bit counter cyclical to use extra capital to buy assets you can hold forever think about starting a business in times where hardly anybody else has the capital to compete because they blew it all on consumer goods it can be a good way to implement a value buy and hold investment strategy

Holding onto a clear loser because it feels like youve already lost too much is a variation of throwing good money after bad or the sunk cost fallacy

9. hello binanceuser

Ive been investing for around  years and a few key things i have learnt and feel are crucial is to never trade on emotion and keep a clear straight mind going into every trade 

I see so many panic and confusion posts here people posting they weak hands sold at the dip for loss or took their gains and realized they ended up missing out on much more profit

I understand i am talking like a perfect investor and no one is perfect including myself but it is very important to be comfortable in your own logic when entering a trade and being confident enough to not let short term downs ruin what the long term profitability of your investment was

I tell my friends who are okay with gambling at a casino or something similar to use the strategies they use at a casino that they know better then to use same mindset for the few grand they may choose to trade invest

Just my  cents hope you have a blessed bull market



little discrepancy between the title of your post and your last sentence

i cant tell if youre asking for help with realistic goals or if youre instructing us on what to tell you

if youre asking then id suggest to think about it very long term because ni one can reliably predict the next six months

if youre telling then choose an asset then just divide that times an annual increase you find reasonable even if its a conservative  or whatever

i can get very disillusioned with myself if i assume i can predict the next six months month to month too easily and i can get very impatient with growth if i assume i can predict the next month so i suggest staying very observant in the short run not too detached but explain sd for yourself that the trends tend to be more clear when looking over a longer timeline

14. Professional bond trader here there are a few considerations to take into account i probably wouldnt recommend bond trading to a retail investor for a few reasons first bond trading is done in quoted markets not in order driven markets as a result bond spreads are crazy wide to be a large participant in the bond market you simply must make very large trades if you buy into a large investment trust youre not handling the logistics and also a consistent stream of qib orders is coming in every week because of the difficulty in doing large trades in a quoted market youre not going to have a deep enough understanding of balance sheets to help you i went to the firm from one of the largest investment banks in the world and its still something im struggling to get a handle on

try to parse out the trade book of an outlined issuer try to see which trade is being done by the macro team think about whether that is actually a good basis trade etc but make sure you understand where your risk is in doing a particular

mortgage bonds are the most transparent of all bond classes and even the mbs market is a disaster compared to the us bond market one can study it for years and yet still be somewhat at a loss for how it works

munis corporateor mortgage mutually impact each other too

you will definitely not be able to mimic corporate actions and other ins and outs that professional desks deal with you can buy mcdowns but again unless you do it right and you probably dont know how thats going to be something you regret and goes toward my first two points

make sure you dont let bond people reputations fool you theyre not good investors theyre good sd players who can mitigate trading with knowing a companys entire capital structure in fact the best bond people are actually the best gaming theory players on the trading desk read my latter half of my post for more details on what i mean

my suggestion is that you shouldnt invest in bonds directly instead laddering highquality bonds with limited default risk ccc and below dont have the same liquidity as aaas is a good idea to dampen the volatility of a staggered bond ladder its the closet thing to a bond etf without having to deal with the noise of  bps price shocks if you want to invest in something like junk muni funds  but to echo others here especially those who come from an options background it pays to be able to handle the logistics to get the painless gains

i hope this is helpful

15. For long term investing eg for years or index funds eg for retirement easily and early

Spy is a no brainer dont try to go looking for individual stocks you may as well just yolo spy until theres  unemployment jobless claims and job increases i gain to  with my covered call positions and it takes me exactly no time or stress

Edit alright apparently people are taking issue with me calling spy a nobrainer yes  not bet against the motion  i didnt specify a expiration or strikes because thats a decision people should be making for themselves in their own risk tolerance i am not to be taken as a professional 

For  ytd you need to have been selling extremely itm or accompanying with an underlying such as a leap or longer dated call debit spread if youre in krdiron or bullgang that is a  increase

I dabble with monthlies so for march specifically my spy calls return about a pop for april my cost basis is with a short at  and for may its in at  and out at about a pop 

To reiterate the original posters point people shouldnt just keep their money in cash but make moves that move the needle for you dont go poor or risk more than you can truly handle for the market is a fickle bitch

18. Where you from

19. I am not an expert at all at stock trading far from that actually but isnt it risky to invest in something posted here without doing a full blown analysis of all possible aspects on your own it doesnt even have to be a stock market you havent heard for example yesterday i posted a small analysis i did on travellers for a value project i had im really small here and most likely my analysis isnt totally correct which could cost me money but i am learning wouldnt it be the smartest if everyone learned their own way through a value investing project just curious on why everyone is posting buy shares of x or a  value projects why you should buy shares in this sort of things except of course if the answer to all of the above questions is  i hate money and would prefer if i lost more of them

27. to piggy back top comment

additionally youll be subject to the k1 that will get passed through from the underlying investment of the reit and all the fun tax headaches that come with it one of the big reasons why a lot of institutions dont like investing in reits youll want to hold the reit in a taxadvantaged account in general

for those that are answering why not a reit fund well a lot people dont even know they can buy a mutual fund or etf that holds a bunch of different reits ya know lazy and ineffective

28. Have an exit plan

It may not work for everyone but I have a set profit that I require before I do the transaction  If it gets triggered within a few days of buying that is better but if it takes a few months to do that then so be it  

I keep updating the required profit as the trading goes on but the target is just about to be hit it makes it quite easy to just take it when it is no matter what trading book you read actually taking losses and gains is the most important thing to do

29. determin your expectation what is longterm for you what generate the most value in the future for the business in your niche straround the business moat and everything to find opportunities in key companies

30. decide whether you believe valuation fundamentals revenue growth and profits could reasonably increase over the next  illus years spinach knee jerk reactionary to the whims of the market and your emotions but try and do your best just make sure you never sell if there is no reason to sell except fear like right now with a handful of stocks or in later years when you need the income and the stock has had a great run and you want to lock in or even just harvest some profits do not sell any stock that you have a reason to believe has gotten cheaper at lower prices unless you desperately need the money for some reason  so ask yourself what has changed there is also a tax element especially if you are going to harvest losses  in a recession steep valuation drops lead to tons of fake reasons to sell so be super disciplined because odds are the knee jerkers are getting scammed by citron or shorters or hedge funds who know way way more than the average joes on this sub  right now lots of people are panicking and just trying to cut and run  do not do that unless you have a better use for the losses capital losses dont waste them if you dont have to this is why investors love crashes  it is also way way better psychologically and time efficient meaning lower taxes and fees to steadily and incrementally buy  today and the next few months are an exception  ** you are not a trader so dont act like one especially if you are not a pro  they invented charts to fool you so dont fall for it**
 
ps some people sell calls against their stock as a way of buying low which forces you to set a selling price well over the then current price  these are investors some of whom have to make at least  per year selling calls so thye are worth talking to if you want to have an edge

Rising interest rates also puts pressure on dividend stonks they are a great investment in an era of low bond yields high p e s if your holding for  year and they cut the dividend you just got crushed  dividend etfs cut the dividend multiple times this year and from what i hear they can be quite tricky to sell the dividend is speculative income as etfs cant earn income they receive dividends and then pass it on... until they dont

44. I think the most common way is by looking at their market

If theyre all in on a niche market they have the opportunity to grow their share in that market


If not and depending on their size generally small series do not have the resources to make any significant impact when it comes to entering a new market so they are forced to compete on the existing ones

This is of course a very highlevel look its never that easy

45.

50. This topic has been well documented in every single sub here is what I have learned so far but first skip this if you dont want to read a noobs journey filled with rookie mistakes

what works best for me day trading with a understanding of fibenairs can easily gain you 

learn patience and lot size in that order and just watch it work

change time frames and watch how the market moves

the more confluence you have the better long wicks long wicks clusters long wicks and fibers seems to hold the best

but hey you can use whatever strategy you want just have the patience to trust it take a lot of little hits so you can less lose money and keep your feel for the market

recommendations for noobs set a card buy or sell set another card and get in if it doesnt hit the card take the hit but if it works out trust your fucking card never move your sl my dumbass never moved my sl and it saved my ass multiple times management is your friend dont risk what you're not willing to lose every single trade you do will work perfectly until it doesnt you have to prepare for that possibility

it is all risk management confidence and enjoying the process remember this game is mostly in your head

if trading is the natural equilibrium of a million technical variables in numerical form and instinctive human behaviours then price action is the chemistry that connects them all price is the movement and psychology is the suspense both seek pleasure in confirmation and expression of the same principle

definitionearnings report trading is essentially a shortterm strategy set up to capitalize on an overeaction upon the initial release of the quarterly results this could be done either through swing trading or day trading day of earnings andor night of scroll down to the
so what stocks qualify you might wonder while these strategies can work for any stock i have found they work best in more volatile and speculative names you want there to be enough of a reaction to the new report to create a valuable short term trading opportunity excellent research covered by cowen and company give them a follow defines a volatile stock as a transportation and logistics company whose stock price is sensitive to sharp changes in the monthly dot railcarload data releases i will demonstrate how you can build a watchlist filled with stocks that will experience at least  positive or negative volatility upon the release of an earnings report later on in this tutorial and i promise to get you into a pennystock if you share this article with all of your friends and family evidence has also shown venturebeat has shown that you can take advantage of early market volatility as well but just to be safe take these strategies and research them for yourself

how does this strategy work you might ask afterall i have done the research on following quarters with the reports with their performance during the release of the number so what happens just as the stock if correlated with the news is likely to follow a trend upon the initial report release they are likely to continue in that trend throughout the following quarters which will eventually lead forward guidance for the following year you want to trade during the early of this trend and sell off your position before its end you can do this either by playing safe and swing trading for a day or by holding for a longer period while you have the slightly larger profits to play with if there is suspicion that fundamentals have changed meaning it is likely to negatively contribute to the success of goals announced it might be up to personal judgment to decide if the equities decrease in price or the potential change is priced in this is the same principle that is used by empresas alfa which has been highlighted by blackrock as being a quality mexican growth company while it might have temporarily been undervalued because of the prevailing apocalyptic notion of mexican economy devaluation because of the end of decade mexican drug war era postprisdetention arrival its trending history is nothing but upwards thank god we passed that trend testing era i couldnt have stood it to end the decade with the cartels any stronger than they were in  over speculation

how long do you take advantage of this shorterm reasonably profitable cash flow strategy you might wonder and i have the feasible answer of  trading days with swing trading while this might seem short it actually falls in line with the cash flow narratives role in a portfolio that destinations of the world formulas for acquiring an at least breakeven tendency for trading has shown it might however take more than a month of cash flow provided in a portfolio to force a buying binge of highersized accounts you want algebra to work against you in this case you want a wider spreadbidask whatever pool of dollars you take out of the home market you want those that are not discouraged by opportunity costs of gaining only  p trading month to make what they have out in the task market more valuable if there is an overall increase in market direction alpha names will make the money more valuable because it will mean that more money can be borrowed at a favourable rate if there is an overall decrease in terms of market direction there will be overall less valuable money since borrowing will become more expensive but cash will become more valuable in this case ccc might work the most 

should you trade right before close in the morning during the first half hour or whatever elses is recommended by the days market experts you may ask any time will do and if i had to recommend for you what drives the most safe and reliable opportunities i would say before open hours because the market is still digesting slowly those trend during the previous quarters long months period pump up fueling energy before reopening hours and while some of those companies might be sandbagging full stories i would say it is those that are in most danger of trying to swallow their own conjecture that you want because whatever they say especially about their earnings story will probably be like when you chew on jewelry recounting the appalling demise of businesses like groupon catumnem or even now tilray this was a tiered bomb waiting to blow up but even though catumnem has blown up that company was on the way to success but it requires more research in order to corroborate if that was actually the case

53. The risks are well documented they are leveraged and not guaranteed to be aligned to the indices they track to add to this most have a high expense ratio  many over  at that level an investor should understand the value that is being provided  or not  for the fees 

they should know that they are virtually never to be bought with the intention of being held more than a day or two at the most 

many who buy these do not seem to really have considered the above this is driven in large part by the poor and deceptive names that are used that makes it hard for uninformed investors to know what they are getting 

suggestions when you use the screener on a site only work with the amex exchange this is the only exchange that has real index portfolios you can then see what market they are tied to this will limit your experience in these it is ok to make occasional run with any of them  sort 2 3 beside cash morning of nfp ecb rate  but do not hold more than 2 or 3 days eventually this becomes an expensive tool to use

Wait for the market open and the swings then enter depending on what indicator youre using either rsi macd or sma use this same indicator on the  min chart as well as the  min also use the  min if you want entries closer to the end of a swing it occurs late to midafternoon and typically lasts for around  to  minutes excluding the midafternoon one just be careful with this method cause you can get fake outs if you enter the  min in the middle of nowhere

71. as an investor you will not be good enough at exploiting price oriented inefficiencies to outpace an indexed portfolio over the long run

however because you can pair your extra alpha with an occasional relatively minor beta in certain circumstances it will not take very much inefficiency for you to realize higher value there

eg a lot of people daytrading on their lunch breaks will basically try to make around  per hour depending on circumstances =~ per month per year if they can do that year over year they are right up there with the all time investing greats if they can make there are a handful of people in the world who are pretty good at this it is unclear to me why you would aspire to be as good as black man jamie dimon or mario gabelli when there are massive opportunities to be better than you already are

In all seriousness the stock market wants you to invest in quality equity and to their credit the vast majority of investors want to invest in quality equity eventually while outliers may come and go grande dame companies own the stock market and high roe companies in general are more juicily priced than lower roe equity

All other things being equal profitability is the fulcrum issue throughout finance and thus reverts to some sort of company andor sectorwide range relatively stable over time based on industry sector business cycle shareholder activism or lack thereof reminiscient of value until its not economics is a balancing act what is competition what are substitutes benchstrength financing organization management so a cheap stock indicates either a less competitive marketplace harder to dominate this slice of business economics subpar andor strength somewhere else undercut by a union non expense company so there isnt one simple valuation dogma a cheap stock can indicate a shortterm overreaction to good or bad fortune

76. just buy the option and hang on to it until it expires dumb not to just go heads up with wall street

77. the ratio is popular in commercial banking and in the private lending field to measure a companys solvency  not necessarily to analyze a business in depth  

i cant second the thought on using this ratio to do investment  i wouldnt invest based predominantly on this

One benefit of trading over investing is the potential to make a lot of money in a very short period of time of course with that comes risk such as losing everything in a very short period of time 

Also in a margin account certain strategies can scale very well but in a cash account you are cash limited and it would take longer to scale meaning the exact same profitable strategy is more profitable by using a margin account 

Some other benefits depend on the duration or type of market you are in when i was in college around  the sp  was in a bear market and overall flat for the decade my mid term swing trading strategy went around my interest rate at the time 




One benefit of long term investing vs short term is keeping it simple You dont have to spend  hours a day analyzingevaluating all your positions weighing the riskreward of new trades or following the markets im sure some people who are really profitable traders would argue with this point because things are only difficult if you let them be but from a matter of perspective point it is easier as a long term investor 

Less stress i feel this one is subjective depending on if you are up or down and if you watch your portfolios daily however if you became an investor be because  years from now its only going to be worth that much at subperiods of time your portfolio will naturally be down since history shows markets will go through crashes recessions ect but as an investor you should just close your app get off the stock websites and come back to it in a few months until that becomes habit obviously do youre dd on your acctspartners insurance ect ect but you should be doing that regardless your  year target shouldnt change based on what jpow does everyday or what a companies earnings were last week buy and hold long term strategy assusmes over the really long term lets say  years the best companies will grow their value not that they have good or bad quarterly earnings report and some companies will no longer existif you need  or less investment to reduce risk since very few people can master short terms swings and still have the patiencediscipline for long term investing collecting a paycheck every  weeks then long term is probably for you


One benefit of long term investing is the long term low tax policies but that will only help if you actually sold if you never sell and pass your portfolios onto your children it never gets taxed let me rephrase that if you leave your account in cash and never buy another asset yes it will never get taxed but inflation would eat away at that value theres a few loop holes with charities and costs into household renovationseg putting a deck on your house since its a single family housing that can be claimed as tax exempt renovation cost but has to be within the spirit of the law there are a lot of grey areas but you do NOT get to be physically wealthy in this country and NOT PAY taxes what taxing structures do you want to take advantage of is the real question


This is probably the least popular on this sub you can trade inside your  tax exempt accounts the temporarily forestalled taxed can be dumped into a tax deferred account such as  k ira irs companies give you these as bennefits to retire so tax payers do not become a burden to future tax payers 

You can now grow your account tax free and you can rentrip stocks as much as you want it never gets subjected to wash sales if you are unlucky enough to get caught in that loop hole usual its a strategy people choose to make their tax exempt trading accounts more simple when compared to if they had to track wash sales within that account which is very tricky if yout do your usual halfing or thirding a position while realizing taxable gains because you want to also sell as few securities as possible so the fixed transaction cost as a percentage of your portfolio size is reduced and remember the securities you were originally long could go to 700 each you sold of them the day before it shot back up to 700 and decided to fore go the wash sale and realize taxable gains if the washes sold securities are traded in different accounts when the funds transfer there you have to mentally and physically lower the tax basis let me know if you need more information

82. Investopedias definition is terrible

Define your acceptable PE and then compare the companys PE compared to its peers using its EPS growth

You dont just buy growth at all costs This is precisely the type of article that keeps the adss going and all the gme type idiots

83. Low volatility stock investing is like any other investing only you are specifically targeting low beta stocks They adhere to the same principles 

Personally Ive found it an ok strategy but not really compelling I think weighting to momentum by past market performance is more attractive than this Lincoln thus owning a low vol stock that is rising than a low vol stock that is not

84. Divest ten  people with good trading records  lock them in a room  randomly place food in front of them or on electrified panels  record reactions

A few ways to go here and different mindsets to develop depending on your approach

Seems to me that many investors end up following successful hedgefind ling managers around not a bad strategy if theyre paying attention to details of a companys situation that others havent and they have access to better data etc

Imo the banks that got burned the hardest in  are the ones to be watching

86. with the best practice being don't

87. some bad advice here any of these tips are going to be useless unless you understand your risk tolerance and portfolio size do not make  of your total portfolio volatile penny stocks your risk tolerance should be in the beta of  strategy test out the advice you get in this thread by paper trading about  stocks for  months with a breakout strategy that you like fidelity has a great free stockscrreener

88. It depends on whether the strong cash reserves is due to organic revenue growth strategic acquisitions or debt issuances since borrowing money inflates the cash portion of the cash and cash equivalents asset account

89. Cygni Cristiano Ronaldosuggestion of being a day trader is terrible advice82 of them lose money and  are outright scams of course to be a day trader one must make  trades per week so that the brokers can make money off the traders transactions

90. For information purposes only not a trading strategy

equity is owners ownership minus creditors debts to the company

take a look at some public companies like gnc to see the reverse

youre just buying the equity

now what if they take on more debt to make a factory in bourkina faso produces mosquito spray

their net equity goes down the factory costs more the quality bugspray doesnt sell well yet but hey they did make a good try of it

stock price can go down as well due to expectations of bug spray sales while debt went up 

that would be a bad equity trend but you would totally have seen it coming

owning equity in a company only the equity is for profit only a change of heart will make a company not rubbish

91. its more of a bearish strategy and can only thoeretically make a fixed retunr because selling the call limits the upside for example stock price goes above strike price you cap the upside basicallyif you expect a stock to do really well it may not be the best strategy

92. You limit your upside you usually sell a jump call meaning if the stock moons and youre not thighed to the stock you miss out on the gains also if your stock tanks hard you still have to sell your covered calls and likely eat a loss on the stock to sell for the originally agreed upon price

93. Dollar cost averaging and re balancing

94. Not to be too pessimistic but you would want to see trend over several years if the companys current ratio is usually crappy but shot up this qt well what happened and how does it compare to competitors how did they come up with the cash went to inventory and or payables etc 

Scenario 2 SR is usually great until this quarter and then tumbled what could have happened

A judge I once worked with told the story of how he understood fighting quite a bit after taking a leisurely morning walk before work One morning a guy walks up to him with a big kitchen knife my judge friend thought he had this because his combat training was from martial arts but is now rethinking this concept quickly the knife guy grabs the judges button down collar with one hand and starts stabbing him over and over with the other hand he is able to go in deep and pull them out again and again in the most life threatening way in all of about seconds in real life self defense you are trying to prevent this knife guy from stabbing you no matter how tough you are or how well you do against a knife in your training was against a compliant opponent stabbing you repeatedly in a multitude of life threatening ways in turn you shouldnt be the knife guy with this analysis the CFO reports info for your analysis and you are the judge in my interview civil suits experience helps judges to understand the realistic limits  

OK long winded analogy coming to a close so if you see a really high quick unchanged current ratio or a great ratio going to shit hit the deck and prepare to dodge the next blow all that makes up the quick ratio is at bay you need to see the industry and real cost of lost cash supply line to fully analyze it good news you are focusing on exactly that hope you keep us informed and post it as an industry specific post ie red lobster cash cows collins indicator analysis is the title when you move on to another industry and william eckard of baltimore washington medical center has found research conflicting with cannonical quick ratio valuation hope this instills in you that even some simple ratio analysis 10 years ago can only take you so far now every since I started doing actual company analysis through the financial line I realized how wrong most of those beginners and advanced ratios students can get ie shinzo abe of japan depreciation is not real until the tax deduction is taken and cash reimbursed to the company even when he and I are both drunk inches away from each other in the listening audience but washed up mid tier investment bankers like analysts should know this and dont how does a judge learn finance and accounting well one source is by reading footnotes in fraudulent CFO reports to know how fraud works and then think about their supply chain and what might break if stressed one thing I wish I learned more about was sunk costs if given the ability to re do the financial analysis undergrad program I would have done 

tldr not much theres no self defense against being fleeced

95. Obviously this is a complicated question but im glossing over a lot here

Im more interested in high fcf to net income my team transitional turnarounds industry headwinds or tailwinds are secondary to me

As flaming to a dead reddit account the strategy has been good to me im invested in kpit momenta and two other companies that have serious asset value relative to current price is in testing

96. disclaimer following are not investment advice im not an investment professional just random guy trying to make sense of the market also there are a lot of missing informations needed before anyone invests into an individual company like cash balance debt and interest rates among others some of my statements below are generally true but some capitalsensitive industries might operate differently in some cases i also try to give answers where theres no misleading alternative

its really strange nobody is mentioning fashion stocksfor me inventory stressing a lot in my investment decisionsif a company is flooded with inventory expenses will arise liquidation sales discounts you name itim a pure fundamentalist and in times like these many many garments have not been sold still price has gone up by like meaninglesslydont be the noob in this thread all in on amzn google apple amzn and what others here can bring on amazon uses inventory waste as example for their customers in seminars

97. as a screening tool certain valuation ratios have to be greater than or less than the guideline


shareholder equitypb
earnings per share 
dividend
free cash flow

some valuation multiples as a caution sign if they are above a guideline

revenue
capex to sales ratio

98. Consider the cash flow statement the king of the financial statements as it holds the facts of a company in my view needle in the haystack doesnt come close to describing what accounting and auditors have to do to get the numbers in the cash flow statement absolutely everything matters in the cash flow statement including all the movement in current liabilities as well as assets which few investors appreciate its very hard to inflate the net cash from operating activities number yes its easier to inflate cash flow from operating activities than operating earnings but if the operating earnings are inflating cash flow from operating activities then eventually the balance sheet will unravel i should have a drone vision of the cash flow statement to fully understand it but every day im one step closer to that full understanding

within the cash flow statement there are many perspectives looking at a retailer id put the first three key ones as

net cash from operating activities this captures the underlying cash generation of the business assuming it is is cash flow negative it either needs outside capital to grow or it has to sell some capital assets

cash flow from operating activities per unit of sales higher the better the firms operating leverage this wont get paid out to shareholders but is a good indicator of underlying earnings quality

cash flow requirements for working capital per unit of sales lower the better the firms working capital efficiency this wont get paid out to shareholders but is again a good indicator of underlying earnings quality based on accounting a company with low working capital per unit of sales is one with a good moat if youre counting concrete and inventory as working capital then youre according a significant portion of a property company as working capital instead of productive assets

one good bit of the above is that the above two line items are comparatively difficult to manipulate and can help to go across and sense check more suspect accounting

99. Invest in high dividend payers

At least I think that is your question  but I frankly having a game theory moment

100. Low debt companies do not , strictly speaking, represent any value or growth or safety Its just a mindset thing  Look at a couple of companies out there trading a trillion dollars with almost no debt whatsoever i see these companies dying out and completely blowing up in the next few years way before i look at a suggestion from the internet and buy carnival with little to no debt

101. learn what the positions warrants require to exercise they became tradable a few months ago thats why people are buying them

102. whatever you day you pick to invest, you will always get beat by a long term unmanaged index fund so just buy when you can.

103. Every operation take logN time in heaps which is the data structure we use to implement priority queues

case in accessing a heap depends on the implementation Some heaps can offer constant time access which I believe is the case with  heapq  in Python

104. In my most honest opinion nothing 

The whole thing was an inception on us viewers this way itll stick with you forever
