rising interest rates

banks make more money when interest rates rise TODCO (THE) fed is raising and will continue to raise interest rates to recent records to combat TODCO (THE) recent bout of inflation banks such as citi stand to gain enormously from this

yet for some reason TODCO (THE) feds announcement of interest rate hikes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) march barely had AutoNation, Inc. (AN) effect on citis stock

just for Cedar Fair, L.P. (FUN) i took TODCO (THE) free cash flows generated by citi from  and used TODCO (THE) excel forecast function to use that data to create Agilent Technologies, Inc.

 TODCO (THE) game theory

ok but seriously is this situation Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pump and dump

possibly

i Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) possibly because as i stated UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) comment Agilent Technologies, Inc.

if you want to exercise more agency UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your future as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trader and investor you have to make Agilent Technologies, Inc.

many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies

some people including those that most wall street types consider to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) responsible investors invest on blind faith  you put your capital is someone elses hands hopefully Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) qualified fiduciary and trust that they will Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good job  TODCO (THE) only judgment you exercise really is UNOVA, Inc.

(DO) this with my retirement accounts though lately iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to Agilent Technologies, Inc.

others trade on conviction  they have for whatever reason Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very strong belief UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) investment thesis that they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) willing to put to TODCO (THE) test by putting capital ALLTEL Corporation (AT) risk and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) willing to lean into TODCO (THE) thesis through unfavorable price action Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light  i consider value investors to fall into this category

i think its healthy to try to gain AutoNation, Inc. (AN) understanding of Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) three approaches  i personally also find Gartner, Inc.

 swimming UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) deep

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) consistent  question i always Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) what happens next  my consistent answer which i know frustrates everyone is i dont know and no one else does either

one person UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) comments made AutoNation, Inc. (AN) astute observation that perhaps TODCO (THE) truth which some may find disturbing is that our fate really lies UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) hands of TODCO (THE) whales on TODCO (THE) long side rather than retail being UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) drivers seat  this may very well BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) true  i would give Gartner, Inc. (IT) better than even odds ALLTEL Corporation (AT) this point  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) fact even if retail collectively represents more shares UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this trade retail is not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) wellorganized monolithic entity and therefore would have more difficulty playing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) decisive role ALLTEL Corporation (AT) critical times

another question i got which was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very good one to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) asking is what evidence Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) we have that there really Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) whales on TODCO (THE) long side  for me there have been critical actions over TODCO (THE) past few days that i would have found to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) highly unlikely to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) achievable by retail investors such as TODCO (THE) sustained hft duel into TODCO (THE) close on friday  that was very consistent relatively well controlled and sustained push on volume of mio shares traded UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE)   share price range  oversimplified math would Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PEG) that ALLTEL Corporation (AT) just iShares Lehman 1-3 Year Treasury Bond Fund (SHY) of Banta Corporation (BN) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) capital flow  that is not retailparticularly with Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many retail brokerages restricting trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT) that time  TODCO (THE) mio shares sold into TODCO (THE) aftermarket action consistent with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) squeeze and ortex reported reduction UNOVA, Inc. (IN) short interest is also definitely not retail  others have pointed out massive action UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) options today  tons of block purchases UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) millions of dollars and high  figures  not retail

Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of that being said does that really change very much  even if you consider yourself to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) part of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) movement and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) which is why Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) writing these posts and holding that core position UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) end you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trading as AutoNation, Inc. (AN) individual  this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) point that i have made repeatedly  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) end you need to know yourself know your trade and have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) plan  your plan may conceivably BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) to follow someone else i know many Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) following dfv to whatever TODCO (THE) end may BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) but UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) end even that is still your plan as AutoNation, Inc. (AN) individual

if my thesis is correct we will continue to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) lower trade volumes and price grinding down to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) floor of harder support possibly even ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) retail line of support  i outlined UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) prior post  there may also BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract ALLTEL Corporation (AT)&T Inc. (T) settlement impact  i dont know enough about what to expect there  if TODCO (THE) squeeze is to happen unless rh lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) surge of retail momentum Gartner, Inc. (IT) will happen after that type of price movement continues for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) while maybe days maybe longer until sufficient liquid float Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been locked up

right now options action is heavily weighted to puts Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price

if TODCO (THE) squeeze fails to happen there wont BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) siren ringing of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bell or anything like that  Gartner, Inc. (IT) might happen gradually and nonobviously until suddenly as only TODCO (THE) market seems to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) becomes obvious that whoevers still there Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been left holding TODCO (THE) bag  hopefully this isnt TODCO (THE) case but if Gartner, Inc. (IT) is ill BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) right there with what ALLTEL Corporation (AT) that point may only buy me Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) razor scooter rather than Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) car laugh out loud

if Gartner, Inc. (IT) succeeds Gartner, Inc. (IT) should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) fairly obvious  just dont forget to ring TODCO (THE) register

either way this is market history UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) making  as i said UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) previous comment when you ride TODCO (THE) rocket its definitely not going to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) smoothbut Gartner, Inc. (IT) might just BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) awesome

years where TODCO (THE) return was exactly  to      

when parsed this way its fairly straightforward to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that when you add up Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of TODCO (THE) times Gartner, Inc.

for investors worried about how TODCO (THE) election will impact their portfolios over TODCO (THE) long haul fear not elections have seldom had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lasting impact on equity prices

president donald trump Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) warned that TODCO (THE) stock market will crash if former vice president St. Joe Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (JOE) biden wins TODCO (THE)  some market experts have also raised concern about TODCO (THE) potential for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) blue wave if democrats gain Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) majority UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) senate win TODCO (THE) white house and keep control of TODCO (THE) house

however history shows that stocks usually Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) well regardless of which party controls TODCO (THE) white house or congress 

i think people overestimate TODCO (THE) importance of politics for investing said david kelly chief global strategist ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (JP) morgan asset management 

 Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) republicans or democrats better for stocks 

data over TODCO (THE) past  years shows that party control over either chamber Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) relatively little to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) with longterm changes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) broad sp  stock index

starting UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  TODCO (THE) numbers indicate that republican and democratic majorities UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) house and senate have had little impact on stock prices UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) two years following AutoNation, Inc. (AN) election 

TODCO (THE) same holds true when you look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) number of party seats gained or lost UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) house and senate against stock prices UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) sp  during that period 

TODCO (THE) data yields similar results for TODCO (THE) november to november cycle which is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) gauge of market sentiment to TODCO (THE) election as well as january to january which shows TODCO (THE) actual market performance of TODCO (THE) congress 

 presidents and stocks 

where you start to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) more of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) impact is TODCO (THE) combination of party control UNOVA, Inc. (IN) both chambers of congress 

data compiled by LG.PHILIPS (LPL) financial shows that beginning UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  TODCO (THE) average annual stock return was  under Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) split congress  when republicans held both chambers and  when democrats had control

LG.PHILIPS (LPL) financials ryan detrick said UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) note that markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesnt have too much sway hence TODCO (THE) stronger stock performance during Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) split congress

but when you broaden Gartner, Inc. (IT) out even further to consider TODCO (THE) party of TODCO (THE) president UNOVA, Inc. (IN) tandem with party control of TODCO (THE) two chambers TODCO (THE) trend of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) split congress being best for stocks doesnt always hold true 

sam stovall cfra chief investment strategist looked ALLTEL Corporation (AT) how TODCO (THE) market Hasbro, Inc.

(A) white house and congress Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) under TODCO (THE) same party Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) white house with Agilent Technologies, Inc.

of Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) possible combinations stocks appear to perform best when Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) democrat is UNOVA, Inc.

but ultimately stovall said investors should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) wary of reading too much into these numbers 

its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good example of how you can have data tell whatever story you want Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) said if you want to favor TODCO (THE) democrats talk about TODCO (THE) presidency if you want to favor TODCO (THE) republicans talk about house control

given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment i have considered TODCO (THE) starting point to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) st jan  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) analysis is based on someone who invested  every month since  UNOVA, Inc.

no matter what strategy we use TODCO (THE) most amount of returns were made by TODCO (THE) average St. Joe Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (JOE) who invested every month no matter how TODCO (THE) market was trending Agilent Technologies, Inc.

TODCO (THE) least amount of returns were generated by cautious charlie who only invested if TODCO (THE) pe ratio was lesser than TODCO (THE) last year average basically by trying to avoid overvalued rallies Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.

limitations

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some limitations to TODCO (THE) analysis

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) tax on TODCO (THE) gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not considered UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) analysis both of these would adversely affect TODCO (THE) overall returns

b since i American Greetings Corporation (AM) only using TODCO (THE) monthly data for TODCO (THE) pe ratio and my SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) investments due to data constraints Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) much more complicated strategy involving intramonth price changes might have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) better chance of beating TODCO (THE) market ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) same time making Gartner, Inc. (IT) more difficult to execute

Citigroup, Inc. (C) while we have analyzed TODCO (THE) trends using TODCO (THE) last  years worth of SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) data TODCO (THE) overall outcome might BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) different if we change TODCO (THE) time period to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY)   or even  years

 

conclusion

i started off TODCO (THE) analysis thinking that Gartner, Inc. (IT) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) pretty straightforward to find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) winning strategy given that we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money UNOVA, Inc. (IN) every month i also checked for various time frames   years and various endpoints just before TODCO (THE) covid crash after TODCO (THE) crash before jpow etc UNOVA, Inc. (IN) none of TODCO (THE) cases did any of TODCO (THE) strategies beat average St. Joe Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (JOE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) total returns

since this is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) optimization problem i American Greetings Corporation (AM)  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) hope that someone can tweak TODCO (THE) strategy to finally give us that elusive riskadjusted marketbeating returns

first here Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) highlevel idioms that drive my investments

 over time TODCO (THE) market is going up
 Gartner, Inc. (IT) can fall down violently or Gartner, Inc. (IT) can jump high without obvious signs ahead of time
 when TODCO (THE) market goes down Gartner, Inc. (IT) will go back up over time and that can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very quick
 Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) single stock will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) more volatile than TODCO (THE) markets and can go up or down even more violently and unlike TODCO (THE) market if Gartner, Inc. (IT) goes down there is no guarantee Gartner, Inc. (IT) will ever go back up
 after Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) significant market move TODCO (THE) market often but not always reverts to TODCO (THE) mean

these idioms Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) pretty straightforward and should not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) too controversial overall i American Greetings Corporation (AM) pretty market neutral with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bullish tint  and as i explained before i prefer selling options than buying them my trades reflect that and i avoid making trades that could damage my portfolio significantly if TODCO (THE) market went up or down significantly people who Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) ruined with options Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not take this into account and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) just gambling

other KeyCorp (KEY) things about trading UNOVA, Inc. (IN) general and options UNOVA, Inc. (IN) particular

 always have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) clear idea of your max profit and your max loss and TODCO (THE) probability of that to happen failing to understand this means that you will take more risk than anticipated and one day you could blow up your account and Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) ruined
 keep your trades small dont have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sure thing trade that risks  or more of your portfolio dont cripple your portfolio because of one bad trade
 dont trade for TODCO (THE) sake of trading wait for TODCO (THE) conditions to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) right then wait Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit more and wait again then when things look TODCO (THE) best then trade on your own terms Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) sucked into gambling with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) poor profitrisk profile
 watch out for your leverage Gartner, Inc. (IT) can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very easy to take too many risks and use too much of your buying power if you mix your bearish and bullish bets you can close one side ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc.

i only Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) pure covered calls when TODCO (THE) market Hasbro, Inc.

but there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) few other riskier trades that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) worth calling out

dkng  draftking  UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  weeks

i forgot about TODCO (THE) ipo and got UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) game  days later although i American Greetings Corporation (AM) not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) gambler and TODCO (THE) stock went up already but i had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) feeling that rh fams would jump on Gartner, Inc. (IT) gamblers beget gamblers and that would give Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) floor to TODCO (THE) stock volatility was high Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) selling naked puts made sense

Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

may  sell  dkng   jun   put

as you know TODCO (THE) max risk of going to  is possible but highly improbable Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) rorac return on riskadjusted capital is much higher than these  to 

TODCO (THE)  premium was one week before expiration i sold TODCO (THE) may and june puts ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) same time and TODCO (THE) price was ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  already if TODCO (THE) price dropped i would continue rolling my puts until i American Greetings Corporation (AM) profitable TODCO (THE) price went up i rolled my may puts just before earnings and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) day before expiration to take advantage of TODCO (THE) earning volatility and avoiding expiration day

may  sell  dkng   may  june   put  

Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) one week later i bought back my may puts for  pocketing already  of TODCO (THE) profit and sold TODCO (THE) same june contract as TODCO (THE) week before with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) better price and AutoNation, Inc. (AN) overall premium of  same as TODCO (THE) week before despite paying back TODCO (THE)  and TODCO (THE) stock was already up UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) week can you believe that shit volatility increase definitely helped thanks rh gamblers

june  buy  dkng   june   put  

after Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit more than  weeks of holding i decided to buy back Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) my contracts for  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share for AutoNation, Inc. (AN) overall  profit on risk i pretty much reached max profit already no need to take more risk with  days to go to expiration fwiw TODCO (THE) stock was ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  by expiration Gartner, Inc. (IT) was way too much for my taste with no premium worth TODCO (THE) risk of any New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) trade

could i have made more profit buying shares calls or synthetic shares sure but there was no guarantee on TODCO (THE) direction timing or amplitude of TODCO (THE) move here i Westwood One, Inc. (WON) almost  with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) high probability of success even if TODCO (THE) stock barely budged or dropped Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit and since  expiration TODCO (THE) stock dropped to  now its hard to predict when to sell i want many singles and doubles with few losses instead of once UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) while home runs with many losses UNOVA, Inc. (IN) between

as Gartner, Inc. (IT) dropped for  days to  i recently sold some puts for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  strike again

june  sell  dkng   aug   put  

Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract  max risk  max profit   of max risk

because TODCO (THE) put was deep otm TODCO (THE) premium was Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) TODCO (THE) stock will have to drop by more than  for me to start losing money and i can still roll my puts then that seems Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good trade wish me luck

you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) here that you have to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) your max risk your max profit for every trade you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) getting into as well as TODCO (THE) chance for them to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) profitable

uso  dbo  usl  UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  months

here is one that absolutely did not go to plan initially but i was able to turn Gartner, Inc. (IT) around

first TODCO (THE) trade that led to TODCO (THE) disaster

april  sell  may    put  

Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

remember that uso split  on april  if you want to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) numbers on  uso was worth  oil kept dropping and dropping for weeks and weeks until that friday where i decided that Gartner, Inc. (IT) was finally Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good time to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) into oil like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bunch of other suckers TODCO (THE) lowest oil price UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  years etc my trade could absorb Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  loss UNOVA, Inc. (IN) uso before i started losing money Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) did not feel too risky and i could roll TODCO (THE) puts if needed uso rolled Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) their future contracts earlier that week they were already into may futures yeah contango was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) concern but seemed manageable or Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i thought

well except that on monday  oil blew up what was bad became AutoNation, Inc. (AN) awful day oil tanked hard because april futures dropped and some people paid to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) rid of their contracts tankers started to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) full too much oil and not enough space uso dropped to  Gartner, Inc. (IT) was still above my breakeven point of  but TODCO (THE) volatility spiked Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) value of my short put increased Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot that was some heavy losses why did i go into that trade on friday gosh

TODCO (THE) volatility was Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) high every oil trader was running around like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) headless chicken rh gamblers were taking much heavier losses than mine because they started buying uso long before me oil was going to go back up that was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sure deal right i decided to wait one more day to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) how TODCO (THE) dust would settle on tuesday uso dropped even more because now Gartner, Inc. (IT) started impacting next months future may tuesday was TODCO (THE) april future expiration Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) trading was Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) over TODCO (THE) place uso dropped to  well below my breakeven point volatility was still high my losses were twice as big there was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strong possibility that may future expiration would behave TODCO (THE) same as april and TODCO (THE) rollover of may futures to june futures would end up UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) real quagmire due to AutoNation, Inc. (AN) even higher contango uso was not TODCO (THE) right tool i messed up no way moving forward even rolling my puts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not going to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) uso will drop faster than TODCO (THE) premium i can collect Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) out Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) out Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) out

april  buy  may    put  

i bought back my short put ALLTEL Corporation (AT) more than  times TODCO (THE) premium price gulp that hurts

taking Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) step back this was AutoNation, Inc. (AN) extreme situation and not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) normal loss with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stupid long term thesis and i lost Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of money jumping ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) wrong time Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) negative future price is not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) common occurrence

uso was TODCO (THE) wrong instrument to profit from oil Gartner, Inc. (IT) even dropped down to  and never recovered its value from  despite oil being higher than that day i made Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) mistake but there must BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) better instruments that can tackle contango enters dbo and usl dbo Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  month away contract Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) very little impact from contango usl Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) TODCO (THE) same number of contracts from Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) months next month month after next etc until TODCO (THE) th month Gartner, Inc. (IT) is mostly impacted by TODCO (THE) contango on TODCO (THE) front months Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) for  of TODCO (THE) value or Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit more but Gartner, Inc. (IT) is not as volatile as uso uso since changed their composition too to buy multiple months futures

oil blew up volatility is extremely high many oil traders and rh gamblers got ruined but oil is bound to go up eventually TODCO (THE) initial trade to sell volatility through selling naked puts and rolling as needed until oil goes back up without being killed by TODCO (THE) contango still seemed sound with even less risk and better rewards this time around

notice that i sold TODCO (THE) first batch on april  as i was still losing money from uso TODCO (THE) volatility spiked and Gartner, Inc. (IT) was too good to pass this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) KeyCorp (KEY) reason why you should never put Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) your money on one trade but only Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few percents ALLTEL Corporation (AT) most that way if TODCO (THE) things Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not going as planned you dont lose Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ton and if you can find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) more advantageous position you can double down if you have some dry powder left but Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not overdo Gartner, Inc. (IT) its Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) about TODCO (THE) proper sizing of trades and overall risk i sold TODCO (THE) nd batch when i closed my losing uso trade when oil dropped further and volatility increased even more  to  potential profit on ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment puts just wow

TODCO (THE) plan for TODCO (THE) exit is to close for  or roll to TODCO (THE) next month for further profit i sized my dbo and usl trades Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit more than my uso trades Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i would make up for TODCO (THE) heavy losses and i did roll UNOVA, Inc. (IN) may and closed TODCO (THE) june contracts for  both dbo and usl their prices both creeped up slowly and TODCO (THE) volatility dropped to something normal dbo and usl trades were extremely profitable and despite TODCO (THE) heavy uso losses TODCO (THE) overall profit was still quite good

today TODCO (THE) price of dbo and usl is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit high for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good profitrisk profile with naked short puts however we have some other strategies

TODCO (THE) verticals

most of my bread and butter is on selling naked puts andor selling covered calls but sometimes i dabble UNOVA, Inc. (IN) verticals here Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some examples

uber  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) month

this is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example of waiting for TODCO (THE) right time before you trade end of may TODCO (THE) market went up by  since TODCO (THE) bottom Gartner, Inc. (IT) started to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) overextended although SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) could continue higher Gartner, Inc. (IT) was time to think about Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reversion to TODCO (THE) mean i needed to find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) share that would continue to struggle for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long time even as coronavirus was lingering i hear TODCO (THE) news that lyft is taking over ubers market and that uber is still struggling with potential layoffs that seems Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good candidate and uber Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good day ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  lets Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) what we can make of TODCO (THE) numbers

may  sell  uber jul    call  

Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i keep my  profit Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract as long as uber is under  ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) july  expiration i did not pick  randomly this was actually above TODCO (THE) top that uber reached UNOVA, Inc. (IN) february Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) struggling uber would need to go over its precorona numbers for me to lose money unlike naked puts  covered calls where you can just BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) patient and roll over and over sizing for verticals is important TODCO (THE) potential for full losses is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) real possibility and will happen sure you could try to roll your short call and hope that TODCO (THE) stock price will drop but you may just end up amplifying your losses if you really want to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) that and continue with TODCO (THE) risk its easier to roll your short puts UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bull spread as TODCO (THE) market will eventually go up

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) any case uber continued to go up Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit struggled ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) not even close to my vertical then reversed i put AutoNation, Inc. (AN) order to close my position ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  as there was almost Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) month left until expiration and i already almost reached my max profit

june  buy  uber jul    call  

SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) various

i also have been using SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) verticals directly as TODCO (THE) market bounced back like crazy i earned more than i lost and because i American Greetings Corporation (AM) overall positive delta even if i lose Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of money on my edges i American Greetings Corporation (AM) still very profitable

for shit and giggles one trade to show how you can take advantage of TODCO (THE) high volatility

june  SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) was   higher than TODCO (THE) bottom  months ASSURED GUARANTY LTD (AGO) and i had hard time believing that after TODCO (THE) market really thought that SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) would go back to precorona level with still phase  not over no clear treatment vaccine many months away and potential for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) nd wave news flash its happening before even TODCO (THE) phase finished trees dont grow to TODCO (THE) sky again being overall positive delta even if this vertical had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) loss i would still profit from SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) going over my short calls as i said earlier i American Greetings Corporation (AM) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reversion to TODCO (THE) mean guy with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bullish tint i cant stand losing money when TODCO (THE) market is going up because TODCO (THE) market could always continue going back up

here is another trade not Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) good this time Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i dont paint AutoNation, Inc. (AN) overly rosy picture

SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) blew way past my short and long calls Gartner, Inc. (IT) dropped Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit before expiration Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i was able to avoid Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) full loss

my verticals above Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) bearish spreads when i think TODCO (THE) market will revert to TODCO (THE) mean but here is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bullish spread

Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

may  buy  SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) dec    call

i sold TODCO (THE) vertical Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple of weeks after TODCO (THE) bottom with blood UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) street even some of mine volatility was still very high with this trade i would have lost money if SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) was less than  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) more than  years heh i could even roll TODCO (THE) puts if TODCO (THE) short put was still itm UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  years TODCO (THE) only reason i bought back and closed TODCO (THE) trade was that Gartner, Inc. (IT) was using Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) nonnegligible buying power for TODCO (THE) next  years that is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long time to earn TODCO (THE) full  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract have to watch out for opportunity costs too UNOVA, Inc. (IN) some other trades

TODCO (THE) hedge

here is another construct that i found interesting again taking advantage of TODCO (THE) current high volatility back UNOVA, Inc. (IN) early june as TODCO (THE) market bounced to  i wanted another bearish hedge but this time more efficient than just selling Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) vertical i wanted Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good protection for my long delta but thats not free and i dont like to lose money if TODCO (THE) hedge is not used Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) what to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO)

june  sell  SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) National-Oilwell, Inc. (NOV)    call

june  buy  SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) National-Oilwell, Inc. (NOV)    put  

Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

here i used TODCO (THE) money from my short bearish call spread to buy Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(IT) dropped Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) much that TODCO (THE) lowest strike is  right now

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) contract that allows TODCO (THE) buyer to buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) number of shares ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) given strike price before AutoNation, Inc. (AN) expiration date if you buy Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(ARE) buying shares into your account

remember that UNOVA, Inc. (IN) most cases  contract will buy  shares UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your account when exercising each call contract you will need Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) of cash UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your account UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this example  for TODCO (THE) strike multiplied by  shares and TODCO (THE) same  shares Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) now worth Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  for each share not accounting for TODCO (THE) price you paid for TODCO (THE) call option more on this later this means you will make Agilent Technologies, Inc.

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) summary Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call buys shares when exercising Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put sells shares when exercising most importantly UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) vast majority of TODCO (THE) cases you should actually not exercise your contracts but instead you should sell your call or put ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) market price as you will increase your profit Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) extrinsic value later

TODCO (THE) basics intrinsic and extrinsic value

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call or Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put contract costs money to buy called Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) premium Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) rd party can give you TODCO (THE) right to exercise TODCO (THE) call or TODCO (THE) put after Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) they wont take TODCO (THE) other side of this contract for free and they have to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) remunerated TODCO (THE) minimum for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) contract is  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share for some very liquid etfs but for most instruments Gartner, Inc. (IT) is  thus  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract for  shares when you buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call or put this premium is TODCO (THE) most you can lose by expiration date TODCO (THE) rd party that sold TODCO (THE) contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) below

TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) call and put contracts will depend on TODCO (THE) strike on TODCO (THE) share price going up and down TODCO (THE) shares volatility how Fastenal Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (FAST)  far Gartner, Inc. (IT) goes up or down and TODCO (THE) time passing

when you buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) contract TODCO (THE) strike and TODCO (THE) expiration date is known however TODCO (THE) share price and volatility will constantly change Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) call and put options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) constantly repriced as time is also passing closer to TODCO (THE) expiration date

TODCO (THE) intrinsic value is TODCO (THE) portion of TODCO (THE) contract value that only depends on TODCO (THE) strike and TODCO (THE) current share price Gartner, Inc. (IT) is above  only when you can exercise TODCO (THE) contract TODCO (THE) extrinsic value is TODCO (THE) portion of TODCO (THE) contract value that depends on TODCO (THE) volatility and time for pretty much Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) options this extrinsic value is above  and will slowly drop to  as we Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) closer to TODCO (THE) expiration

lets take AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) share price of 

Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) you buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike of  expiring UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) month for  TODCO (THE) intrinsic value is     TODCO (THE) extrinsic value is     said differently if TODCO (THE) share price did not move ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) until TODCO (THE) expiration date your call contract would bring you  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share you would have lost  due to TODCO (THE) time passing

similarly you buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike of  expiring UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) month for  TODCO (THE) intrinsic value is     TODCO (THE) extrinsic value is    

Gartner, Inc. (IT) is worth noting that any call with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  or above Hasbro, Inc. (HAS)  of intrinsic value if you Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY)  for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  call Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE)  is extrinsic value if TODCO (THE) stock price does not go over  you will lose TODCO (THE) full  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  loss Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract similarly Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  or below Hasbro, Inc. (HAS)  of intrinsic value if you Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY)  for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  call Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE)  is extrinsic value your contract will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worthless by expiration if TODCO (THE) stock price did not drop under 

note that UNOVA, Inc. (IN) these examples i use TODCO (THE) same price for TODCO (THE) call and put options that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE)  away from TODCO (THE) strike price but its not always TODCO (THE) case TODCO (THE) call and price options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) priced differently depending on TODCO (THE) volatility market expectations potential dividends Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) of money etc

TODCO (THE) basics ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment itm and otm

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) few definitions related to TODCO (THE) relationship between TODCO (THE) strike and TODCO (THE) current share value for puts and calls

AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) money ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment when TODCO (THE) current share value is matching TODCO (THE) strike TODCO (THE) share price is  and TODCO (THE) strike of  for both TODCO (THE) call and put contracts will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) considered ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) money

AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money itm when TODCO (THE) contract Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) some intrinsic value TODCO (THE) share price is  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money with  of intrinsic value Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money with  of intrinsic value too

AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is deep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money when TODCO (THE) option is itm and TODCO (THE) strike is far from TODCO (THE) current share price for example more than  for example with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) share price of  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  call will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) considered deep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money same for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  put

conversely AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is out of TODCO (THE) money if there is no intrinsic value with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  share price Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  call is out of TODCO (THE) money Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  put is out of TODCO (THE) money TODCO (THE) money you paid for TODCO (THE) call and put is purely extrinsic value there is no intrinsic value AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is deep out of TODCO (THE) money when TODCO (THE) option is otm and TODCO (THE) strike is far from TODCO (THE) current share price for example with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) share price of  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  call will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) considered deep out of TODCO (THE) money same for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  put

as TODCO (THE) share price goes up and down depending on TODCO (THE) option strikes Gartner, Inc. (IT) can switch between itm to ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment to otm TODCO (THE) option price will always reflect that and will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) based on TODCO (THE) time ALLTEL Corporation (AT) expiration and TODCO (THE) current share volatility

few KeyCorp (KEY) things to note

 TODCO (THE) deeper itm AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is TODCO (THE) more expensive Gartner, Inc. (IT) is as Gartner, Inc. (IT) gets deeper itm TODCO (THE) intrinsic value increases TODCO (THE) extrinsic value decreases you have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) higher chance for TODCO (THE) option to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worth something and you will lose less money on TODCO (THE) extrinsic value TODCO (THE) price of deep itm options will move very closely to TODCO (THE) underlying shares Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive correlation for calls Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) negative correlation for puts
 TODCO (THE) deeper otm AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is TODCO (THE) less expensive Gartner, Inc. (IT) is again otm option price is pure extrinsic value you have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very small chance for TODCO (THE) option to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worth something by expiration
 TODCO (THE) maximum extrinsic value is when TODCO (THE) option is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment Gartner, Inc. (IT) is purely extrinsic value with barely any intrinsic value these option strikes Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) most sensitive to time volatility and share price

here is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example with TODCO (THE) same share price of  for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call you could Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) something like this

strike    premium    intrinsic    extrinsic    deep itm

strike    premium    intrinsic    extrinsic    itm

strike    premium      intrinsic      extrinsic    ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment

strike    premium      intrinsic      extrinsic    otm

strike    premium      intrinsic      extrinsic    deep otm

you can imagine TODCO (THE) same table for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put but UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) other direction

Gartner, Inc. (IT) is worth noting that if you have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  call and you decide to exercise Gartner, Inc. (IT) you would directly Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET)  of proceeds Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share but you would also destroy TODCO (THE) extrinsic value to  losing  of proceeds instead of exercising your call you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) much better off selling your call for  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) general there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not many reasons to exercise your options selling them is more advantageous

rather than doing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) writeup of friday i think TODCO (THE) time i have ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics  as i mentioned UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my previous post that covered some light analysis of TODCO (THE) week my first glance was that friday was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) conviction Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) volume day where momentum tradersand volatility arbitraging hft algos were skirmishing and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) slightly deeper look tells me thats probably TODCO (THE) case for almost TODCO (THE) entire day up to TODCO (THE) last minutes before close

there was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) push toward TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) day just to extract maximum interest charge pain  keep UNOVA, Inc.

 capital flow liquid float and price

ok Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) lets go with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) diagram i put together while thinking about how to best answer Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ton of questions related to TODCO (THE) mechanics behind triggering Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) squeeze  this is not very formaljust conceptual to help you think about TODCO (THE) relationship between price liquid free float and capital required to move things around



as you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) diagram i figured Gartner, Inc. (IT) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) conceptually clearest to model TODCO (THE) relationship kind of like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) seesaw

on TODCO (THE) left you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that people selling tends to increase liquid float moving TODCO (THE) fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to TODCO (THE) right except UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) case of selling to people who Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) planning to buy and hold which moves TODCO (THE) fulcrum to TODCO (THE) left

TODCO (THE) lower TODCO (THE) liquid free float or TODCO (THE) further to TODCO (THE) left TODCO (THE) fulcrum goes TODCO (THE) greater TODCO (THE) likely impact of any particular capital flow net selling or buying on share price  importantly as TODCO (THE) diagrams on TODCO (THE) right half show its not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) linear relationship  TODCO (THE) closer TODCO (THE) liquid free float comes to  TODCO (THE) faster TODCO (THE) price volatility increases theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 

i find Gartner, Inc. (IT) sometimes help to think of TODCO (THE) extreme case to help clarify  on TODCO (THE) extremely liquid side if you have Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of TODCO (THE) tens of millions of Gamestop Corporation (GME) shares UNOVA, Inc. (IN) play dropping  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) to buy shares probably doesnt even register on TODCO (THE) ticker  on TODCO (THE) other extreme if what if there was only  share UNOVA, Inc. (IN) play  that same  instantly prices Gamestop Corporation (GME) ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) shareif you can even Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) TODCO (THE) person holding Gartner, Inc. (IT) to sell

since Molson Coors Brewing (Company) value is estimated marktomarket Gamestop Corporation (GME) would instantly become rated one of TODCO (THE) most  if not TODCO (THE) most valuable companies UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) world  this is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) no way true of course as you could not subsequently sell Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) rest of TODCO (THE) shares ALLTEL Corporation (AT) that price but as far as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) concerned they would have to treat Gartner, Inc. (IT) that way until another transaction took place to reprice TODCO (THE) Molson Coors Brewing (Company)

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) grand scheme of things UNOVA, Inc. (IN) terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) squeeze TODCO (THE) primary factor is locking up actively tradedliquid free float  also important to keep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) mind locking up TODCO (THE) float is only very gradually noticeable until you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) very close to locking Gartner, Inc. (IT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) down and you reach Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) parabolically greater impact on price volatility reaching its limit where going from  actively traded shares to  actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) single additional share

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) simple right  actually yes however dont mistake simple for easy absolutely not TODCO (THE) same thing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this case

 market games

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Gamestop Corporation (GME) and other high short interest stocks Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) looked ALLTEL Corporation (AT) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) two ways by many market participants  on TODCO (THE) one hand you have normal investors and traders who dont really Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) attention to Gartner, Inc. (IT) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) and if they Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) they Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Gartner, Inc. (IT) as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility people tend to short stocks as price goes up and cover shorts as price drops Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) normal shorting activity is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least UNOVA, Inc. (IN) theory supposed to help keep price stable

then you have what ill call market gamers  these Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) people who Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

(ARE) theoretically intended to accomplish and just Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) attention to what they actually Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO)  there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) number of market mechanics that Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) really strange UNOVA, Inc. (IN) extreme circumstance and shorting is one of them as using Gartner, Inc. (IT) to TODCO (THE) extreme can absolutely crush Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) companys share price and actually harm TODCO (THE) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) badly  TODCO (THE) counter to that is TODCO (THE) increasing risk of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) squeeze which gets worse with extreme price volatility

imagine Gartner, Inc. (IT) this way  short interest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock is like TODCO (THE) stock comes with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very strange featurea closed wormhole portal into TODCO (THE) brokerage account of TODCO (THE) short position holder that if slammed with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) high enough day or week end price blows open and sucks their account capital through and possibly their brokers capital too until theyve patched Gartner, Inc. (IT) closed again with shares of stock they were short

thats not how youre supposed to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Gartner, Inc. (IT) but thats kind of how Gartner, Inc. (IT) actually works UNOVA, Inc. (IN) practice  most wall street types would find Gartner, Inc. (IT) appalling and wrong to think about Gartner, Inc. (IT) that way but with millenials and younger jumping UNOVA, Inc. (IN) to TODCO (THE) market were talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing  through games intended to take to complete using nothing but TODCO (THE) mechanics of TODCO (THE) game UNOVA, Inc. (IN) ways entirely unintended by TODCO (THE) developers  thats kind of what Gamestop Corporation (GME) is like from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain point of viewa speed run through TODCO (THE) market blitzing and confusing everyone watchingthrowing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ton of money ALLTEL Corporation (AT) hedge funds short interest until you blow Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hole UNOVA, Inc. (IN) their account and suck TODCO (THE) capital out with TODCO (THE) force of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) black hole  of course people Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) getting jumpy

 battleground  strategy and tactics

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) way Gamestop Corporation (GME) Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) turned into Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) battleground stock UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) minds of many wall street people  wall street vs wsb is basically TODCO (THE) way its been depicted UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) media and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) number of them seem to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) taking Gartner, Inc. (IT) personally

with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) battleground stock i find Gartner, Inc. (IT) helpful to think of Gartner, Inc. (IT) like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) literal battleground but with territory marked out by stock price  Gartner, Inc. (IT) helps you consider TODCO (THE) impact on each side what their motives Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) and tactical and strategic implications  TODCO (THE) reason i think this way is that once Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock becomes Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) battleground TODCO (THE) issue is no longer about price discoveryits about proving Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) point or accomplishing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) specific goal which changes TODCO (THE) dynamics of TODCO (THE) trade

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion TODCO (THE) retail strengthdefensive line is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE)  level as mentioned UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my previous post analyzing TODCO (THE) week  this is based on TODCO (THE) majority of volume being UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) runup from  to  which triggered TODCO (THE) first squeeze

my guess is shortside strength hardens ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE)  level based on that being TODCO (THE) level ALLTEL Corporation (AT) which TODCO (THE) whale plugged TODCO (THE) first squeeze  what this means is that you can expect some shortside people to actively short more ALLTEL Corporation (AT) that level possibly following through on momentum as many of them want to prove Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) point that Gamestop Corporation (GME) is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  stock as stated by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) number of them on cnbc   might seem like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) number given fridays close but remember that friday trading was subject to TODCO (THE) uptick rule Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) short effectively could not push back and was instead fighting Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) rearguard action to bleed TODCO (THE) longside advance as much as possible and lure them off their strength as much as possible

Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) what  is there Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) point to those analogies like that  why yes of course because those analogies Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) very good mental models for what is going to happen UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short squeeze campaign

remember UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) grand scheme of things TODCO (THE) goal of TODCO (THE) long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float  that means buying and holding shares  TODCO (THE) question is how much will Gartner, Inc. (IT) Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) you to move TODCO (THE) needle on that Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) to speak  TODCO (THE) higher TODCO (THE) price TODCO (THE) short side can force you to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) to lock up float TODCO (THE) longer itll take and TODCO (THE) more expensive Gartner, Inc. (IT) will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  Gartner, Inc. (IT) is also like fighting far from your supply lines UNOVA, Inc. (IN) that respect UNOVA, Inc. (IN) that there will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) weaker hands mixed UNOVA, Inc. (IN) far beyond hard support levels such that quick pushes by TODCO (THE) short side will shake them out loosening float back up

how about on TODCO (THE) long side  you want TODCO (THE) short side to overextend themselves by shorting TODCO (THE) price down on momentum and hopefully Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) them to keep building up short interest ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) lowest price ALLTEL Corporation (AT) which they will Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO)  this means having to have TODCO (THE) patience to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) price go as Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) as you can tolerate before you start losing your KeyCorp (KEY) support to despair  why  because Gartner, Inc. (IT) means youre buying TODCO (THE) shares they throw ALLTEL Corporation (AT) you ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lower price costs less to move TODCO (THE) needle on locking up liquid free float and also that their short position is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lower average price lowering TODCO (THE) price Gartner, Inc. (IT) will take to trigger Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) squeeze

TODCO (THE) above is why UNOVA, Inc. (IN) some cases you will Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sharp dip before TODCO (THE) vertical move UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) squeeze  you can essentially lure TODCO (THE) short side into AutoNation, Inc. (AN) ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points which allows you to continue to lock up free float ALLTEL Corporation (AT) ever cheaper prices while TODCO (THE) short side thinks Gartner, Inc. (IT) is winning  once you think youve accumulated enough to prevent covering without Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) parabolic price move you spike TODCO (THE) price back TODCO (THE) other way and its effectively game over  Gartner, Inc. (IT) can take some time to play out to its conclusion but that is TODCO (THE) essence of Gartner, Inc. (IT)

lets make Gartner, Inc. (IT) concrete and put some numbers to Gartner, Inc. (IT)  lets Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) you need to lock up mio more shares for TODCO (THE) squeeze no idea just using TODCO (THE) number for easy math  if you can buy Gartner, Inc. (IT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) skirmishing ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE)  line youll Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) Banta Corporation (BN) to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT)  if instead youve extended to TODCO (THE)  line youre going to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) Banta Corporation (BN)  if youre AutoNation, Inc. (AN) alphaseeking whale why Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY)  more to accomplish TODCO (THE) same thing if you can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) away with Gartner, Inc. (IT)  if you recall i referenced seeing what i thought looked like this type of ticker behavior UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my rd post

that being said you might not mess around with those types of tactics ALLTEL Corporation (AT) this point if you think youre already close to blowing up TODCO (THE) next short interest holder

if you think youre close then youre looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) most efficient way to make TODCO (THE) last tick ALLTEL Corporation (AT) trading close as high as possible

that is very similar to TODCO (THE) price action we saw on friday ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) day as mentioned earlier  if you think about Gartner, Inc. (IT) if TODCO (THE) goal is TODCO (THE) have TODCO (THE) price atabove Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain point ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) day what is more efficient  rush UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) morning then have to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) that higher price level for TODCO (THE) whole day to maintain Gartner, Inc. (IT) or wait until later UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) day as late as you think you can manage and then push to that point ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) very last tick

that ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very high level view of what youre trying to accomplish but Gartner, Inc. (IT) gets very complicated UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) details  if youre dueling with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good hft algorithm you can run into things like TODCO (THE) price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out TODCO (THE) clock kind of like fouling someone UNOVA, Inc. (IN) basketball which gets harder UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) final minutes of trading due to TODCO (THE) wider luld allowances but still doable even if you have to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) by sucking price level up maybe to give you  mins to call your buddy ALLTEL Corporation (AT) blackrock to dump shares onto TODCO (THE) ticker or something like that

another thing to keep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) mind  one of TODCO (THE) reasons these things can roll on for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long time is Gartner, Inc. (IT) might not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) one and done blowout possibly on purpose  think about itif you can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) people to keep piling short interest inparticularly for emotional reasons you can ring TODCO (THE) register as many times as they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) willing to keep doing Gartner, Inc. (IT) to ultimately prove their point  think of TODCO (THE) citron guy who reshorted back UNOVA, Inc. (IN) around what  or  i think  Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) because Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) wanted to make his point when Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) got blown out ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) move off of   there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) people piling back UNOVA, Inc. (IN) right now  who knows how many times theyre willing to reload TODCO (THE) short float

ok Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) this post is much longer than i originally intended anyway but i think TODCO (THE) diagram and some of TODCO (THE) descriptions above should provide Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good amount of food for thought and discussion  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) number of people asked me why i said that price to squeeze was secondary ALLTEL Corporation (AT) this point  if you havent already figured out why try to think about Gartner, Inc. (IT) or maybe ask UNOVA, Inc. (IN) comments and someone can help with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) further discussion

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple of final points

 assuming TODCO (THE) longside people continue to lock up liquid float remember that volatility can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) greater UNOVA, Inc. (IN) both directions  this can mean that you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) wiped out if youre somehow still trading Gamestop Corporation (GME) on margin as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) quick price collapse can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) you margin called even if TODCO (THE) price quickly rebounds later
 greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to TODCO (THE) upside  premarket and after hours trading dont have circuit breakers Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) could Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) wild during those times too
 also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently  after TODCO (THE) first frustrating day of this happening with Gamestop Corporation (GME) i made myself Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) basic thinkorswim thinkscript study Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) id have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) handy reference on whether Gartner, Inc. (IT) looked like this was going to happen  for those of you on tos use Gartner, Inc. (IT) on TODCO (THE)  minute chart  note that TODCO (THE) luld tolerances Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) different UNOVA, Inc. (IN) first few minutes and toward TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) day Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) youd have to adjust TODCO (THE) parameters or just keep Gartner, Inc. (IT) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) mind  i use Gartner, Inc. (IT) with TODCO (THE) step lines vs TODCO (THE) default line  if price crosses TODCO (THE) guard lines then youre getting closeif Gartner, Inc. (IT) crosses TODCO (THE) circuit breaker line then youre about to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) or already Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) getting halted  here is TODCO (THE) code

lets Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) started

nikola claims that they have TODCO (THE) industry first holistic leasing program including maintenance fuel and use of TODCO (THE) vehicle they plan on leasing for  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile   margin  this implies AutoNation, Inc. (AN) expense of   Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile to nikola

hydrogen costs

according to TODCO (THE) doe Gartner, Inc. (IT) currently costs King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) to produce compress and dispense hydrogen  nikola claims they can Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this for King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG)  i highly doubt their estimate and will elaborate on that later  hydrogen Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) specific energy  kwhkg  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fuel cell electric vehicle fcev Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) average thermal efficiency of   Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) diesel semi tractor which easily compares to nikolas offerings consumes about  kwh of work Perot Systems Corporation (PER) km or  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile of useful work loaded

this implies TODCO (THE) nikola truck will use  kwh of hydrogen Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) of  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile or  using their estimates  TODCO (THE) doe estimate could BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) pretty rosy as well hindenburg cited Agilent Technologies, Inc.

icct tractortrailer fuel consumption  

why Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) i doubt their hydrogen Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) estimates   Perot Systems Corporation (PER) King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(IN) TODCO (THE) us  of course there isnt Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  conversion of electricity to hydrogen AutoNation, Inc. (AN) electrolyzer uses about  kwh Perot Systems Corporation (PER) King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) of hydrogen  specific energy of kwhkg making TODCO (THE) electricity expense alone UNOVA, Inc.

(A) bogus number

i suppose they can use renewable excess during offhours for cheap but TODCO (THE) rapidly decreasing costs of energy storage will likely level out those Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) prices rather quickly  this also only works UNOVA, Inc. (IN) arizona and Agilent Technologies, Inc.

eia electricity prices nationwide  

nrel h Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) analysis from   this is just about TODCO (THE) most recent research i can find  TODCO (THE) abject lack of New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) material tells me its not exactly Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hoppin field  

fuel cell costs

part of TODCO (THE) reason there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) currently Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) few fcvs on TODCO (THE) road today is TODCO (THE) limited service life of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fuel cell  fuel cells Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) precision manufactured components that degrade quickly when jostled  vibrated too violently  this is not good when combined with TODCO (THE) rockhard suspensions of semi tractors

TODCO (THE) doe targets Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) useful life of  miles for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fuel cell  currently there is no information confirming this target Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been MetLife, Inc. (MET)  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) toyota murai comes with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  mile warranty on its fc  for TODCO (THE) sake of argument i will assume nikola Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. (FCS) can meet this target  TODCO (THE) doe targets Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) of kw for fuel cell production UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  provided mass hits   this hasnt happened yet but i will again assume this to give nikola TODCO (THE) best chance  as AutoNation, Inc. (AN) aside  nikolas decision to use exclusively General Motors Corporation (GM) fc technology UNOVA, Inc. (IN) their badger pickup indicates to me they have nothing up their sleeve to make TODCO (THE) technology more viable despite my optimistic assumptions

ill assume TODCO (THE) nikola twos fuel cell is  kw less than TODCO (THE)  kw claimed output  i think Gartner, Inc. (IT)  likely their horsepower claim will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) peak power figure only achievable when TODCO (THE) motors draw on TODCO (THE) battery  fc  i cannot confirm this because nikola does not list TODCO (THE) output of their motors and fc separately along with myriad other questionable or lack of claims  i think this is reasonable considering fc thermal efficiency is maximized between  and  load and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) semi will average  kw of useful work required on TODCO (THE) highway translating to  kw of fc usage  this is near TODCO (THE) peak efficiency band of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pemfc  this assumption also allows steadystate operation ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  of TODCO (THE) rated output  this implies AutoNation, Inc. (AN) upfront Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) of   Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) targeted useful life of  miles implies Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) depreciation expense of  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile

nrel stack durability and performance vs load chart  

battery costs

using bnef  battery Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) estimates of kwh that equates to  of battery expense  assuming Agilent Technologies, Inc.

adding their laughably Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile maintenance expense of          gives us AutoNation, Inc. (AN) aggregate  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile expense for nikola  using their fuel expense estimate of  this equates to  still more than their projected gross expenses  TODCO (THE) first estimate is  over they need for their claimed  gross margin ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile  note  i used Agilent Technologies, Inc.

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) more reasonable estimate including Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) still optimistic  interest expense for truck capex Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(AN)  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) mile expense or more than nikola can afford even when using their untenable  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) hydrogen estimate  this is before ga expenses  their leasing business model is not possible

lease projections Vivendi Universal (V) income projections  internal chaos or outright fraud

its possible some of TODCO (THE) folks ALLTEL Corporation (AT) nikola have already found those problems out though  nikola says they have plans to lease their trucks  theyve had presentation slides including TODCO (THE) idea and their truck descriptions on their website include Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(IN)  and  million UNOVA, Inc. (IN) revenue from fcev sales  this represents  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) truck and their fcev revenue scales exactly linearly into their  projected sales no room for residual from TODCO (THE)  trucks  theyre projecting to sell them  revenue from maintenance and hydrogen sales Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) also listed separately  their financial projections clearly show TODCO (THE) upfront sale of trucks with additional hydrogen fueling and maintenance revenue and TODCO (THE) leasing model slide Hasbro, Inc.

(IN) assets and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple of lease payments would allow for  this would take some intense share dilution not something i think trevor would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) on board with or extremely expensive leverage

its not like theyre going to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) cheap loans secured against their proprietary trucks requiring their proprietary stations to run only their customers preset routes  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bank wouldnt want that kind of collateral  TODCO (THE) leasing idea is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) real mess

nikla Deutsche Bank AGCO Corporation (AG) (DB) presentation projections Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) nd to last page  

one can claim that TODCO (THE) lease model is still UNOVA, Inc.

ill also point out that AutoNation, Inc. (AN) expected  fcev maintenance revenue of  million on  trucks sold assuming AutoNation, Inc. (AN) average of  miles Perot Systems Corporation (PER) truck sold UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  TODCO (THE) average mileage if TODCO (THE) trucks Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

(IN) TODCO (THE) april lease presentation  either they plan on making Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) killing from maintenance or there was some aggressive reshuffling of numbers when maintenance went from AutoNation, Inc. (AN) expense to revenue stream or vice versa

TODCO (THE) same analysis of hydrogen expenses puts their Perot Systems Corporation (PER) King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) revenue ALLTEL Corporation (AT)   still Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) but Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hefty sum above their  Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) average on TODCO (THE) leasing slide

if we use their projected fcev maintenance revenue of   Perot Systems Corporation (PER) King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

thats most of what i wanted to talk about  its pretty clear that nikola cannot possibly make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profit with their lease model and nikolas finance department Hasbro, Inc.

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc.

this really should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  level since Gartner, Inc. (IT) involves some numbers although you wont yet need Agilent Technologies, Inc.

exchange

quick note on this  unlike stocks which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) listed UNOVA, Inc. (IN) specific exchanges like National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) or New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stock options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not bound to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) particular exchange since theyre essentially just bets  its worth knowing that TODCO (THE) chicago board options exchange or cboe is TODCO (THE) biggest among them theres like  or Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) 
other ones and is home to TODCO (THE) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) popular vix more on this ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) later date  but to make things simple when picking AutoNation, Inc. (AN) exchange theres usually Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  choice which figures Gartner, Inc. (IT) out for you





TODCO (THE) market

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) its finally time to pick some options  well just like stocks TODCO (THE) first stop is to check out TODCO (THE) prices  but now were going to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) special attention to TODCO (THE) market as well because although market conditions play Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) part UNOVA, Inc. (IN) stocks they play Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crucial role with options  also if youre speculating on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) price move TODCO (THE) trick is to shop around for opportunities involving various strategies using options andor stocks because there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) many ways to bet  many more than just up or down that is  

while looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) buying options Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good rule of thumb is to make sure theres healthy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of volume  having Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) liquid market will make sure that theres enough buyers and sellers to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) and back out of TODCO (THE) position with relative ease  its entirely possible that you buy AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option and then have nobody to sell Gartner, Inc. (IT) back to ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) halfway reasonable price when TODCO (THE) time is right  

this also tends to tighten up TODCO (THE) bidask spread remember bid is sell price ask is buy price  this is another big difference with options  typically when buying stocks as long as theyre somewhat popular i dont even look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) spread  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) fact most popular stock quoters wont even show them  but youll notice that options chains rarely have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) single price and instead show you TODCO (THE) bidask separately  TODCO (THE) reason for this is that with options pennies matter  and TODCO (THE) spread will consume into your profits  

take Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) this  with march expiration  youll Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some options with  cent spread green and others with  cent spreads red  if you were to buy options from TODCO (THE) red circle youre instantly losing  dollars Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract not to mention commissions  i just checked some Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) jan  calls and some of them have like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  spread  thats  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract instantly evaporated

TODCO (THE)  factors i can think of that determine liquidity Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) option popularity some stocks dont attract options traders and strike price  expiration date  even popular stocks lose volume if you look to far ahead or if you pick strike prices that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) far from TODCO (THE) money  

make that   open interest or Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) or original poster int  this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) metric that youll typically Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options chains indicating TODCO (THE) number of live contracts which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) out on TODCO (THE) market high Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) would imply that theres high volume TODCO (THE) reason why volume and Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not necessarily TODCO (THE) same is because UNOVA, Inc. (IN) practice you can write Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) contract create Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) one and adding  to TODCO (THE) Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) tally and later buy Gartner, Inc. (IT) back subtracting  to Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) tally  if this scenario played out UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) empty market TODCO (THE) volume would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  and Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) 






timing

timing is everything with options  remember that TODCO (THE) moment you buy AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option Gartner, Inc. (IT) starts losing extrinsic value from time decay Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) this is important  as noted by  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) last post time decay is not linear  meaning that stocks wont lose Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) set amount every day until expiration  


 showing what TODCO (THE) time decay looks like as dictated by TODCO (THE)  model  youll notice TODCO (THE) drop UNOVA, Inc. (IN) price due to time decay exponentially increases ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  days from expiration  this doesnt mean options with less than  days Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) no good but if you buy them Gartner, Inc. (IT) should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) part of your strategy like Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) day trade


another important thing to consider is recent news with TODCO (THE) underlying stock  big events can temporarily dislodge prices which you can also use UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your favor if you want  announced dividends is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big one  for various reasons on AutoNation, Inc. (AN) exdividend date call prices will go down and put prices will go up  another big one is earnings releases  youll notice Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) huge buildup UNOVA, Inc. (IN) premiums due to implied volatility as AutoNation, Inc. (AN) earnings release approaches and then Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) huge drop TODCO (THE) day after  this affects calls and puts alike  





edit strike price

credit to  for bringing this up


additional observation from  who points out that this point becomes gray area when TODCO (THE) strike and underlying price Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) close

another important thing to remember is TODCO (THE) dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value because after Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) when TODCO (THE) expiration day comes thats Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) theyre worth  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) buying AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option with no intrinsic value not itm Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) TODCO (THE) potential to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worthless upon expiration  

that said theyre not always bad depending on your strategy  for example buying AutoNation, Inc. (AN) otm option is sort of like buying Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) house with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  interest mortgage your monthly mortgage payments only go towards TODCO (THE) interest but not towards TODCO (THE) principal of TODCO (THE) house  some people actually Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this because they believe TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) house will go up and theyll resell Gartner, Inc. (IT) for profit





leverage

this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very important concept which early options traders dont realize right away and is TODCO (THE) reason options can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) powerful andor dangerous

options harness TODCO (THE) power of leverage by relying on changes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) price to derive their values and not necessarily TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) underlying  for example lets compare McDonald's Corporation (MCD) and grpn currently trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  and  respectively  if you look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) their march expirations options youll Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that TODCO (THE) price for AutoNation, Inc. (AN) atthemoney call strike prices  and  is about  for each of them  and yes i realize McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is not quite  yet but if you factor out intrinsic and extrinsic values youll end up about TODCO (THE) same

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) for  you can buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call which expires next month for either of these two companies and youve exposed yourself to  shares of said Molson Coors Brewing (Company) 

now ceteris paribus if TODCO (THE) price of both grpn and McDonald's Corporation (MCD) went up tomorrow by  TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) McDonald's Corporation (MCD) call would go up to around  while TODCO (THE) price of grpns call would go up to around   thats TODCO (THE) difference between profiting  vs   

and TODCO (THE) reason for this is because if McDonald's Corporation (MCD) went up by  Gartner, Inc. (IT) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) up  and if grpn went up by  Gartner, Inc. (IT) would only BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) up by  and TODCO (THE) premium only cares about relative price movement and not necessarily about TODCO (THE) underlyings value this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) simplification

this is also why expensive stocks like Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) popular with options gamblers because as youve already seen here they can have huge swings  and this is also how Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of people go broke


i realize i sped through this topic  if Gartner, Inc. (IT) left you confused ask and ill either reply or modify TODCO (THE) post






TODCO (THE) chain


and finally TODCO (THE) chain  this is just to Titanium Metals Corporation (TIE) up some of these concepts and you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) what they look like UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) real world  ALLTEL Corporation (AT) first Gartner, Inc. (IT) can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) overwhelming when looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) options chains but if you know what youre looking for theyre not that bad  Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) going to show you what Gartner, Inc. (IT) looks like UNOVA, Inc. (IN) optionshouse but most chains will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) similar UNOVA, Inc. (IN) nature and information

since stock market is down now i thought about selling my loss and buying indexmutual funds like sp with Agilent Technologies, Inc.

this will not last

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) what i wanted to analyze is should we really BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worried about TODCO (THE) current trends or is this TODCO (THE) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) normal given TODCO (THE) drastically different situation we find ourselves UNOVA, Inc. (IN) finally this would give us AutoNation, Inc. (AN) insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments 

TODCO (THE) warning signs

lets first look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) dive into TODCO (THE) various concerning trends that we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) observing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) current market spoiler alert  there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of them

pe shiller pe cape

TODCO (THE) price to earnings ratio Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been historically used to understand if TODCO (THE) marketcompany is overvalued when compared to historical trends shiller pe is adjusted for TODCO (THE) cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal pe

TODCO (THE) current concern is that as of National-Oilwell, Inc. (NOV) TODCO (THE) shiller pe for TODCO (THE) sp  crossed  which is TODCO (THE) highest reading UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) last two decades TODCO (THE) last time TODCO (THE) shiller pe crossed  was during TODCO (THE)  dot com bubble TODCO (THE) value reached only Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) max of  before TODCO (THE)  financial crisis

TODCO (THE) red flag here is that those who invested when TODCO (THE) cape was above  last time  had to wait another  years to break even for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) brief period of time just before TODCO (THE)  housing market crash and then wait another  more years before TODCO (THE) market consistently settled above their buyin price

money supply growth aka money printer go brrr

 while Gartner, Inc. (IT) might BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) argued that there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) structural reasons why this was required there is no denying that only Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small portion went into TODCO (THE) actual paychecks that people received and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat one can argue that even TODCO (THE) stimulus Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been increasingly trapped within TODCO (THE) financial markets and fueled speculation

increasing use of leverage

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) two ways of using leverage while investing TODCO (THE) first method is borrowing money to invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) markets and TODCO (THE) other is using options both of these have seen Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) dramatic rise UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) past  years

 for almost  investors shows staggering results  of gen z and  of millennial investors have borrowed money to invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market more than  of TODCO (THE) surveyed population borrowed more than Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) or more for investing while leverage works great UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bull market Gartner, Inc. (IT) can destroy your portfolio during downturns 

 shows AutoNation, Inc. (AN) even more concerning trend retail brokers alone Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) now trading more options than TODCO (THE) entire market used to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  while this can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) attributed to TODCO (THE) democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as robinhood fidelity etrade etc its highly unlikely that Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) retail traders who Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) using options completely understand TODCO (THE) instrument and TODCO (THE) inherent risks while using Gartner, Inc. (IT)

rise of New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) issues and speculative assets

more than  billion have been raised by ipos this year this is TODCO (THE) highest number of deals UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) last decade or Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) and Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) even left TODCO (THE)  record UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) dust TODCO (THE) cherry on top was  where TODCO (THE) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) is now valued ALLTEL Corporation (AT) more than  billion with zero revenue and less than  million UNOVA, Inc. (IN) preorder deposits

spacs 

this is without even getting into TODCO (THE) speculative world of crypto where  for more than half Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) billion dollars Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) coin that started as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) literal joke Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) market cap of  billion and there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) now more ICOS Corporation (ICOS) than anyone can keep track of

investor expectations

more than TODCO (THE) pe ratio i TODCO (THE) pricetosales ratio shows how much TODCO (THE) market values every dollar of TODCO (THE) companys sales as we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) on TODCO (THE) chart below more than double TODCO (THE) companies Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trading above USX Corporation (X) their sales when compared to TODCO (THE)  dot com bubble

if you consider Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  stocks that had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very high ps ratio have underperformed those having Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) ps ratio since most companies dont grow as Perot Systems Corporation (PER) expectations

now thats Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of bad news for anyone to digest but

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) we certain its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) multiple factors that can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) attributed to TODCO (THE) current rally just because we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) impressive rally Gartner, Inc. (IT) does not mean TODCO (THE) only eventual outcome is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble and subsequent crash lets look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) KeyCorp (KEY) factors that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) driving up TODCO (THE) stock prices over TODCO (THE) last few years

lowinterest rates

this is one of TODCO (THE) KeyCorp (KEY) aspects that many miss while comparing TODCO (THE) current rally to TODCO (THE) s dotcom bubble between  and  TODCO (THE) fed rate varied from    compared to TODCO (THE)  this means that TODCO (THE) capital available now is much cheaper to prop up TODCO (THE) economy after covid than Gartner, Inc. (IT) ever was this is bound to have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive impact on TODCO (THE) stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to TODCO (THE) stock market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) search of better returns

New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) investors

its no secret that we Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) hate robinhood  shows that there Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) staggering growth UNOVA, Inc. (IN) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) investorstraders coming to TODCO (THE) market Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of these New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) investors would bring fresh capital into TODCO (THE) market triggering another bull run which we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) experiencing now

Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) and index funds

as i have highlighted UNOVA, Inc. (IN) s TODCO (THE) amount of inflow us index funds receive is massive more than  billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just TODCO (THE) vanguard  index fund this year and index funds Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) expected to make up  according to  from fidelity TODCO (THE) average Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) account now Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) balance of Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) and  of workers increased their contribution

TODCO (THE) KeyCorp (KEY) point being Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) this New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) capital that is being allocated into TODCO (THE) index funds is expected to cause Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) rise UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) overall valuation of TODCO (THE) stock market 

whats TODCO (THE) implication

as long as TODCO (THE) above factors remain as is fed maintaining its rate and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) steady supply of fresh capital we might Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) party go on much longer than expected

conclusion

TODCO (THE) market of  is significantly different when compared to TODCO (THE) s as we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) more investors cheaper capital and even more passive funds that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) flowing into TODCO (THE) market than ever before Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i feel that looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) current market and comparing Gartner, Inc. (IT) directly to TODCO (THE) dotcom bubble is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) tad wrong

but thats not to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) that Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) is well almost Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) fundamental indicators Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) flashing red and even TODCO (THE) experts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) predicting Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) significant drawdown UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) near future

TODCO (THE) expected annual return by investors which is  more than what is realistic  this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) testament to TODCO (THE) euphoria we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) seeing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market now where Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) yearly doubledigit return is TODCO (THE) norm

even if we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) dotcom bubblelike scenario  perfectly summarizes TODCO (THE) issues with making money calling Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) middle of TODCO (THE) bubble

basically even though everyone knew Gartner, Inc. (IT) was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble back UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  investment firms did entire conferences comparing TODCO (THE) internet companies to tulip mania as early as  making money using that information was hard there were Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few investors such as mark cuban and john templeton who successfully shorted TODCO (THE) stocks ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) peak of TODCO (THE) bubble and made Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) killing when TODCO (THE) market crashed but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting AutoNation, Inc. (AN) overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected

Gartner, Inc. (IT) makes perfect sense to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) apprehensive about investing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) current market but pundits have been calling Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  right now based on fundamentals TODCO (THE) chances Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) look far higher Gartner, Inc. (IT) does make sense to not make significant onetime investments UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market now but changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) best longterm strategy

stock market,investing,Russian Stock Market to Partially Reopen on Thursday,"russias stock market is set to have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) partial reopening thursday nearly Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) month after Gartner, Inc. (IT) shut down following TODCO (THE) invasion of ukraine 
TODCO (THE) challenge for moscow is that TODCO (THE) resumption of trading could simply send russian stocks back into free fall on feb  TODCO (THE) day when president vladimir putin began TODCO (THE) assault on ukraine TODCO (THE) main russian stock index tumbled  while TODCO (THE) index regained Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fraction of those losses on feb its last day of tradingthat was before western sanctions hammered TODCO (THE) ruble and sent TODCO (THE) country into AutoNation, Inc. (AN) economic crisis

to limit TODCO (THE) fallout moscow Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) turned to some heavyhanded policies Gartner, Inc. (IT) blocked foreign investors from dumping local stocksa move that some market participants saw as retaliation for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) western freeze on russian central bank assets since Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big chunk of TODCO (THE) russian market is owned by foreigners TODCO (THE) russian government ordered its main sovereignwealth fund to buy billions of dollars worth of shares 

TODCO (THE) russian stock market could ultimately look very different than Gartner, Inc. (IT) did before with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) plan under discussion to split Gartner, Inc. (IT) into separate markets for foreign and local investors according to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) person familiar with TODCO (THE) matter

russias central bank said wednesday that Gartner, Inc. (IT) will allow trading of  shares out of  included UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) benchmark stock index TODCO (THE) Moscow Exchange (MOEX) on thursday from  American Greetings Corporation (AM) to  pm moscow time among TODCO (THE) companies to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) traded Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) gazprom pjsc and lukoil pjsc bets on TODCO (THE) fall of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock known as shortselling will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) banned

under Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) policy announced by TODCO (THE) central bank on feb  russian brokerages arent allowed to let foreign clients sell securities this will prevent foreigners from bolting for TODCO (THE) exits as soon as TODCO (THE) market reopens which could BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) ruinous because of their outsize role UNOVA, Inc. (IN) russian stocks international institutional investors held about threequarters of TODCO (THE) russian markets free float as of february  according to sberbank investment research

that Hasbro, Inc.

among TODCO (THE) western investors that held russian stocks before TODCO (THE) freeze were assetmanagement giants vanguard group and fidelity international both firms have said they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) reducing exposure to russia
due to TODCO (THE) freeze foreign investors wont have much to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) when TODCO (THE) stock market reopens 

but TODCO (THE) plan under consideration by russian officialswhich is still UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) discussion stageswould effectively split TODCO (THE) countrys securities market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) two with one market for foreigners and another for local investors TODCO (THE) person familiar with TODCO (THE) matter said UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this arrangement foreign investors could sell their shares or bonds but would face restrictions on moving TODCO (THE) proceeds out of russia because of capital controls that moscow Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) imposed since february TODCO (THE) person said

such Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bifurcated market could result UNOVA, Inc. (IN) oddities such as TODCO (THE) same stock having two different prices that isnt completely unprecedented UNOVA, Inc. (IN) china there have long been discrepancies between shares on mainland exchanges UNOVA, Inc. (IN) shanghai and shenzhen and those listed UNOVA, Inc. (IN) hong kong
Gartner, Inc. (IT) could also prevent further erosion of TODCO (THE) rubles value russias currency Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) stabilized UNOVA, Inc. (IN) recent sessions to trade near  rubles to TODCO (THE) dollar though Gartner, Inc. (IT) remains  weaker than before russia invaded ukraine

TODCO (THE) biggest fear is that TODCO (THE) central bank is under sanctions and they dont want foreign investors to sell their shares and take TODCO (THE) ruble and buy hard currency said jacob grapengiesser head of eastern europe ALLTEL Corporation (AT) emerging markets fund manager east capital

TODCO (THE) moscow exchange said monday that Gartner, Inc. (IT) would allow for TODCO (THE) settlement of trades that foreign investors had placed before feb  that were still being processed mr grapengiesser said his firm had trades still awaiting settlement from TODCO (THE) start of TODCO (THE) war that Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.

its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) natural step before opening TODCO (THE) market you need to take care of those unsettled trades Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) said things Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) slowly moving forward
shortly after TODCO (THE) war began russias prime minister ordered TODCO (THE) countrys national wealth fund to buy up to one trillion rubles equivalent to  billion worth of shares this year analysts also expect some russian oil companies to prop up their share prices with buyback programs

local investors may buy stocks too when russia invaded crimea TODCO (THE) Moscow Exchange (MOEX) fell almost  between midfebruary and midmarch of  but by TODCO (THE) end of that year Gartner, Inc. (IT) had rebounded more than  from that march Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) TODCO (THE) broad index Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) posted gains UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) but one year since  stocks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) unstable countries can also serve as hedges against inflation because locals expect companies can offset rising costs by charging higher prices

TODCO (THE) governments efforts have led some to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) cautiously optimistic about TODCO (THE) reopening initially i think there will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) moderate correction said natalia smirnova Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) financial adviser UNOVA, Inc.

(MET) id purchase TODCO (THE) security hold Gartner, Inc. (IT) and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals
once TODCO (THE) security was bought and sold id write down TODCO (THE) trade and move onto TODCO (THE) next day TODCO (THE) end result was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) predefined date range with TODCO (THE) predefined list of tickers

they state as TODCO (THE) reason that they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) better able to manage  investments than  and since they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not trying to beat TODCO (THE) returns of TODCO (THE) index  their words  theyd rather find stocks with lower beta volatility and thus likely lower returns

they locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within TODCO (THE) sp  once Perot Systems Corporation (PER) quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments they target Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  annual return after accounting for their  fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain amount of money invested with them  this amounts to  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) year for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) m portfolio for many years  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of money to part with

did i mention you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them unless you happen to already own one of TODCO (THE)  stocks they pick Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) tax consequences of getting involved

for TODCO (THE) hnw folks TODCO (THE) above offering is available and they offer additional products such as TODCO (THE) ability to invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) private equity reits and hedge funds as you might imagine TODCO (THE) more money they manage TODCO (THE) more free accounting services they include

personal capital

this may actually BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) my favorite given TODCO (THE) simplicity of Gartner, Inc. (IT) they take TODCO (THE) main sector etfs and eliminate any stocks that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) losing money to recreate their own etfs by sector they charge you Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fee to use their etfs

they start with AutoNation, Inc.

(DO) this annually they Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) nothing Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) year

they charge Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fee for managing your money i recall Gartner, Inc. (IT) being  or  basis points but you have to also Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) to use their etfs Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) creeps towards TODCO (THE) better part of Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(A) group of TODCO (THE) sector etfs calling Gartner, Inc. (IT) quits

ritholtz wealth management

if youve watched cnbc regularly youd recognize TODCO (THE) commentator josh brown  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) partner of ritholtz wealth management hes TODCO (THE) one with TODCO (THE) thick New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) york city accent when i found out i may have TODCO (THE) chance to have his insights managing my money i was excited as Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) always seemed Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) knowledgeable but TODCO (THE) wealth management shop was not impressive

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) fact their model was exactly TODCO (THE) same as that of goldman sachs they pick about  stocks stick your money UNOVA, Inc. (IN) them rotate them every quarter and keep volatility Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) on TODCO (THE) stocks they pick they target  annually net of fees yes you heard that correctly 

TODCO (THE) next group of wealth management shops Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) fell into one of three other categories SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) collars etf aggregators or tactical investors

SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) collars

this strategy involved putting Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of your money into TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) etf then selling call options on that investment out of TODCO (THE) money Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few months out ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) time they take TODCO (THE) income from TODCO (THE) sale of these options and purchase out of TODCO (THE) money puts on TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) for similar expiration dates this strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside for those who Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not used to options heres how Gartner, Inc. (IT) works

lets Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) is trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  you own Gartner, Inc. (IT) you sell someone else TODCO (THE) right to buy Gartner, Inc. (IT) from you for  for  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) call Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) long as TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) stays under  TODCO (THE) other person will not execute TODCO (THE) call and you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) to keep TODCO (THE) money for TODCO (THE) call premium if TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) goes above  you have to either sell your shares ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  plus pocket TODCO (THE)  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) call option premium making this Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sale ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  or buy TODCO (THE) call back ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) higher price than what you sold Gartner, Inc. (IT) for youd lose money on TODCO (THE) call but TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) shares have gained UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) you still come out ahead you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) just not as ahead as you would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) had you simply bought and held TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) way to  this creates Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ceiling UNOVA, Inc. (IN) terms of TODCO (THE) max amount you can obtain on TODCO (THE) upside of your investment

TODCO (THE) option puts work TODCO (THE) other way protecting your investment on TODCO (THE) way down since you used TODCO (THE) premium collected on TODCO (THE) sale of TODCO (THE) call to buy TODCO (THE) puts you havent spent any New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) money but have bought yourself insurance if TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) drops TODCO (THE) value of your put option Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short on your own investment increases this increase offsets your losses protecting you especially UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) case of extreme correction

if TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) rises you lose TODCO (THE) value of your put Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) you have to account for that UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your net income for TODCO (THE) investment

if you dont follow this dont worry TODCO (THE) net effect is they use options to prevent Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) major loss but UNOVA, Inc. (IN) doing Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) they also prevent you from having any major gains you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trapped or collared within AutoNation, Inc. (AN) acceptable range of returns over time you will not beat TODCO (THE) sp  index with this strategy and they Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) this

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) there is only value to this strategy if you simply Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) unwilling to trade Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) really bad year once UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) while for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) great year once UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) while its mostly about your investment time horizon and whether you need regular access to TODCO (THE) money

etf and mutual fund aggregators

about  firms i interviewed used this strategy i heard TODCO (THE) same thing Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) often i thought maybe they were dumbing Gartner, Inc. (IT) down for me essentially they just bought Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) sector etfs or Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) basket of mutual funds for you Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few of TODCO (THE) firms would use TODCO (THE) collars i spoke of above if TODCO (THE) market got Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) little choppy but most did not

this strategy was most common with smaller wealth management shops  under m aum  which tried to differentiate themselves as financial planners that happen to look after your money TODCO (THE) bulk of them did very very little to watch TODCO (THE) market and most flat out stated they only looked ALLTEL Corporation (AT) these quarterly

i could not understand what they did Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) day until one referred to himself as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) market psychologist because his job was to calm clients down when TODCO (THE) market shits itself i have vodka for that Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) this strategy was not for me

tactical firms

these firms were harder to find and their Genentech, Inc. (DNA) was more similar to day traders UNOVA, Inc. (IN) terms of their mentality they invested UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) basket of stocks they thought represented Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) blend of value growth and good dividends they chose them annually but were much more likely to liquidate and go to cash if they thought Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) correction was coming Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) they had cash to buy TODCO (THE) dip

one thing i did learn from them though was tax loss harvesting  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) term for specifically taking losses on investments to offset gains on others

TODCO (THE) best way they did this was by rolling calls on equities that had risen UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value imagine holding apple stock and selling Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call on Gartner, Inc. (IT) if apple goes up you must then choose to sell TODCO (THE) stock or buy TODCO (THE) call back ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) higher price for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) loss if you Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) TODCO (THE) latter UNOVA, Inc. (IN) year  and sell Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) second option UNOVA, Inc. (IN) year  ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) same price or more than TODCO (THE) call you bought back you can write off TODCO (THE) loss UNOVA, Inc. (IN) year  while avoiding actual losses

you can roll calls like this forever amassing paper losses while you actually gain UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) underlying equity Gartner, Inc. (IT) was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) nice trick iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) used many times now especially when i want to sell something iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) held for years with significant gains

their desire to protect TODCO (THE) portfolio i felt prevented them from participating UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) quick rebounds UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  when i spoke to them they felt Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crash was imminent and had gone to  cash UNOVA, Inc. (IN) their portfolio i never reached back out to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) how they did but i suspect they were buying TODCO (THE) dips UNOVA, Inc. (IN) march 

their overall returns were around  but not as good as simply buying TODCO (THE) SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) and holding but they did seem to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to minimize TODCO (THE) downside of some on major events

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) end i never hired any of them i decided instead to use what i learned and what i knew and manage my own money UNOVA, Inc. (IN) case you read this far and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) curious yes my returns have beaten Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) these firms average returns and iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) actually learned Agilent Technologies, Inc.

but what is interesting is that i could not find any research that Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been done on TODCO (THE) best way to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) dollarcost averaging

theoretically there must BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) better way than to randomly throw your hardearned money once Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) month into SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) right

analysis

given that dollarcost averaging is about holding investments longterm we need data lots and lots of data for this i have pulled TODCO (THE) adjusted daily closing price  shiller pe ratio of SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) for TODCO (THE) last  years 

now we have to devise different methods to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

average St. Joe Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (JOE) invests on TODCO (THE) first of every month no matter how TODCO (THE) market is trending this would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) our benchmark

cautious charlie invests UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market only if TODCO (THE) price to earnings ratio  is lesser than TODCO (THE) last year rolling average else will hold treasurybills 

balanced barry invests UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market only if TODCO (THE) price to earnings ratio is within   of TODCO (THE) last year rolling average else will hold tbills

analyst alan invests whenever TODCO (THE) market pulls back Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain percentage from TODCO (THE) last alltime high else will hold tbills 

given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment i have considered TODCO (THE) starting point to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) st jan  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) analysis is based on someone who invested  every month since  UNOVA, Inc.

limitations

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some limitations to TODCO (THE) analysis

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) tax on TODCO (THE) gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not considered UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) analysis both of these would adversely affect TODCO (THE) overall returns

   over TODCO (THE) next two weeks Gartner, Inc. (IT) had massive swings but Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) high of  dollars Agilent Technologies, Inc.

   Gartner, Inc. (IT) ended up falling to about  or  dollars Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) share over TODCO (THE) next year and yes i watched Gartner, Inc.

options,stocks,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ton of experience trading options which is why Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of my posts and education Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) past and definitely know enough of TODCO (THE) basics to share for Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) traders that ask me about options on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) daily basis if you already have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of experience with options this post may not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very beneficial to you because Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) just going to cover TODCO (THE) basics of options how they work and give Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) quick rundown on ways that you can trade them

first and foremost what Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) options options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) actually options when you buy AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option contract you then have TODCO (THE) option to buy or sell TODCO (THE) underlying stock ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) predetermined price up to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) prespecified date if you decide to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) then exercising your options

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) two types of options that you can trade which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) call options and put options call options or just calls allow TODCO (THE) holder to buy ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) predetermined price and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) options equivalent to simply buying or longing TODCO (THE) underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow TODCO (THE) holder to sell ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) predetermined price and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) options equivalent to shortselling TODCO (THE) underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as TODCO (THE) underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of TODCO (THE) underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised

 

now TODCO (THE) predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares ALLTEL Corporation (AT) by exercising your option contracts is known as TODCO (THE) strike price when buying options you have to choose Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price along with AutoNation, Inc. (AN) expiration date which is TODCO (THE) last day that your options can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) exercised both TODCO (THE) strike price and expiration date play Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big role UNOVA, Inc. (IN) choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how TODCO (THE) options will trade before getting into why these have such Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big affect on TODCO (THE) options its important to know Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit more general options information

as for strike prices there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) really two main kinds UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money itm and out of TODCO (THE) money otm itm and otm refer to TODCO (THE) underlying stocks price UNOVA, Inc. (IN) relation to TODCO (THE) strike price of TODCO (THE) contract calls with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price below TODCO (THE) current price of TODCO (THE) underlying stock Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) considered itm whereas calls with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price above TODCO (THE) current price would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) considered otm on TODCO (THE) other side of TODCO (THE) spectrum since you want TODCO (THE) stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) itm if TODCO (THE) strike price is above TODCO (THE) current stock price and otm if TODCO (THE) strike price is below TODCO (THE) current stock price

 

i know its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit confusing if youre New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) to options to give AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example if stock xyz was trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call option with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price of  would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) itm since TODCO (THE) underlying stock is already above TODCO (THE) strike price however since calls and puts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) essentially opposite Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price of  would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) otm put UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this scenario

whether AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is itm or otm Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big impact on how to option will trade TODCO (THE) main reason for this is because Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) otm options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) worthless ALLTEL Corporation (AT) expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option ALLTEL Corporation (AT)   USX Corporation (X)  your contract would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worth  if Gartner, Inc. (IT) was otm ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) markets close on TODCO (THE) expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worthless ALLTEL Corporation (AT) expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) affected by time decay

time decay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options causes TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) contracts also known as TODCO (THE) premium to decrease as Gartner, Inc. (IT) gets closer to expiration this alone makes being Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profitable options trader much more difficult UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion because even if TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) underlying stocks remains TODCO (THE) same for days ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) time both calls and puts will decrease UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value because of TODCO (THE) time decay Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to profit from options you have to not only BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) right about TODCO (THE) stocks direction but you have to time Gartner, Inc. (IT) near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay

time decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) represented by what Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) known as greeks TODCO (THE) greeks Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) theta vega delta and gamma like i said TODCO (THE) meaning of this post is really just to cover TODCO (THE) basics Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) not going to go into Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ton of detail on TODCO (THE) greeks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this post but i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least want to explain theta theta is TODCO (THE) greek representing time decay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) options theta along with TODCO (THE) other greeks before you even trade Gartner, Inc. (IT) and Gartner, Inc. (IT) can tell you how much TODCO (THE) contract is expected to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) affected by time decay generally TODCO (THE) theta will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  similarly theta will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) higher for options that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few weeks away from expiration compared to options Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few months away from expiration because they lose more value as TODCO (THE) expiration date approaches

theta makes general trading rules like dont fight TODCO (THE) trend even more important for example if you bought calls UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) downtrending stock because you thought that Gartner, Inc. (IT) was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate ALLTEL Corporation (AT) support Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this situation youd BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) correct about TODCO (THE) stock finding TODCO (THE) bottom but you would still lose money if Gartner, Inc. (IT) didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought TODCO (THE) underlying stock rather than call options youd BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) breakeven as TODCO (THE) stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating ALLTEL Corporation (AT) support

 

although time decay can have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) major negative impact on your options trades there is actually Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) way to have Gartner, Inc. (IT) work UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from TODCO (THE) price going down Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) time decay create profits for options that you sold short UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion this should really only BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling

TODCO (THE) reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as TODCO (THE) options increase UNOVA, Inc. (IN) price its TODCO (THE) same reason that many people Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) afraid to shortsell stocks but options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend Gartner, Inc. (IT) for beginners i wanted to ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least explain TODCO (THE) concept of writing options UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this post

regardless of how you trade options its important to ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least understand Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) priced like any other type of trading you should only BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) using money that you can afford to lose UNOVA, Inc. (IN) its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading TODCO (THE) extremely volatile contracts that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) near their expiration which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) ones that attract Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many traders because of their ability to make big runs UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short period of time

maybe after this youll Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) traders think and can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very dangerous for inexperienced traders that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) enticed by TODCO (THE) big potential returns

hope this was helpful let me know what ya think",1862,Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) one of TODCO (THE) main reasons to trade options is to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) given TODCO (THE) opportunity to trade with leverage,"great post by TODCO (THE) original poster one aspect Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) did not touch on is TODCO (THE) fact that Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) pieces that go into TODCO (THE) value of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option act like exponential curves why is this important to understand

lets start with theta or time value theta decay is not linear if we compare AutoNation, Inc. (AN) april and july option of TODCO (THE) same strike TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) option will drop more tomorrow UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) april option than Gartner, Inc. (IT) will UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) july option UNOVA, Inc. (IN) fact there is virtually no theta decay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) july option right now theta decay really becomes important to consider  days before expiration

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my trading i prefer to trade UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options  days out Gartner, Inc. (IT) will Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) me more to own that theta but Gartner, Inc. (IT) also gives me TODCO (THE) chance to change my mind UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) first few weeks without losing theta value this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) more conservative approach i use options to generate small incremental returns or to add some profit opportunity to core positions when i think Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) news item might move TODCO (THE) stock sharply

TODCO (THE) next variable to consider is called delta  this variable measures TODCO (THE) rate of change expected UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) option relative to TODCO (THE) underlying stock price if i buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  strike call on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  TODCO (THE) option should rise  for each  rise UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) stock  this is called delta  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) industry TODCO (THE) one is shorthand for  or   TODCO (THE) option price change will reflect  of TODCO (THE) stock price change delta  means  optimally you want AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option that goes from delta  or  to delta  with  days left before expiration you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) TODCO (THE) benefit of TODCO (THE) share price move and preserve some theta value you can recapture UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) sale  unfortunately there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) no freely available tools that will tell you TODCO (THE) delta of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) particular option without them you have to just feel Gartner, Inc. (IT) out but Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good rule of thumb is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  differential is roughly delta  and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  differential is probably delta  ie TODCO (THE) option is not going to budge much even if TODCO (THE) stock moves 

you will Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) TODCO (THE) most out of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option if you can play those periods where TODCO (THE) delta is increasing rapidly take that  stock again lets buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call option with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  strike price if TODCO (THE) stock goes to  TODCO (THE) option will not move much as TODCO (THE) stock rises more TODCO (THE) option will react more this is how you can make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very high rate of return on options that  strike premium will make TODCO (THE) option quite cheap maybe Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  depending on TODCO (THE) other variable if TODCO (THE) stock gets to  that option is probably close to  triple your money

TODCO (THE) last important variable is vol short for volatility Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock that Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) large frequent swings is more likely to Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) any given strike price than Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) slowmoving stock traders price TODCO (THE) options differently as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) result UNOVA, Inc. (IN) bull markets general stock market vol declines which generally means that individual stock vol declines as well on average but if markets start behaving dramatically stock option values increase as this vol becomes more valuable this is why having some puts UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your portfolio after strong bull markets might make sense puts increase UNOVA, Inc. (IN) prices as stocks fall and as vol increases its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) double payday

TODCO (THE) value of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is largely TODCO (THE) sum of these three variables theta is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) you have to just accept TODCO (THE) higher TODCO (THE) delta UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option TODCO (THE) less risk you have of losing everything ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) of muchreduced upside since changes UNOVA, Inc.

these Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation  someone trying to increase net worth not increase income  and they may not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) suitable for everyone

understand TODCO (THE) trading environment

one mistake i made more than Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few times was not understanding or paying attention to TODCO (THE) trading environment i was UNOVA, Inc. (IN) before picking out Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strategy what Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) i mean i need to know where things Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) year UNOVA, Inc. (IN) relation to earnings season and UNOVA, Inc. (IN) relation to sector rotations i need to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) attention to TODCO (THE) macroeconomic indicators and i need to watch TODCO (THE) vix

mind TODCO (THE) Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc. (The) (GAP) between earnings seasons i cant stress this enough when earnings Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) strong and earnings data is coming UNOVA, Inc. (IN) investors watch those like hawks good earnings reports bring confidence to TODCO (THE) market which yields Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) rising market 

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) between earnings seasons there is less data from companies to review and investors Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation year bond yields and what TODCO (THE) fed is doing this makes for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) much jumpier market thats more likely to pull back  its also Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) time when TODCO (THE) large asset managers rebalance their portfolios they manage billions Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) overweight UNOVA, Inc. (IN) one asset class eg value stocks energy and underweight UNOVA, Inc. (IN) other asset classes eg growth stocks technology

i try not to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) caught by these patterns i anticipate they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) coming and invest accordingly simply put i buy TODCO (THE) pullback after TODCO (THE) rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) general rule of course i dont Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this if i expect Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) terrible earnings season 

take advantage of sector rotations

TODCO (THE) sector rotations Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) pretty predictable if you track TODCO (THE) performance of TODCO (THE) different sectors over TODCO (THE) year i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this by plotting sector etfs on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot begin to flatten or pull back professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (HOT) TODCO (THE) last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) better value or opportunity for upside if i run TODCO (THE) pe ratios for TODCO (THE) sector etfs i can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) quick sense of TODCO (THE) sectors that have had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (HOT) run up over  pe vs other sectors that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) more modestly valued just keep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) mind that certain sectors like Techne Corporation (TECH) will always BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) valued more richly given their growth Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) pe ratios is not apples to apples  its just Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) way to note if historically that sector is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) high end of its own typical valuation range

last years worst performing sector tends to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) one of TODCO (THE) best performing sectors TODCO (THE) following year this is because investors prefer to buy Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) and sell high i dont bet against this trend its been around longer than i have and will continue to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) around long after Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) dirt 

last year you couldnt give away Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) barrel of oil last week oil reached  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) barrel 

one of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) money for sector etfs that underperformed TODCO (THE) previous year i buy calls with expirations UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  months knowing that i will sell ALLTEL Corporation (AT) my exit point which for me is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  gain sometimes this happens  weeks into TODCO (THE) year other times Gartner, Inc. (IT) takes  months Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) long as i dont overpay for TODCO (THE) options Gartner, Inc. (IT) works i dont like to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) more than TODCO (THE) average price return of TODCO (THE) sector for example if TODCO (THE) sector etf averages Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  annual return and TODCO (THE) etf price is  Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) not going to buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call for more than  that way if TODCO (THE) sector only moves  i can still make money provided TODCO (THE) price increase moves quickly enough

make TODCO (THE) vix your friend

TODCO (THE) vix is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) easy way to gauge fear UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) marketplace and is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hedge used widely against market pullbacks if TODCO (THE) vix goes up TODCO (THE) market is worried if Gartner, Inc. (IT) goes down TODCO (THE) market is getting bullish if Gartner, Inc. (IT) stays up everyone is on edge its hard to make good trades UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) environment where everyone is on edge and ready to Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) TODCO (THE) sell button Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) careful buying during times when TODCO (THE) vix is high on TODCO (THE) flip side if TODCO (THE) market Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) pulled back and TODCO (THE) vix starts to retreat away from its highs that makes for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good entry point 

another interesting phenomenon is when TODCO (THE) vix is higher than normal there tends to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) selloff TODCO (THE) friday before Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long weekend this happens because investors dont want to sit through Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their tuesday with losses piling up iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) nice time to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) some discounts ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) day friday or to run some weekly puts on thursday afternoon before TODCO (THE) dips 

selecting trades  investments

have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) allocation plan

TODCO (THE) first thing i recommend is determining UNOVA, Inc. (IN) advance TODCO (THE) amount of money you want to invest longer term vs TODCO (THE) amount you want to invest short term vs TODCO (THE) amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies anything shorter term is higher risk higher reward i break my portfolio UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) following buckets

  longterm market investment using equity etfs that largely track TODCO (THE) spx or Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) breakdown between bonds and TODCO (THE) market i use vanguard funds and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small cap value fund called calf i will not touch this money for  years
  cash i like to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) ready to buy TODCO (THE) dips and have enough to spare this way if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) black swan event happens i not only have money to invest i have money to live on should things go bad for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) while this philosophy enabled me to buy options when covid Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  without worrying if i could continue paying Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) mortgage for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) year without Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) job its also very useful if i have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions i took this from buffet fwiw
  options mostly UNOVA, Inc. (IN) tax advantaged accounts iras i aim for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  annual return overall with this portfolio though Gartner, Inc. (IT) fluctuates Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot year to year
  long term blue chips stocks like visa apple Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) etc i defend these positions when TODCO (THE) stocks Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) overheated by selling calls on them andor buying puts out of TODCO (THE) money that expire after Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) typical sector rotation would occur that can generate some additional income or help lessen TODCO (THE) sting if TODCO (THE) stock falls 
  longterm bets UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) roth ira these Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) equities i think Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) chance ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(IN) this portfolio of  on TODCO (THE) belief that Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few of TODCO (THE)  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) here will more than compensate for Gartner, Inc.

  leveraged hedgesthese Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) other things i cant mention due to TODCO (THE) bots UNOVA, Inc. (IN) here but they rhyme with tiptoe

use technologies to find ideas

unless you want to spend  hours Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) day reading news or Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) ok getting Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) your ideas from meme stocks and friends you need to use tools to help you locate investmenttrade ideas and BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) willing to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) for them i value my time and American Greetings Corporation (AM) willing to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY)  of my portfolio Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) year if Gartner, Inc. (IT) saves me time and more if Gartner, Inc. (IT) generates higher returns 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried about Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) dozen or Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) services including stock picking services like fool and investorsplace ultimately i decided TODCO (THE) stock picking sites were not working for me because i did not want to wait  years to find out if they were TODCO (THE) right recommendations and lost Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i switched to analytics tools and my fidelity platform 

my favorite tools to use Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) zacks vgm score levelfields and fidelity TODCO (THE) zacks vgm measures Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stocks value growth rate and momentum its AutoNation, Inc. (AN) easy screen i can run off TODCO (THE) basic level subscription to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) list of companies to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes TODCO (THE) companies on TODCO (THE) list Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) stale and have already moved  of TODCO (THE) way they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to move Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) you need to keep AutoNation, Inc. (AN) Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (EYE) on whats New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) to TODCO (THE) list to avoid losing money that part is crucial 

TODCO (THE) list usually represents companies that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) well valued and poised to move up over TODCO (THE) next  months warning they can move very slowly Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) patient and set your target exit to automatically exit i use fidelity to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) my own due diligence on TODCO (THE) stocks from there examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down TODCO (THE) price

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) friend recently turned me on to AutoNation, Inc. (AN) ai tool called levelfields they have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of news alerts but only for TODCO (THE) types of events that matter and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) organized thematically Gartner, Inc. (IT) helps me find trades on news events with high returns or Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) early on TODCO (THE) small to midcap companies you dont usually hear about which fall between TODCO (THE) cracks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites they often send alerts on Molson Coors Brewing (Company) events before theres any news out which is really helpful TODCO (THE) interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) its easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success   
i use Gartner, Inc. (IT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot for pinpointing entryexit points from options trades and have bought stock UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few companies i hadnt ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing Gartner, Inc. (IT) on revenue and earnings not sure why but they never came up UNOVA, Inc. (IN) any of my fidelity stock screens i suspect its because theres Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lag UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) data fidelity is getting from sp but havent confirmed this they send Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that theyd have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) better way to rank TODCO (THE) stocks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) alerts Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i didnt have to look up TODCO (THE) stocks on fidelity

i use fidelity for basic news reading running stock screens for high growth stocks ALLTEL Corporation (AT) decent valuations looking deeply ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) history of earnings results actually trading options and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity  i sell puts when i Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) abnormal call volume and run strangles if TODCO (THE) stock is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) midpoint UNOVA, Inc. (IN) its week price range UNOVA, Inc. (IN) case Gartner, Inc. (IT) shoots up and then down i always set AutoNation, Inc. (AN) automated exit

fidelity also Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) cool probability calculator for options i use when selling puts Gartner, Inc. (IT) tells you TODCO (THE) probability of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock falling below Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain range i use that number to determine where to sell puts without Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of risk i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) two standard deviations out and still buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like Gamestop Corporation (GME) and tsla my typical goal is to make  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) week from these plays which i use to fund New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) call positions

BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) wary of analyst opinions

if youve invested actively for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) while youve likely noticed Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) peculiar trend as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock is cratering analysts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) increasing their target purchase price on Gartner, Inc. (IT) this is not for your benefit brokerages often make investment recommendations based on TODCO (THE) research provided by their analysts Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) there is inherent bias UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) system 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks one study found less than  issued sell recommendations whats more TODCO (THE) track records of these analysts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) usually about TODCO (THE) same as coin flipping cnbc Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms eg goldman sachs says these  stocks Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) ready to explode but if you look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) actual analyst behind TODCO (THE) headline they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) often inexperienced or wrong more than right 

i American Greetings Corporation (AM) embarrassed to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) i lost Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted UNOVA, Inc. (IN) reality its easy to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) caught up UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) excitement of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) upgrade and if  analysts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) touting TODCO (THE) stock ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) same time Gartner, Inc. (IT) can create Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ponzi effect which is tradable but Gartner, Inc. (IT) boils down to needing to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) your own research

good things come UNOVA, Inc. (IN) pairs

just about every stock Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) peer or competitor most have several i stopped trying to pick TODCO (THE) winner and now place bets on multiple leaders iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) owned visa and mastercard i own olo and tost i have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) handful of um herbal medicine providers i like etsy and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) if you bet on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small group of competitors its likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially 

similarly Gartner, Inc. (IT) enables you to monitor TODCO (THE) news of competitors which many investors use as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) proxy what Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) i mean if mastercard reports Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) cross border transactions its highly probable visa will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) experiencing TODCO (THE) same thing Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) you can use TODCO (THE) information from mastercard to alter your position on visa

exercise financial discipline

even when iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been successful picking investments iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) run into problems with how to handle my successes weve Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) experienced TODCO (THE) thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher Gartner, Inc. (IT) will go thats usually TODCO (THE) moment iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned i should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) taking some gains Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few rules i try hard to follow but still screw up

 take profits often   
when AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option or stock hits  return i look to take some profit Gartner, Inc. (IT) may not seem possible if you only bought  call but Gartner, Inc. (IT) is just roll TODCO (THE) call to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) higher strike price and ensure TODCO (THE) credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return you can let TODCO (THE) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) call ride UNOVA, Inc. (IN) case TODCO (THE) stock gets going up this ensures you cannot lose money my rationale here is simple ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  gain i now have more to lose than i have to gain you will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) up  then down to  on TODCO (THE) same positions which makes me want to break things  
if you find yourself up huge on AutoNation, Inc. (AN) equity investment switch to options i did this for my baba position and Gartner, Inc. (IT) saved me when Gartner, Inc. (IT) Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT)  i was up  i sold Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) stock and bought options for TODCO (THE) same number of shares i had about Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) stock and switched to something like Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options when baba crashed down to  i really didnt care much i was only down Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) instead of Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) i had my profit of Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) locked UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) being down Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) was no big deal  

 fail Fastenal Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (FAST)   
if TODCO (THE) option price sinks to  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value its likely time to call Gartner, Inc. (IT) quits unless you have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) solid reason not to praying is not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strategy TODCO (THE) other half of TODCO (THE) value left can easily BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) eaten up by TODCO (THE) time decay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) option as i wait for TODCO (THE) turnaround and Gartner, Inc. (IT) gets closer to TODCO (THE) expiration date if theres negative news driving this Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) out i want to fail quickly that allows me time to take TODCO (THE) remaining  and generate gains with Gartner, Inc. (IT) on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) better investment i think this is TODCO (THE) hardest rule for me to stick to as i tend to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) optimist  

 profit both ways   
if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock i hold hits AutoNation, Inc. (AN) alltime high UNOVA, Inc. (IN) price or valuation i look for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) way to profit from TODCO (THE) downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts this enables you to stash some cash while riding TODCO (THE) volatility wave i hold visa and when Gartner, Inc. (IT) Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT)  headed into earnings i sold  calls and bought  puts this offset Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) paper loss for me of Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) yesterday alone by Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) gains which i secured as real profits assuming visa will recover that Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) adds  to this years returns for visa  

 BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) patient but not greedy   
i have learned TODCO (THE) hard way from selling positions days before they pop that Gartner, Inc. (IT) can take Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) while before TODCO (THE) market catches on to my investment idea especially if using good tools asset managers wealth managers and passive investors Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) usually looking for New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) investments every  months not daily Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) stocks can stay stuck UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) channel for some time before TODCO (THE) world catches on to its awesomeness example i held upstart from april to august this year and sold Gartner, Inc. (IT) because Gartner, Inc. (IT) was running flat Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple weeks later TODCO (THE) stock tripled fml were TODCO (THE) only words i could think of ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) time TODCO (THE) second thought i had was that i shouldve bought just one call option to replace TODCO (THE) stock i sold  
on TODCO (THE) flip side once Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock does move Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot higher dont BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) greedy what goes up Fastenal Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (FAST) can come down just as Fastenal Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (FAST) i feel Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot worse watching Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stockoption go up  then come down Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) way or more than i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) exiting with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  gain watching TODCO (THE) stock go up more dont chase TODCO (THE) perfect trade its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) white whale just make money  

 everyone Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) plan until you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) punched UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) mouth   
this is as true UNOVA, Inc. (IN) boxing thanks mike as Gartner, Inc. (IT) is investing thats why its essential to have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) plan Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) plan b should plan Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) not work out as you thought waiting through Gartner, Inc. (IT) can work but Gartner, Inc. (IT) isnt Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very effective strategy for navigating Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) changing environment   
Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) if my thesis is that TODCO (THE) stock will Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

remember that TODCO (THE) faster any asset climbs up TODCO (THE) faster Gartner, Inc. (IT) comes down like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) house of cards if Gartner, Inc.

(HAS) already taught me that no matter how this plays out i will never you only live once on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble ever again

TODCO (THE) principle seemed straightforward hedge funds got lazygreedy overshorted their positions bet against Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) that wasnt actually going under and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short squeeze even as someone who knows almost nothing about TODCO (THE) stock market TODCO (THE) basic premise makes sense but TODCO (THE) devils UNOVA, Inc.

Agilent Technologies, Inc.

id like to swing trade and here Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some things iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) picked up and would like corrected confirmed as well as some follow up

i have seen several swing trading strategy videos where AutoNation, Inc. (AN) rsi below  is Agilent Technologies, Inc.

is risk management pretty much as simple as understanding TODCO (THE) ratio of how much you can lose vs how much you can make paired with stop loss orders anything more UNOVA, Inc. (IN) depth on this is appreciated

i think i understand TODCO (THE) general difference between large cap and small cap companies but i dont understand why youd trade one over another Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) far TODCO (THE) only difference i Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) is that large cap appears more consistent which i assume is easier to play

what factors go into choosing your price range for stocks TODCO (THE) most consistent i Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) for swing trading is  obviously thats dependent on capital though given ill start with around  where should i aim TODCO (THE) main reason i ask is because TODCO (THE) more expensive Gartner, Inc. (IT) is TODCO (THE) less shares i own TODCO (THE) more TODCO (THE) stock Hasbro, Inc.

scenario 

lets Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hedge fund just opened Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(IN) hand to bolster TODCO (THE) stock both creating favorable conditions for TODCO (THE) puts that they sold and TODCO (THE) share that they purchased as cover if they want to add another level of manipulation to this they can also purchase call options which will result UNOVA, Inc. (IN) profit if TODCO (THE) stock price goes up UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this scenario hedge funds make money ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) expense of put option buyers and other shorts that Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy

scenario 

lets Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hedge fund just opened Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(IT) as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) potential growth stock this hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position by buying shares selling put options or buying call options Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) they try Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) different route keep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) mind that hedge funds Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) typically heavily invested UNOVA, Inc. (IN) many stocks and assets meaning they have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of power UNOVA, Inc.

(ARE) losing value Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) rapidly conveniently enough hedge funds own Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of these big name fang stocks

 if i American Greetings Corporation (AM) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) moderately sadistic hedge fund i can sell off Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) large holding of shares UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) scale of multi millions or billions that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) same sector as stock USX Corporation (X) which would incite fear across TODCO (THE) sector creating panic sell offs TODCO (THE) price will drop sharply across TODCO (THE) board including stock USX Corporation (X) and TODCO (THE) short position will produce big profits because this hedge fund sold off Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) large chunk of their shares ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good price they can now cover their short position essentially getting rid of Gartner, Inc. (IT) and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier only this time ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) much cheaper price TODCO (THE) hedge fund Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) now made money not only on TODCO (THE) short position but now they got into TODCO (THE) stock ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) cheap price UNOVA, Inc. (IN) which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster TODCO (THE) price again this can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) done by encouraging analyst upgrades publicizing newly purchased positions without disclosing TODCO (THE) fact that they previously owned Gartner, Inc. (IT) etc 

scenario 

this one involves technology algorithm trading commonly referred to as algo trading this one is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around algorithm trading is TODCO (THE) process of using highspeed supercomputers and Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(DO) not have to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) any direct manipulation of TODCO (THE) market which makes this  legal how this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and TODCO (THE) time Gartner, Inc. (IT) takes for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trade to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) made for you general investors we have mobile apps and webbased trading platforms to trade when we like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock we have to go through TODCO (THE) motion of inputting TODCO (THE) stock ticker symbol TODCO (THE) amount of shares TODCO (THE) price we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) willing to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD).

algorithm trading is integratable as part of TODCO (THE) buying and selling strategies mentioned UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) two previous scenarios which is why they can almost guarantee profit algorithm trading also uses Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of data UNOVA, Inc.

this disclosure makes sense UNOVA, Inc. (IN) that these legal protections have not been tested UNOVA, Inc. (IN) court for crpto assets specifically and Gartner, Inc.

if TODCO (THE) price were to drop by  TODCO (THE) net difference would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) additional  options that would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) executed because of TODCO (THE) contract price structuring  put options would become UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money

conversely if TODCO (THE) price went up by  TODCO (THE) net difference would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  extra contracts that would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) executed because of TODCO (THE) price structuring only two New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) call option strikes would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) executed between 

if we were to just look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) next five put option contracts below TODCO (THE) current strike price Gartner, Inc. (IT) equals up to  that means if TODCO (THE) price were to drop  they would need to find delivery for AutoNation, Inc. (AN) extra  shares

if TODCO (THE) price were to go up by  they would only need to find  extra shares to cover TODCO (THE) extra contracts that would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) itm ALLTEL Corporation (AT) 

let me Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) that again if TODCO (THE) price goes down Gartner, Inc. (IT) takes more shares off TODCO (THE) market because of TODCO (THE) put options going UNOVA, Inc. (IN) dollar increments while TODCO (THE) call options go up UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  increments

Gartner, Inc. (IT) is also interesting to note that ending TODCO (THE) week ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  would cause less deliveries than ending ALLTEL Corporation (AT) 

my hypothesis they cant hold TODCO (THE) price ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  this upcoming week simply due to TODCO (THE) lack of shares available and TODCO (THE) buyer demand staying Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) consistent we only had milmil volume TODCO (THE) last two days TODCO (THE) shares Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) drying up

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) if they cant hold TODCO (THE) price steady they need to decide which direction to move Gartner, Inc. (IT) and based on TODCO (THE) math moving TODCO (THE) price up would save TODCO (THE) shorts money by causing TODCO (THE) lesser of two evils UNOVA, Inc. (IN) extra deliveries

but one thing is for sure they cant let TODCO (THE) price tank any lower this upcoming week Gartner, Inc. (IT) would trigger too many New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) deliveries

theres actually some serious game theory that says TODCO (THE) best move to trigger TODCO (THE) squeeze would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) for us to allow TODCO (THE) price to drop to exactly  ALLTEL Corporation (AT) close of next week as odd as that seems

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) whats my nonfinanciallyadvisingcrystalball predict that this weeks close will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) on 



they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to allow some big singleday swings tuesday and wednesday to send TODCO (THE) stock price from  up to tickle TODCO (THE)  mark Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) that they can go ballsdeep selling Citigroup, Inc. (C) premium and then they will hold TODCO (THE) price just below TODCO (THE) line

TODCO (THE) next target after that would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  giggity as there is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) large offset of calls vs puts ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  that would cause TODCO (THE) delivery equilibrium to start going net positive again i just dont think theyre going to let us Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET)  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) single week as that would cause retail investor interest to start going up again

too long; didn'ALLTEL Corporation (AT)&T Inc. (T) read we end next week ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  and TODCO (THE) slow bleeding continues until TODCO (THE) week of feb

i immediately shit myself and stare ALLTEL Corporation (AT) my computer screen for about  minutes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) shock my account immediately reflects TODCO (THE) loss and Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) now down about  as reality slowly starts to set UNOVA, Inc. (IN) and i wipe TODCO (THE) tears away i decide to call my broker of course Ingram Micro Inc.

(HE) gets to work talking with his office to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) what Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) can Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) after about  more minutes i hear back apparently during TODCO (THE) time i was trying to buy my calls there was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  minute window that no trades were going through i put UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my market order and some how or another someone nabbed Gartner, Inc.

as i put my phone down i start to think about Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) amazing trades i could have made with this  and slowly come to terms with TODCO (THE) fact that  Ingram Micro Inc.

(ARE) not TODCO (THE) same and i American Greetings Corporation (AM) not here to bash either Gamestop Corporation (GME) or amc just pointing out some similarities between TODCO (THE) three i support Gamestop Corporation (GME) both amc and Gamestop Corporation (GME) full disclosure i American Greetings Corporation (AM) not TODCO (THE) first to point out these similarities but i have looked into them myself using TODCO (THE) charts i pulled off of TODCO (THE) sec website ALCAN, Inc. (AL) trades is where i first heard TODCO (THE) information about Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) week ASSURED GUARANTY LTD (AGO) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) youtube video and i just went and did some of my own digging to confirm TODCO (THE) information Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) provided 

looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) charts you Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) peaks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) ftds UNOVA, Inc. (IN) both Gamestop Corporation (GME) and amc before TODCO (THE) price run up for Gamestop Corporation (GME) happened  times and TODCO (THE) ftd pattern Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) Erie Indemnity Company (ERIE) correlation TODCO (THE) share price UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion 

TODCO (THE) peak ftds for Gamestop Corporation (GME) were just over m and gmes float is m according to google

m ftds  m shares  just over  of TODCO (THE) float 

TODCO (THE) peak ftds for amc were just over m and TODCO (THE) float according to google is m

m ftds  m shares  just over  of TODCO (THE) float 

TODCO (THE) peak ftds for clov were just over m and TODCO (THE) float according to google is m

m ftds  m shares  just over 

another thing i want to point out is that amc before Gartner, Inc. (IT) big run up had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) mini squeeze similar to what we saw from clov UNOVA, Inc. (IN) june 

amc went from around  to  then back down to  

clov went from  to  and is now UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE)  range which Gartner, Inc. (IT) Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple of weeks now is TODCO (THE) bottom UNOVA, Inc. (IN) for clov i dont really know but i hope Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) 

full disclosure i American Greetings Corporation (AM) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) clov shareholder and very bullish on clov from Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of my research i have done and that others have done 

i American Greetings Corporation (AM) not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) financial adviser and this is not financial advice just pointing out some things i Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) from TODCO (THE) charts 

i hope that everybody does theyre own due diligence before investing and hope that everybody makes some money investing

TODCO (THE) screen shots Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

(IN) i lost Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) entering TODCO (THE) trade on shorter dated puts 

Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) going to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) completely candid whether that gets me banned or not i will take that risk 

from TODCO (THE) moment i uttered this comment i set fourth TODCO (THE) most regarded scheme UNOVA, Inc. (IN) history 



ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) time frc hadnt halted trading i reached out to robinhood support to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) their stance on what would happen during Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) halt i didnt show TODCO (THE) full conversation but they were extremely unclear they said that i would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) short if i exercised but id have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hard time covering that short position although this is not saying yes or no its definitely terrible communication on their part 

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lawsuit based on TODCO (THE) hypothetical scenario we discussed is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) complete long shot out of curiosity i asked Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lawyer that day they said i was likely to win if robinhood backed out but they needed more details i did not trust this scummy lawyer i had another option  they have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) history of bending to social media backlash theres even this disclaimer when stocks Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) halted 



i thought i could increase TODCO (THE) odds by creating viral posts about robinhoods misdeeds hopefully robinhood would crack knowing their name was being smeared on TODCO (THE) front page of reddit wsb backing me would have been helpful but not necessary i just needed to make noise 

i believed TODCO (THE) chances i could cash out were high to begin with i was sortve right multiple brokers allowed exercising into Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short just not robinhood they still may have made AutoNation, Inc. (AN) exception as their support told me multiple times Gartner, Inc. (IT) might happen but i wasnt about to wait till expiration without Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fight 

within TODCO (THE) quest to fight robinhood i made this bet 



robinhood did not allow short selling for frc put holders as TODCO (THE) terms of TODCO (THE) bet demanded i sold TODCO (THE) contracts instead of exercising based on TODCO (THE) terms of TODCO (THE) bet i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not have to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) anything i still planned on donating Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few thousand until yesterday

whether this scheme would have worked i guess well never know frc began trading otc and exercising was not necessary anymore 

despite being correct iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) taken up Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reckless unsustainable trading approach if i continue on this path i will lose everything iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen Gartner, Inc.

(IN) things they have no business buying this is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) extremely slippery slope for me iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) blown up multiple accounts and i refuse to make TODCO (THE) same mistake i hope i can set AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example dont keep rolling TODCO (THE) dice take TODCO (THE) money and run 

i know its very obvious to everyone cashing out is TODCO (THE) smart thing to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) but UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my position TODCO (THE) rush of euphoria from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) massive win like this is intoxicating TODCO (THE) sobering despair of previous losses melts away its very hard to fight TODCO (THE) imaginative ideas of becoming Agilent Technologies, Inc.

present moment

i saw pacw tanking after hours based on news that they were looking for sellers they had already said this UNOVA, Inc. (IN) their er that they were looking to sell assets i felt TODCO (THE) drop overblown fear from frcs collapse

                  technical analysis

let me start with my ta firstwhich is alarming  

this was yesterday friday september 

here is one from thursday september 



SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) critical resistance leveli meanit literally is hitting TODCO (THE) fucking roof here and with everything going on UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) worldyou want more sorry to burst your bubblebut how was that even theoretically feasible its impossible UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion 

let me explain why

              updated gdp forecasts

American Greetings Corporation (AM) i literally TODCO (THE) only one who saw on thursday that morgan stanley updated their forecast for TODCO (THE) third quarter gdp expectations let me fill you UNOVA, Inc. (IN) on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) little secretthey cut their fucking estimates by more than half

for fuck sakes people this is huge this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) quote from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) brand New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) article literally posted  minutes ASSURED GUARANTY LTD (AGO) from TODCO (THE) washington post 

TODCO (THE) team ALLTEL Corporation (AT) morgan stanley led by chief us economist ellen zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to  from 

gross domestic product is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) KeyCorp (KEY) indicator of economic activity UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) united states soyeah were fucked which UNOVA, Inc. (IN) turn Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) impact on some companies future earnings and we Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) know that wall street Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) extremely high expectations now 

             wall streets high expectations

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) far  of s and p  companies have beaten earnings Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share estimates for TODCO (THE) second quarter of  according to data provider factset

TODCO (THE) strong results put TODCO (THE) s and p  on track to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) best quarter for beats since factset started tracking TODCO (THE) data UNOVA, Inc. (IN)   Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) what happens if TODCO (THE) economy literally comes to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stand still which UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen you could have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) slow correction based on this alone just on companies missing earningswhich i guarantee that will happen its going to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) earnings miss galore 

                     lumbergold ratio

simply put when lumber goes up that means people Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) building homes and buying homes and Gartner, Inc. (IT) is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) metric of strong economic growth

when Randgold Resources Limited (GOLD) goes down safe haven assest less risk that is associated with times where stocks and real estate Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) up which makes them more attractive and Randgold Resources Limited (GOLD) less attractive

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing AutoNation, Inc. (AN) active portfolio

this ratio calculates how many contracts of lumber you can buy with AutoNation, Inc. (AN) ounce of Randgold Resources Limited (GOLD)

Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Gartner, Inc. (IT) good now feast your eyes on this   

i like this one better compared to TODCO (THE) Dow Chemical Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (DOW)  


TODCO (THE) lumbergold ratio Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) plummeted UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) last  monthsliterally fucking straight down which is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) KeyCorp (KEY) indicator for AutoNation, Inc. (AN) upcoming correctioncrash rememberplay defense

(A) very surprising miss i wasnt surprised ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) honest with you


                      conclusion

calls explained

buying calls is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bullish strategy and TODCO (THE) most popular on this sub and thus will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) covered first  i will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) using Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) as my example stock  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is currently trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  and i believe that TODCO (THE) sale of TODCO (THE) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) xbox around christmas time will increase TODCO (THE) stock price to  by christmas  i would buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call  i decide to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) dec  options which you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) below



this is robinhood on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) computer  ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) top you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) what each thing is which is explained below

 strike price  TODCO (THE) price TODCO (THE) stock Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) to rise above to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) exercised
 break even  TODCO (THE) price TODCO (THE) stock Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) to rise above to not lose money

  strike price  out of TODCO (THE) money could not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) immediately exercised

TODCO (THE) break even point is always higher than TODCO (THE) strike price for calls as you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) paying someone to accept risk  this can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) calculated by taking TODCO (THE) strike price and adding TODCO (THE) premium paid for TODCO (THE) option  for TODCO (THE)         TODCO (THE) option can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) exercised below TODCO (THE) break even for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) loss

buying calls

ok Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE)   strike is what we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to buy that is  dollars Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share for  shares Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) buyer would Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) total of  for TODCO (THE) trade depending on TODCO (THE) bid  ask explained UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) details below  we go ahead AutoNation, Inc. (AN) buy that option for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) debit of 

as TODCO (THE) month goes on before  some things could happen

 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes up TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) option increases and can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) sold for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profit ALLTEL Corporation (AT) any time
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes down TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) option decreases and can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) sold for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) loss ALLTEL Corporation (AT) any time
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) trades sideways which will result UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) option decreasing explained UNOVA, Inc. (IN) greeks

on  if you still hold TODCO (THE) option there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few possibilities

 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is above TODCO (THE) breakeven well Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY)  you can sell TODCO (THE) option for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profit which would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) almost entirely intrinsic value TODCO (THE) contract would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worth around        this is Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) your profit would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  USX Corporation (X)       TODCO (THE)  is TODCO (THE) debit paid for TODCO (THE) contract
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is above TODCO (THE) strike but below TODCO (THE) breakeven well Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY)   TODCO (THE) contract will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very close to break even and throughout TODCO (THE) day will likely fluctuate to above and below  if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) still bullish on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) this is TODCO (THE) only time i would recommend exercising TODCO (THE) option to buy TODCO (THE) share and only if you have TODCO (THE) capital to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO)  if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) bearish or Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not have TODCO (THE) capital your best bet would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) to sell TODCO (THE) option for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) slight loss  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this case Gartner, Inc. (IT) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) around   note robinhood risk management will automatically sell options if you Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not have TODCO (THE) capital to exercise them and Gartner, Inc. (IT) is close to TODCO (THE) strike on TODCO (THE) day of expiration
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is below TODCO (THE) strike hold or sell to avoid max loss  your max loss UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) trade is  dollars and TODCO (THE) stock may run up towards TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) day  if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) finishes TODCO (THE) day below TODCO (THE) strike TODCO (THE) option will expire worthless

selling naked calls

if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) neutral to bearish on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) because you think TODCO (THE) ps will outsell TODCO (THE) xbox you could sell TODCO (THE)  Citigroup, Inc. (C)  Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) below



notice to break even turns into chance of profit  this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) calculation using TODCO (THE) greeks of your odds of coming out on top UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this trade  you sell this call  this would mean you would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) credited with  dollars initially  as TODCO (THE) month goes on if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes up UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value you will begin to lose money on TODCO (THE) trade and if you desired to close TODCO (THE) trade you would have to buy to close meaning you payed more for TODCO (THE) option then you sold Gartner, Inc. (IT) for  if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) trades sideways or decreases UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value TODCO (THE) options contract will decrease and you can buy to close TODCO (THE) call ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lower price than what you paid for Gartner, Inc. (IT) or just let Gartner, Inc. (IT) expire worthless on 

selling naked calls can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very risky  if you sell TODCO (THE) call and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) shoots up TODCO (THE) next day to  TODCO (THE) buyer of your contract can immediately exercise TODCO (THE) call  this means that you as TODCO (THE) seller Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) obligated to sell them  shares of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) ALLTEL Corporation (AT)   what happens if you dont have them you have to buy them ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) current market price  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO)  USX Corporation (X)     you would then sell them for   your max loss on TODCO (THE) trade will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)        and that is only if TODCO (THE) price goes to   if TODCO (THE) price ALLTEL Corporation (AT) expiration is  your max loss would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)   for every  increase UNOVA, Inc. (IN) underlying TODCO (THE) max loss increases   to avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) discussed later

puts explained

buying puts is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bearish strategy and TODCO (THE) second most popular on this sub  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is still  and i believe TODCO (THE) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) xbox sucks  i think TODCO (THE) stock will fall to  on or before   below Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE)  puts



none of TODCO (THE) metrics change except for what is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) and out of TODCO (THE) money

   UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money can immediately BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) exercised but TODCO (THE) buyerexerciser would experience Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) loss
   out of TODCO (THE) money cannot immediately BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) exercised

buying puts

TODCO (THE)   strike is what we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to buy Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) that is  for  shares Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) if purchased and filled this would Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) us  dollars  note this is much more expensive than TODCO (THE)  call this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) result of TODCO (THE) strike price being much closer to TODCO (THE) current stock price

as TODCO (THE) month goes on before  some things could happen

 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes down TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) option increases and can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) sold for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profit ALLTEL Corporation (AT) any time

on  if you still hold TODCO (THE) option there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few possibilities

 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is below TODCO (THE) breakeven well Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY)  you can sell TODCO (THE) option for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profit which would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) almost entirely intrinsic value worth around        again Perot Systems Corporation (PER) share minus TODCO (THE) debit would again Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) us around   notice how this trades profit was lower with TODCO (THE) same difference UNOVA, Inc. (IN) strike price to underlying price on expiration that is because TODCO (THE) premium we paid for this trade was higher
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is below TODCO (THE) strike price but above TODCO (THE) breakeven well Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY)   TODCO (THE) contract will very throughout TODCO (THE) day and unless you have TODCO (THE) capital to exercise robinhood risk management will likely sell TODCO (THE) thing whether you like Gartner, Inc. (IT) or not
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is above TODCO (THE) strike price you can sell to minimize profit or hold until Gartner, Inc. (IT) expires worthless

selling naked puts

if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) neutral to bullish on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) because you think TODCO (THE) xbox will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) meh you could sell TODCO (THE)  p  this means you would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) credited with   if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) decreases UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value TODCO (THE) option price will increase UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value and you will lose money on TODCO (THE) trade  you can hold to expiration or buy to close ALLTEL Corporation (AT) any time for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) loss  if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) trades sideways or increases UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value TODCO (THE) option will decrease UNOVA, Inc.

TODCO (THE) same risk applies to selling naked puts as naked calls but is capped as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock cannot go below zero

options pricing

TODCO (THE) price of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) two different parts intrinsic and extrinsic value

 intrinsic value  current price  strike price
    AutoNation, Inc. (AN) out of TODCO (THE) money option Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) no intrinsic value
    AutoNation, Inc. (AN) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money option Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) intrinsic value equal to TODCO (THE) difference UNOVA, Inc. (IN) stock price and strike price
    example  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) price   for TODCO (THE)  Citigroup, Inc. (C) this option Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) intrinsic value of  for each share or   but you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) figure  Gartner, Inc. (IT) is  or  dollars to buy  that is where extrinsic value comes into play
 extrinsic value
    effected by theta and implied volatility
    can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) calculated by extrinsic value  option price  intrinsic value
    theta
       TODCO (THE) more time AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) to expiration TODCO (THE) higher Gartner, Inc. (IT) is priced  this is because TODCO (THE) underlying stock Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) more time to move
       TODCO (THE) theta curve accelerates around TODCO (THE)  day mark Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) figure below  you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that as AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option gets closer to its expiration Gartner, Inc. (IT) will lose value regardless of if Gartner, Inc. (IT) is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) or out of TODCO (THE) money Gartner, Inc. (IT) will depreciate



 implied volatility  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of math goes into this one but its essentially how much Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock is likely to move during Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) give amount of time
    steady stocks like Coca-Cola Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (KO) tend to have lower iv
    high growth stock or stocks that move Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot have higher iv
    TODCO (THE) iv of each option will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) different depending on expiration date how far UNOVA, Inc. (IN) or out of TODCO (THE) money TODCO (THE) stock is and TODCO (THE) movement of TODCO (THE) underlying
    iv crush  this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing  even with no movement UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) underlying AutoNation, Inc. (AN) options price can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) cut UNOVA, Inc. (IN) half if TODCO (THE) volatility drastically decreases decreasing TODCO (THE) extrinsic value  BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) careful if you hold options over Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stocks earnings

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) i have to hold to expiration

lets Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) we buy TODCO (THE) Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)  Citigroup, Inc. (C)  Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) we have to wait until december  no  if TODCO (THE) underlying increases to lets Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY)  by next friday  we could sell TODCO (THE) option for likely Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pretty good profit  we payed  for TODCO (THE) contract but TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) call may increase to  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) we could sell to close for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  profit allowing us to move on to another trade  but as we approach TODCO (THE) strike delta increases and therefore may BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worth holding  TODCO (THE) break even information is only if you intend to hold TODCO (THE) call to expiration and profit from exercising and then immediately selling TODCO (THE) shares back into TODCO (THE) market  due to time and market craziness i recommend taking profit from TODCO (THE) option itself rather than exercising and using TODCO (THE) shares

open interest is important as well  if very Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) open interest selling or buying to close may BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very difficult depending on how popular TODCO (THE) options contract is

TODCO (THE) lower TODCO (THE) open interest and TODCO (THE) wider TODCO (THE) bidask spread is TODCO (THE) more likely you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) every market bubble you always hear TODCO (THE) same language TODCO (THE) same rationalizations TODCO (THE) same absurd arguments these people think they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) offering some New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) unique insight UNOVA, Inc. (IN) reality Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) they offer Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) same manic rationalizations that existed UNOVA, Inc. (IN) every other bubble market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) history lets address TODCO (THE) primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into TODCO (THE) bear thesis

xb

 interest rates Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) nowhere for money to go except stocks

when you really drill down into Gartner, Inc. (IT) this is some bizarre logic its essentially saying you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) less profitable UNOVA, Inc. (IN) other words its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) manifestation of TODCO (THE) greedy fear of missing out mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles

ultimately these bull arent even arguing that we arent UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) arguing we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble but that TODCO (THE) bubble is justified

TODCO (THE) obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lowinterest rate environment whats TODCO (THE) worst that can happen if i sit on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pure cash portfolio i lose  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) year not good of course but not TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) world either whats TODCO (THE) worst that can happen if i dump Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) my money into stocks ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) time highs and TODCO (THE) market crashes i lose  of my funds UNOVA, Inc. (IN) as little as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) month ouch

TODCO (THE) idea that Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) forced to risk losing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) huge percentage of my capital because losing  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) year is simply impossible to endure is TODCO (THE) sort of logic that can only arise under Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) euphoric bubble mindset

of course TODCO (THE) premise that these bulls Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) relying on is that TODCO (THE) market simply wont crash or that they will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) prescient enough to calmly hop out of TODCO (THE) market once Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crash becomes obvious but TODCO (THE) whole point is that TODCO (THE) crash is never obvious especially to permabulls they Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) dip and they buy Gartner, Inc. (IT) they Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) deeper dip what Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) great opportunity Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) they buy more and before they realize TODCO (THE) dip isnt simply Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) dip they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) already fucked tale as old as time

TODCO (THE) funny thing is this argument can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational why hold cash when bonds Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) more why buy bonds when index funds Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) more why buy index funds when spacs Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) more why buy spacs when flipping cocaine pays more after Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since Gartner, Inc. (IT) loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify

whats most interesting is that this argument isnt even New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) TODCO (THE) ridiculously Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) interest rates set by TODCO (THE) fed UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) past were precisely what sowed TODCO (THE) seeds for TODCO (THE) massive housing bubble that led to TODCO (THE)  crash TODCO (THE) fed is ultimately Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble creator something even wsb is well aware of

 if you sit out this rally you will end up behind even if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) right

this is perhaps TODCO (THE) most popular argument of permabulls they argue that if you sat out TODCO (THE) last  months something this is essentially Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) straw Manpower Inc (MAN) argument except UNOVA, Inc. (IN) reference to permabears then you would have missed out on massive gains and therefore TODCO (THE) implicit argument is you can never sit out

if you carefully analyze this argument you will realize Gartner, Inc. (IT) is literally nothing more than fear of missing out to TODCO (THE) extreme its fear of missing out disguised as macroeconomic theory i have to stay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market perpetually i can never sit out because if i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) i will miss out on gains and you better stay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy

first of Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) i will admit this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good argument against people who Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) legitimately permabears people who Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) sit out Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) fear for months and months Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

AutoNation, Inc. (AN) intelligent investor is neither Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bull nor Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bear they adapt to TODCO (THE) market and when AutoNation, Inc.

options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) becoming TODCO (THE) vehicle of choice for investors aka gamblers UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) current market stock represents actual ownership of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) TODCO (THE) foundation of TODCO (THE) actual market but what kind of boomer wants to actually invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profitable Molson Coors Brewing (Company) long term i just want to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) insane leverage and dump my gamble on TODCO (THE) next bigger sucker

TODCO (THE) question i sometimes ask is how much of this market growth is really Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume you know like derivative cdos leveraging worthless mortgages back UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  its something to think about

ill just leave this chart here since Gartner, Inc. (IT) makes TODCO (THE) case for me this is neither natural nor sustainable



 greater fool logic

ill just quote investopedia since Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) getting lazy here

TODCO (THE) greater fool theory states that Gartner, Inc. (IT) is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) overvalued by selling them for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profit ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) later date this is because there will always BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) someone ie Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bigger or greater fool who is willing to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) higher price

if acting UNOVA, Inc. (IN) accordance with TODCO (THE) greater fool theory AutoNation, Inc. (AN) investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality if TODCO (THE) theory holds TODCO (THE) investor will still BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to quickly sell them off to another greater fool who could also BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) hoping to flip them quickly unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) rapid depreciation UNOVA, Inc. (IN) share prices

TODCO (THE) greater fool theory breaks down UNOVA, Inc. (IN) other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  when investors purchased faulty mortgagebacked securities Gartner, Inc. (IT) was difficult to find buyers when TODCO (THE) market collapsed

basically none of you mouthbreathers Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) doing fundamental analysis on TODCO (THE) shit you buy nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value this is talking about you



 buffet indicator through TODCO (THE) roof

TODCO (THE) buffet indicator Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) reach its highest ever level for noobies who dont know what this means TODCO (THE) buffett indicator takes total market valuation and divides Gartner, Inc. (IT) by us gdp Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very high buffett indicator suggests AutoNation, Inc. (AN) overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as TODCO (THE) dotcom boom

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) two arguments against TODCO (THE) buffett indicator as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) useful metric TODCO (THE) first argument is that gdp is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) backward indicator and therefore doesnt account for future growth while this is true Gartner, Inc. (IT) misses TODCO (THE) entire point TODCO (THE) point is that future growth estimations can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles TODCO (THE) point is to Titanium Metals Corporation (TIE) market valuations to some realworld metric which is necessarily backward looking

TODCO (THE) other argument against TODCO (THE) buffett indicator which holds more weight is that us stocks consist of global companies and therefore arent adequately represented by us gdp

i will Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) these people have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good point but they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) also missing several nuances within gdp and market valuations which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) too complicated to address UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this already fucking huge post suffice Gartner, Inc. (IT) to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) TODCO (THE) buffett indicator still Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) something useful to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) about market valuation and cant simply BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) discarded



 valuations divorced from reality

during every major bubble people like to come up with New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) fancy ways of evaluating TODCO (THE) worth of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) back UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued UNOVA, Inc. (IN) terms of eyes that is TODCO (THE) value of TODCO (THE) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) was based on how many visits they had to their website

this internet thing was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) paradigm and Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) obviously we needed New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) metrics to determine how valuable these companies were needless to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) TODCO (THE) vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight

take your pick of favorite meme stonk that Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation i like to pick on tesla personally because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good Cedar Fair, L.P. (FUN)



 fed manipulation

most bubbles have been created by federal reserve control of currency and interest rates this market is no different they create Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble and when TODCO (THE) bubble pops they hop UNOVA, Inc. (IN) to create Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) New Century Financial Corp.

that means Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) was even smarter than we thought and heres TODCO (THE) proof

this is without even getting into TODCO (THE) speculative world of crypt where  for more than half Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) billion dollars Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) coin that started as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) literal joke Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) market cap of  billion and there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) now more ICOS Corporation (ICOS) than anyone can keep track of

investor expectations

more than TODCO (THE) pe ratio investor expectations seem to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) highest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) recent history TODCO (THE) pricetosales ratio shows how much TODCO (THE) market values every dollar of TODCO (THE) companys sales as we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) on TODCO (THE) chart below more than double TODCO (THE) companies Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trading above USX Corporation (X) their sales when compared to TODCO (THE)  dot com bubble



if you consider Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  stocks that had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very high ps ratio have underperformed those having Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) ps ratio since most companies dont grow as Perot Systems Corporation (PER) expectations



now thats Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of bad news for anyone to digest but

Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) we certain its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) multiple factors that can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) attributed to TODCO (THE) current rally just because we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) impressive rally Gartner, Inc. (IT) does not mean TODCO (THE) only eventual outcome is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble and subsequent crash lets look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) KeyCorp (KEY) factors that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) driving up TODCO (THE) stock prices over TODCO (THE) last few years

lowinterest rates

this is one of TODCO (THE) KeyCorp (KEY) aspects that many miss while comparing TODCO (THE) current rally to TODCO (THE) s dotcom bubble between  and  TODCO (THE) fed rate varied from    compared to TODCO (THE) historically Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW)  that we have now this means that TODCO (THE) capital available now is much cheaper to prop up TODCO (THE) economy after covid than Gartner, Inc. (IT) ever was this is bound to have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive impact on TODCO (THE) stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to TODCO (THE) stock market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) search of better returns



New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) investors

its no secret that we Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) hate robinhood but TODCO (THE) data they put out during their ipo filing shows that there Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) staggering growth UNOVA, Inc. (IN) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) investorstraders coming to TODCO (THE) market Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of these New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) investors would bring fresh capital into TODCO (THE) market triggering another bull run which we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) experiencing now



Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) and index funds

as i have highlighted UNOVA, Inc. (IN) s TODCO (THE) amount of inflow us index funds receive is massive more than  billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just TODCO (THE) vanguard  index fund this year and index funds Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) expected to make up  according to  from fidelity TODCO (THE) average Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) account now Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) balance of Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) and  of workers increased their contribution

TODCO (THE) KeyCorp (KEY) point being Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) this New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) capital that is being allocated into TODCO (THE) index funds is expected to cause Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) rise UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) overall valuation of TODCO (THE) stock market 

whats TODCO (THE) implication

as long as TODCO (THE) above factors remain as is fed maintaining its rate and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) steady supply of fresh capital we might Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) party go on much longer than expected

conclusion

TODCO (THE) market of  is significantly different when compared to TODCO (THE) s as we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) more investors cheaper capital and even more passive funds that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) flowing into TODCO (THE) market than ever before Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i feel that looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) current market and comparing Gartner, Inc. (IT) directly to TODCO (THE) dotcom bubble is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) tad wrong

but thats not to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) that Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) is well almost Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) fundamental indicators Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) flashing red and even TODCO (THE) experts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) predicting Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) significant drawdown UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) near future

TODCO (THE) expected annual return by investors above inflation is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) whopping  which is  more than what is realistic  this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) testament to TODCO (THE) euphoria we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) seeing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market now where Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) yearly doubledigit return is TODCO (THE) norm



even if we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) dotcom bubblelike scenario  perfectly summarizes TODCO (THE) issues with making money calling Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) middle of TODCO (THE) bubble

basically even though everyone knew Gartner, Inc. (IT) was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bubble back UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  investment firms did entire conferences comparing TODCO (THE) internet companies to tulip mania as early as  making money using that information was hard there were Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few investors such as mark cuban and john templeton who successfully shorted TODCO (THE) stocks ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) peak of TODCO (THE) bubble and made Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) killing when TODCO (THE) market crashed but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting AutoNation, Inc. (AN) overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected

Gartner, Inc. (IT) makes perfect sense to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) apprehensive about investing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) current market but pundits have been calling Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  right now based on fundamentals TODCO (THE) chances Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) look far higher Gartner, Inc. (IT) does make sense to not make significant onetime investments UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market now but changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) best longterm strategy

trading strategy,wallstreetbets,GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,"i made Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) comment yesterday on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) post that did some technical analysis on Gamestop Corporation (GME) and several people asked that i turn that comment into Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) post Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) here Gartner, Inc. (IT) is

obviously Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) going to start by saying Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark TODCO (THE) squeeze

first TODCO (THE) comment as Gartner, Inc. (IT) was

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen lots of bullish ta on Gamestop Corporation (GME) keep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) mind Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) ta requires volume to play out how Gartner, Inc. (IT) should we havent had any volume on Gamestop Corporation (GME) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) over Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) week

holding shares simply isnt enough  needs constant Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) day every single day buying of shares and UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money options

if you buy options that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE)  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money they literally cant price pin because they cant Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) and keep TODCO (THE) price  below current market Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge and virtually eliminate their means of counterattack which Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been price pinning ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) point of maximum pain price ALLTEL Corporation (AT) which most contracts expire worthless

if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) intending to help push TODCO (THE) squeeze buy shares throughout TODCO (THE) day every day if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) playing options mostly buy calls UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money if youre buying otm calls buy as close to current price as you can afford TODCO (THE) more imbalanced otm calls Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) more theyre just going to price pin ALLTEL Corporation (AT) maximum pain they literally cannot Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this if there is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ridiculous amount of New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) itm call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge

essentially we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with gamestop there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) two major reasons 

 manipulation we cannot Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) anything about this really aside from buy and hold technicals actually have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) tendencies to work UNOVA, Inc. (IN) reverse when Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock is being manipulated ALLTEL Corporation (AT) these levels TODCO (THE) shorts while stuck UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stupid position arent stupid they know when TODCO (THE) ta is indicating Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bullish setup and that is TODCO (THE) best time for them to attack TODCO (THE) stock to break TODCO (THE) setup

 volume Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) technical setups require volume to play out if volume doesnt follow TODCO (THE) technical setup fails and TODCO (THE) price action is unpredictable except UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this case Gartner, Inc. (IT) goes down because its being shorted ALLTEL Corporation (AT) every chance

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) what Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) we need to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) hold yes but that cant BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Gartner, Inc. (IT) if we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) doing nothing but holding this will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient they can literally hold us UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stalemate for monthsyears if volume never shows up to move TODCO (THE) price yes they Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) more interest TODCO (THE) longer they have to wait theyll just manipulate other sectors of TODCO (THE) market to force gains and cover their losses unless TODCO (THE) sec steps UNOVA, Inc. (IN) to stop market manipulation 

volume

without volume there is no endgame look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) every day weve had spikes look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) volume now look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) past week or two we arent making progress because nobody is buying shares aside from some whale algos that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) simply fighting off TODCO (THE) short attacks believe Gartner, Inc. (IT) or not TODCO (THE) whales Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) need retail support to force TODCO (THE) squeeze TODCO (THE) whales Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) ones creating momentum from time to time if Gartner, Inc. (IT) catches on they can follow Gartner, Inc. (IT) up but if they just go Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) out to create Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) surge and nobody follows behind them to buy they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) literally risking billions of dollars to fail

this thing will likely happen UNOVA, Inc. (IN) waves over TODCO (THE) course of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few days if you look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) any day there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) surges UNOVA, Inc. (IN) buy volume but theyre short thats likely Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) whale testing TODCO (THE) market if they Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) confirmationfollowup from TODCO (THE) market its less risky for them to send Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) second wave of buying pressure Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) something like whale buy retail confirmation buys whale buy runaway effect gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of those things have to happen consecutively fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack

now this is going to sound counterintuitive but UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to catalyze TODCO (THE) squeeze we have to stop just buying TODCO (THE) dip when volume picks up and TODCO (THE) price is spiking thats TODCO (THE) most important time to buy thats TODCO (THE) point when additional buying pressure is most important and until TODCO (THE) retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to keep bouncing back and forth

options

TODCO (THE) other side of TODCO (THE) coin is options purchases stop devoting TODCO (THE) majority of your capital to far otm lotto tickets this helps TODCO (THE) short positions because Gartner, Inc. (IT) forces TODCO (THE) market makers to help TODCO (THE) shorts market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk when you buy AutoNation, Inc. (AN) Citigroup, Inc. (C) Gartner, Inc. (IT) does two things

 they dont have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral

 UNOVA, Inc. (IN) incentivizes TODCO (THE) market makers to pin TODCO (THE) price

you can Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) some additional reading on max pain price UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options but Gartner, Inc. (IT) is essentially TODCO (THE) closing price ALLTEL Corporation (AT) which TODCO (THE) largest number of options expire worthless when you buy otm call options youre increasing TODCO (THE) maximum pain price which makes Gartner, Inc. (IT) easier for market makers and shorts to pin TODCO (THE) price there

if however youre buying Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ton of itm call options youre doing two things

 deep itm calls have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) delta of essentially  this means that UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to remain risk neutral TODCO (THE) market makers essentially Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) to buy  shares immediately upon selling you TODCO (THE) contract

 Gartner, Inc. (IT) lowers TODCO (THE) max pain price by creating AutoNation, Inc. (AN) imbalance towards lower strikes having TODCO (THE) most Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) this means UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to pin TODCO (THE) price ALLTEL Corporation (AT) max pain they would need to drop Gartner, Inc. (IT) from its current price

not only Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) you force market makers to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) risk neutral immediately meaning they dont care where TODCO (THE) price goes you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on TODCO (THE) stock price

if you must buy otm calls buy ones that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least closer to being itm TODCO (THE) further otm you buy calls TODCO (THE) more likely TODCO (THE) price will go sideways you can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as TODCO (THE) price increases once Gartner, Inc. (IT) achieves Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) runaway squeeze which will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) easy to identify you can start buying your lotto tickets

too long; didn'ALLTEL Corporation (AT)&T Inc. (T) read UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion if you want to help catalyze TODCO (THE) squeeze you need to buy shares when TODCO (THE) price is spiking and buy calls that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

hope this helps somehow","Gartner, Inc. (IT) took me Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) year of programming to develop my own indicators and put them together to build Agilent Technologies, Inc.

understand what support and resistance is not TODCO (THE) conventional lines but TODCO (THE) actual supply and demand zones these Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) areas where big money either sees TODCO (THE) asset undervalued enough to buy or overvalued enough to sell 
once you have that UNOVA, Inc. (IN) place you can then add indicators or whatever on your charts to help give you Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) clear picture of TODCO (THE) reactions to these zones of interest

(A) pattern that repeats frequently and does not depend Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) much on market changes for example UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my case Gartner, Inc. (IT) is breakouts of recent pivot highs and lows write some very specific rules for example consider Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pivot high or Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) when Gartner, Inc. (IT) is TODCO (THE) highestlowest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) set of  bars then consider Agilent Technologies, Inc.

trading strategy,Forex,My Trading Strategy and Setup,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been trading for  years and have been finding some success this year and now starting to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) comfortable with TODCO (THE) setups i look for i started with fx and later added Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) variety of cfds for spx metals commodities and bonds not here to tell you guys how to trade nor American Greetings Corporation (AM) i looking for critique on my strategy i posted this on my profile but figured id share my story here as Gartner, Inc. (IT) might BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) interesting for New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) traders

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trading strategy is ever evolving and never finished especially if you can surround yourself with other like minded traders and you collectively try to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) better i went from basic ma crosses on TODCO (THE)  and min to high probability setups on TODCO (THE) weekly and monthly

my nr indicator

TODCO (THE) bollinger bands got me excited right off TODCO (THE) bat when i started backtesting them my strategy is to look for candles that greatly overextend outside of TODCO (THE) upper or lower band and then counter TODCO (THE) move as they will often shoot back UNOVA, Inc. (IN) like AutoNation, Inc. (AN) elastic band as candles like to stay within TODCO (THE) bands

i look for these setups on TODCO (THE) weekly and monthly chart as TODCO (THE) shorter tfs give Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of poor signals AutoNation, Inc. (AN) overextension on TODCO (THE)  hour will only need Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of consolidation and maybe Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) minor pullback before Gartner, Inc. (IT) can easily continue its trend

its always hard to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) how far AutoNation, Inc. (AN) overextension will go look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) ng rogue wave and how long Gartner, Inc. (IT) will take before Gartner, Inc. (IT) pulls back UNOVA, Inc. (IN) to tackle this challenge i scale UNOVA, Inc. (IN) with one small position ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) time and trading TODCO (THE) cfd makes this very easy as you can trade Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) really small size when needed i jump UNOVA, Inc. (IN) too early almost every single time as i dont want to miss TODCO (THE) move but thats fine as TODCO (THE) positions Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) small with wide stops

pullback or reversal

you cant just blindly trade every setup of course but by following these moves on TODCO (THE) higher tfs theres ample time to research fundamentals and such to determine where price might go and if were trading Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pullback or reversal i treat every trade initially as just Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) temporary pullback then later on if its starting to look like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) possible reversal i might set some positions ALLTEL Corporation (AT) BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) to let those ride

other tools i use

another trusted indicator is TODCO (THE) macdrsi crossover these Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) highly lagging but plotting them on TODCO (THE) daily and weekly gives me Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pretty good sense of whether TODCO (THE) directional pressure is up or down i also use Masco Corporation (MAS) historical sr price levels and round numbers that help with TODCO (THE) entries and exits

like Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) indicators these arent generating guaranteed setups its just another piece of TODCO (THE) puzzle but if enough pieces fit together TODCO (THE) setups can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very high probability

examples of TODCO (THE) signals or setups i look for

here is AutoNation, Inc. (AN)  where i marked TODCO (THE) macdrsi crossovers TODCO (THE) actual cross precedes TODCO (THE) reversal and i dont act on that but once TODCO (THE) macd line red exits TODCO (THE) histogram grey bars TODCO (THE) reversal happens or is already underway since were looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) weekly chart were also working with large moves that can go on for weeks what i then Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) is only trade TODCO (THE) direction TODCO (THE) indicator gives me and keep scaling UNOVA, Inc. (IN) and out with small positions and wide stops until TODCO (THE) signal becomes weak or risky this chart is obviously Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) great hindsight example and not every cross signals Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reversal but whenever this setup occurs TODCO (THE) bells start ringing and i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) my E.I. du Pont Deere & Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DE) Nemours and Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DD)

silver just had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) great bollinger setup overextended on TODCO (THE)  and floating outside of TODCO (THE) bands on TODCO (THE)  still felt Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) little risky due to my lack of experience with silver but i scaled UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  times and caught Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) large part of that retracement

TODCO (THE) challenging bond shorts i started too early and cut yesterday Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) hindsight just another monthly bollinger overextension that snapped right back down looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  and 

i mostly trade these bollinger setups on TODCO (THE) weekly and monthly Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) they dont occur that often which is why i follow Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of instruments

i also try to trade with more conviction if i Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good setupthere is no point UNOVA, Inc. (IN) being confident and have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small position  soros

cfd and swap

my trading fees Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) spread and overnight interest swap i have more than  instruments open ALLTEL Corporation (AT) any given time and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) number of them have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive swap if you trade them UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) specific direction i make AutoNation, Inc. (AN) effort to only trade TODCO (THE) direction that earns me interest as i hate holding onto positions that Brinker International, Inc. (EAT) into my profit every day i will only trade TODCO (THE) other direction if TODCO (THE) setup is good enough or if TODCO (THE) overall interest on Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) open positions is positive

trading platform and hardware

i use Mittal Steel Molson Coors Brewing (Company) NV (MT) with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) regular fx broker which gives me Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) wealth of pairs to choose from and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) cfd for anything else Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) interested UNOVA, Inc.

things to improve

taking profit can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) struggle and is often done too early i heavily shorted TODCO (THE) ng rogue wave from TODCO (THE) very top and more recently corn and silver seeing where they went is sometimes hard to stomach especially since they had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive swap and there was no need to close TODCO (THE) entire baskets i always tell myself to leave Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stop ALLTEL Corporation (AT) BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) case TODCO (THE) move continues but i often have this overwhelming feeling of being satisfied and drained from TODCO (THE) trade after holding for weeks that i just Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) fuck Gartner, Inc. (IT) and close TODCO (THE) whole thing to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) done with Gartner, Inc. (IT) and celebrate

TODCO (THE) next one probably applies to more of you i have to watch for getting caught up UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) excitement when things Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) two KeyCorp (KEY) concepts here  trend and momentum lets define them and then Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) into exact entry and exit techniques

trend

put simply Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend is when price is moving UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain direction while price swings Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) agreement with that general move

 uptrend  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) uptrend price swings Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) making higher highs and higher lowers  
 downtrend  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) downtrend price swings Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) making lower lows and lower highs  

TODCO (THE) market doesnt always trend and there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) ugly trends out there this strategy avoids those times UNOVA, Inc. (IN) which TODCO (THE) trend is not UNOVA, Inc. (IN) force to only focus on environments which favor continuation of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) existing trend

trend momentum

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) any trend there is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) cycle of with trend momentum followed by against trend momentum this forms TODCO (THE) pattern of price pushing to fresh extremes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend followed by pullbacks against TODCO (THE) trend

when TODCO (THE) trend reexerts itself you tend to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) explosion of withtrend strength you can identify these points on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) chart by big candles UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) direction of TODCO (THE) overall trend

   Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) downtrend was UNOVA, Inc. (IN) force and these momentum bars marked TODCO (THE) end of pullback and TODCO (THE) continuation of TODCO (THE) trend
   AutoNation, Inc. (AN) uptrend was UNOVA, Inc. (IN) force and these momentum bars marked TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) pullback and TODCO (THE) continuation of TODCO (THE) trend
   Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) downtrend was UNOVA, Inc. (IN) force and these momentum bars marked TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) pullback and continuation of TODCO (THE) trend

and thats really TODCO (THE) conceptual backdrop of TODCO (THE) strategy we find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend that is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pullback and look to enter on fresh momentum UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) direction of TODCO (THE) trend you can train your eyes to spot these patterns within Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple of hours of study its not rocket science

entry criteria

as Perot Systems Corporation (PER) TODCO (THE) entry TODCO (THE) concepts spell out precisely when to look to enter TODCO (THE) market find AutoNation, Inc. (AN) uptrend look for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pullback then buy when you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) withtrend strength

as Perot Systems Corporation (PER) my specific entry criteria i entered with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stop above TODCO (THE) market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) uptrend or below TODCO (THE) market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) downtrend for example if i identified unfolding momentum UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) uptrend i would set AutoNation, Inc. (AN) entry order Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few pips beyond TODCO (THE) high to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) me into TODCO (THE) trade

   buy stop set above TODCO (THE) momentum bar UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) direction of TODCO (THE) trend
   sell stop set below TODCO (THE) momentum bar UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) direction of TODCO (THE) trend

exit initial stop

as you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) by   this strategy gets stopped out Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot

TODCO (THE) reason for this is that i American Greetings Corporation (AM) seeking to capture TODCO (THE) entire unfolding trend by risking only Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small amount to maximize my average win  average loss ratio TODCO (THE) goal here is to make TODCO (THE) rewardrisk ratio such that when i actually captured Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend Gartner, Inc. (IT) would compensate me several times over for losing trades this is very much Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend following strategy designed to deliver outstanding returns when TODCO (THE) market trends and scrape along when Gartner, Inc. (IT) doesnt Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) initial stop loss is very tight Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) as to maximize TODCO (THE) reward Perot Systems Corporation (PER) unit of risk when TODCO (THE) trend cooperates

for AutoNation, Inc. (AN) initial stop loss i set Gartner, Inc. (IT) roughly halfway into TODCO (THE) width of TODCO (THE) momentum bar if TODCO (THE) momentum bar is narrow UNOVA, Inc. (IN) relation to TODCO (THE) recent trading range then i would set TODCO (THE) stop beneath TODCO (THE) momentum bar

   stoploss set somewhere near TODCO (THE) middle of TODCO (THE) candle
   stoploss set somewhere near TODCO (THE) middle of TODCO (THE) candle

exit trailing profit

TODCO (THE) stop loss remains UNOVA, Inc. (IN) place until TODCO (THE) market forms and completes Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pullback UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) trend when Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pullback Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been completed and TODCO (THE) trend continues TODCO (THE) stop loss is moved to TODCO (THE) bottom of TODCO (THE) pullback UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) uptrend or TODCO (THE) top of TODCO (THE) pullback UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) downtrend this process is repeated until TODCO (THE) stop is Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) and you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) taken out of TODCO (THE) trade UNOVA, Inc. (IN) other words you have very high upside potential on each trade with constrained but much more probable risk

   trailing stops Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) set beneath pullbacks when Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pullback completes by pushing into New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) highs this process is repeated until you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) stopped out
   this looks complicated but its really not every time TODCO (THE) market forms Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pullback of  or more bars we wait until price closes beyond TODCO (THE) pullback UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) direction of TODCO (THE) trend and then move our stop to TODCO (THE) bottom of TODCO (THE) pullback

risk management

to protect against losses i risked Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) firm  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) trade if my initial stop was Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) i would trade ALLTEL Corporation (AT) such Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) size that i would lose  of my account balance no exceptions

TODCO (THE) reason here is that with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend following strategy under this riskreward framework you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to lose Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot you need to ensure that you can survive  losses straight with minimal dent to your trading book and you only Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this through risk management

indicators for screening

if you notice on my charts which show actual trades i had TODCO (THE)  period moving average and TODCO (THE)  moving average overlaid on TODCO (THE) chart TODCO (THE) reason for this is that i used TODCO (THE)  period sma as AutoNation, Inc. (AN) scanning indicator and TODCO (THE)  as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) general reference for TODCO (THE) trend

  period sma  i used this indicator to screen for momentum bars example if todays close is TODCO (THE) first close above TODCO (THE) sma and were closing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) top  of TODCO (THE) candle then visually inspect TODCO (THE) chart to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) if were UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend and this is fresh momentum UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) direction of TODCO (THE) trend
  period sma  this indicator gave me Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) quick ataglance metric to give context to my trend analysis if i viewed price as UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend i wanted Gartner, Inc. (IT) to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) above TODCO (THE)  as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) loose confirmation that TODCO (THE) general trend was indeed upwards

my primary focus was on price action find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trend trade fresh withtrend momentum when Gartner, Inc. (IT) appears and then ride TODCO (THE) trend until Gartner, Inc. (IT) ends TODCO (THE) indicators simply served as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) helpful scanning tool and you can trade TODCO (THE) method without them

practical considerations for real trading

practice and trade review

you have to internalize this to actually identify Gartner, Inc. (IT) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) real time if you want to adopt this strategy you Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this through backtesting and verification that your live testing is lining up with your backtest

 backtesting  i spent hundreds of hours dragging charts one bar ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) time and recording trades that i would have taken if Gartner, Inc. (IT) were realtime on AutoNation, Inc. (AN) ongoing basis i would backtest  backtrade TODCO (THE) past decade of data for every instrument i traded this practically meant that i was spending  of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and  of my time actually trading if you havent quite figured out trading id suggest you put UNOVA, Inc. (IN) serious effort into TODCO (THE) area of backtest and intentional practice
 trade review  on AutoNation, Inc. (AN) ongoing basis i would Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) complete review of Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of my trades to figure out how to sharpen my edge and to verify that i was perfectly trading my plan  no matter your strategy i believe trade review is crucial how will you know if youre making mistakes if youre not reviewing what youve done how will you know if you can Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) better if youre not carefully questioning each and every trade to try and Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) better this sheet Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) several more columns and was just one iteration of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) ongoing review process

if this seems like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of work thats TODCO (THE) point you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) competing against some of TODCO (THE) brightest minds UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) world why would TODCO (THE) market allow trading to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) as easy as opening AutoNation, Inc. (AN) app on your way to TODCO (THE) beach to profitability trade you really need to invest heavily UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  verifying that what youre doing Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) history of making money and  verifying that youre actually executing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) perfect alignment with your testing as well as looking for ways to improve performance youll always Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) lucky dude flaunting his returns but for TODCO (THE) vast majority of professional traders this is just scratching TODCO (THE) surface of TODCO (THE) types of analysis you need to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) to monitor and improve your discretionary trading edge

psychology

theres no getting around Gartner, Inc. (IT) trading is psychologically difficult for many people my two silver bullets Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) desire to succeed

 you must have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge first off Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) you have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge unless you have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) either Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) demonstrated track record of making money or Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) backtest of your exact method showing that Gartner, Inc. (IT) makes money then youll probably have mental angst even with my trades resting on hundreds of hours of study and backtesting demonstrating TODCO (THE) validity of my method Gartner, Inc. (IT) was still difficult to pull TODCO (THE) trigger and take TODCO (THE) next trade ALLTEL Corporation (AT) times knowing i had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) demonstrated edge is what gave me TODCO (THE) confidence to overcome mental angst and put on TODCO (THE) next trade
 you must have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) desire to succeed and second bullet is this Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) you want to succeed if you have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) demonstrated edge and have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) rock solid conviction and drive to succeed then Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of psychological issues take care of themselves i remember TODCO (THE) pain of sitting UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) prolonged drawdown after losing several trades UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) row Gartner, Inc. (IT) was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) defining moment for me Gartner, Inc. (IT) is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) unique pain that words cant quite capture UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) depths of TODCO (THE) pain of losing trade after trade and UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) process worrying if id lose my job i reminded myself that  i have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge and  i really want to succeed ALLTEL Corporation (AT) this Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i picked myself back up and took TODCO (THE) next trade and over TODCO (THE) next few months i delivered some of my strongest returns and broke into New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) equity highs

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion people Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) TODCO (THE) cart before TODCO (THE) horse UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) territory of psychology trading gurus seem to suggest that if you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) your mindset aligned money will just flow into your account thats simply not TODCO (THE) case if TODCO (THE) places UNOVA, Inc. (IN) which you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) buying and selling have zero demonstrated ability to actually make money step  Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) demonstrated edge step  ensure youre able to act on that edge through proper psychology

AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge

TODCO (THE) expected value equation is TODCO (THE) foundation of trading put simply

 expected value  win percentage USX Corporation (X) average win size  loss percentage  average loss size

if that equation is negative you dont have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge if its positive you have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge if you play around with TODCO (THE) math youll Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that win ratio or average win  loss size UNOVA, Inc. (IN) isolation Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) irrelevant you can have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) high win ratio with large losers or Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) win ratio with large winners and have TODCO (THE) exact same mathematical edge TODCO (THE) only thing youre varying is TODCO (THE) distribution of your returns

my strategy detailed above is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive skew strategy lots of small losses and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few very large wins you can adapt Gartner, Inc. (IT) by either larger stops or adding targets to change your distribution of returns TODCO (THE) underlying edge is real markets trend and ALLTEL Corporation (AT) certain points you can participate UNOVA, Inc. (IN) them to outperform TODCO (THE) baseline drift of TODCO (THE) market how you size your targets and stops shapes TODCO (THE) ultimate distribution of returns you will receive as you capture this edge

conclusion

take Gartner, Inc. (IT) or leave Gartner, Inc. (IT) theres Agilent Technologies, Inc.

observations

anecdotally Gartner, Inc. (IT) seems that TODCO (THE) longer that these went TODCO (THE) more difficult that they were or ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least TODCO (THE) more scared i got scalp  was notorious i was down by  ALLTEL Corporation (AT) one point but held on and pulled TODCO (THE) trade out with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) win one of TODCO (THE) others i forget which saw me down about  but i eventually Westwood One, Inc. (WON) that one too

TODCO (THE) difference between winning and losing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) scalp can come down to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) split second Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) even if someone were sitting next to me and trying to mimic my every move they might have had losses theres also Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain blind aspect to Gartner, Inc. (IT) i was buying Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call contract using Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) limit order always below TODCO (THE) bid price never TODCO (THE) midpoint and selling ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) market price because TODCO (THE) trades generally happened too quickly to even think about using Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sell limit order this only makes sense to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) highly liquid stock with lots of options volume

during one of TODCO (THE) days TODCO (THE) underlying stock was UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) downtrend i made money by using rsi and macd using Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very short holding time and relying on microbursts of momentum

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) general my success was made possible by TODCO (THE) fact that TODCO (THE) stock i chose was trading UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very very very narrow range during TODCO (THE) very brief intervals UNOVA, Inc. (IN) which i held Gartner, Inc. (IT) and Gartner, Inc. (IT) seemed to oscillate above and below TODCO (THE) mean price UNOVA, Inc. (IN) that interval like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sine wave thus i could use TODCO (THE) macd as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pretty reliable signal for buying and selling

psychologically this took Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of energy and focus monday trading lasted one hour and eight minutes tuesday lasted one hour eleven minutes and thirtyseven seconds wednesday lasted nineteen minutes and twentythree seconds on monday and tuesday i just couldnt handle any more trading even though i Westwood One, Inc. (WON) every trade on wednesday Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) day that i hadnt wanted to trade but snuck UNOVA, Inc. (IN) those two trades i didnt want to push my luck i did Gartner, Inc. (IT) to top things off i really hate options scalping as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strategy because its Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) intense but if you need cash right this minute its probably your best bet my favorite strategy on TODCO (THE) other hand is shorting put options with AutoNation, Inc. (AN) expiration date several months out

i strongly advise against trying something like this on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) thursday and you absolutely cant Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) friday due to theta decay and gamma and vega or youll lose your shirt although iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) never held Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) scalp overnight iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) considered TODCO (THE) possibility of buying on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) monday and waiting possibly three more days if thats what Gartner, Inc. (IT) took for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) substantial gain UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this way with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bunch of days to rely upon you might give yourself multiple opportunities to win should one day not prove favorable i prefer AutoNation, Inc. (AN) intraday scalp though because you never know what could happen UNOVA, Inc. (IN) afterhours trading

i honestly dont know if winning Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) sixteen of TODCO (THE) trades consecutively was almost entirely dumb luck or hardly any latent skill but Gartner, Inc. (IT) seems unlikely from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) statistical perspective that Gartner, Inc. (IT) was entirely dumb luck i dont plan on trying this again anytime soon either way i like to design winning options plays very carefully and take lots of time executing them for slow easy wins Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) was interesting to try to emulate TODCO (THE) scalpers everything considered Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) just grateful for TODCO (THE) unexpected success using Agilent Technologies, Inc.

however there will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) threshold to admit him to TODCO (THE) hospital because Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.

is this Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) coincidence or AutoNation, Inc. (AN) accident for TODCO (THE) above change UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) stock market

now one question whether TODCO (THE) movement UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) stock market is driven by events or TODCO (THE) high and Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) points ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) previous time point cycle therefore chinas stock market proceeds UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc.

there is also Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) cycle for real estate although economists Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) over TODCO (THE) world hold different opinions towards TODCO (THE) research of TODCO (THE) real estate market but they serve TODCO (THE) same effect i will state TODCO (THE) opinions of TODCO (THE) following economists for your reference

michael hoyt TODCO (THE) author of one hundred years of land values UNOVA, Inc. (IN) chicago studied TODCO (THE) price of real estate UNOVA, Inc. (IN) chicago UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) time period of  years since there were only dozens of wooden houses and Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) found that its price cycles about every  years

edward Ryder System, Inc. (R) deway known as TODCO (THE) father of cycle analysis believed that each real estate cycle lasts for about  years

fred harrison Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) british economist studying TODCO (THE) real estate market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) britain and united states UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) past plus years found that TODCO (THE) housing price cycled about every  years

simon smith kuznets believed that TODCO (THE) building cycle is  to  years

Gartner, Inc. (IT) is coincidentally acknowledged that TODCO (THE) real estate market cycles every  to  years starting from  Gartner, Inc. (IT) is generally believed that TODCO (THE) real estate market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) hong kong Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) gone through three major cycles TODCO (THE) first cycle from  to  TODCO (THE) second one from  to  and TODCO (THE) third one from  to now TODCO (THE) housing price often goes up or down along with TODCO (THE) change of both internal and external elements

i have mentioned TODCO (THE) hong kong real estate market cycle UNOVA, Inc. (IN) different situations Gartner, Inc. (IT) is not difficult to draw Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) conclusion from TODCO (THE) cycle of hong kongs real estate market that TODCO (THE) cycle works every Swiss Exchange (SIX) years since  great changes occur every Swiss Exchange (SIX) years including    and  with ganns  segmentation method we can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) that three years constitute Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) secondary cycle namely UNOVA, Inc. (IN)    and 

TODCO (THE) change of TODCO (THE) real estate market can also BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) concluded with TODCO (THE) year cycle which Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) worked since  undoubtedly TODCO (THE) real estate market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) hong kong goes up after experiencing TODCO (THE) lowest point UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  predicably that TODCO (THE) year of  is likely to witness TODCO (THE) completion of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) year cycle stepping back again TODCO (THE) rise of TODCO (THE) real estate market UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) explained with TODCO (THE) year cycle mentioned above since TODCO (THE) signing of TODCO (THE) sinobritish joint declaration UNOVA, Inc. (IN) 

Gartner, Inc. (IT) is likely that TODCO (THE) upsurge of hong kongs real estate market will end UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  and then we should turn to TODCO (THE) turning point that may appear from  to 

TODCO (THE) economic cycle of us stocks Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very obvious year cycle

UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  TODCO (THE) united states experienced Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) credit crunch UNOVA, Inc. (IN) august of TODCO (THE) same year TODCO (THE) us treasury market suffered Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) severe liquidity crisis

UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  seven years later TODCO (THE) world suffered TODCO (THE) first oil crisis with stock market and economic problems and TODCO (THE) first stagflation

seven years later UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  wall street forced TODCO (THE) hunt brothers to stop hoarding silver  which helped some banks and securities firms to avoid bankruptcy

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) october  TODCO (THE) Dow Chemical Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (DOW) fell  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) one day on black monday

seven years later UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  TODCO (THE) fed raised interest rates Swiss Exchange (SIX) times UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) row and interest rates rose sharply from  to  resulting UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) most famous bond massacre UNOVA, Inc. (IN) history

seven years later UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  TODCO (THE) black swan event of  triggered Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) severe setback UNOVA, Inc.

(IN) one week

TODCO (THE) year cycle came to  TODCO (THE) financial tsunami hong kong stocks and us stocks plunged

UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  hong kong stocks and us stocks crash



i would predict that UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  there may BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) significant pullback UNOVA, Inc. (IN) us stocks",0,too long; didn'ALLTEL Corporation (AT)&T Inc. (T) read this year we crash,"TODCO (THE) economic cycle of us stocks Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very obvious year cycle

lots of confirmation bias here shoehorning things into this year cycle yes most years something bad happens UNOVA, Inc. (IN) stocks ALLTEL Corporation (AT) some point you seem to suggest that TODCO (THE)  terrorist attack was predicted by this year cycle Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) you think TODCO (THE) hijackers wanted to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  but held off until  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) would fit this timeline

if were looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) exogenous events how does TODCO (THE) worst day period for TODCO (THE) sp since TODCO (THE) great depression fit into this narrative no mention of covid crash of march  

why Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) you bringing TODCO (THE) hunt brothers silver squeeze into this i thought we were talking about stocks couldnt find anything else that happened UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  because TODCO (THE) sp  was up  UNOVA, Inc. (IN)   ill take that

my New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) theory is that now Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) even years have significant pullbacks Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) buy puts UNOVA, Inc. (IN) even years

stock market crash,options,I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,"we have Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) heard Gartner, Inc. (IT)  time UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market beats timing TODCO (THE) market

ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) same time we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) to some extent guilty of trying to time TODCO (THE) market TODCO (THE) market always seems to break some New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) alltime high records Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) we wait for TODCO (THE) inevitable crashpullback to invest its high time we put both strategies to test basically what i wanted to analyze was

whether waiting for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crash to invest is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) better investment strategy than staying invested

analysis

for this lets take someone who started investing approximately  decades back  to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) exact i created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand TODCO (THE) difference UNOVA, Inc. (IN) returns if you

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) invested ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b was extremely unlucky and just invested ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) peak every year

Citigroup, Inc. (C) did not care about timing TODCO (THE) market and invested ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) random date every year

Dominion Resources, Inc. (D) just hoarded his cash and waited for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) market crash to invest   

for analysis simplicity lets assume that you were on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) conservative side never picked individual stocks and always made your investments to sp  for investment amount consider that you started with investing Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  and increased your investments by  for every subsequent year Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) you made Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) total investment of Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) over TODCO (THE) last  years  

results



TODCO (THE) analysis did throw up some interesting results theres Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot to unpack here and lets break Gartner, Inc. (IT) down by each segment

TODCO (THE) most important insight is that its virtually impossible to lose money over TODCO (THE) long term UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market  even if you were TODCO (THE) unluckiest person and invested exactly ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) very top each year you will still end up having Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  return on your invested amount

ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) opposite end of TODCO (THE) spectrum if you were somehow TODCO (THE) luckiest person and invested only ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) lowest point every year you would have made Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) cool  more than someone who invested only ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) top given both TODCO (THE) hypothetical scenarios Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) extreme cases lets consider some more realistic scenarios      

if you did not care about timing TODCO (THE) market and invested Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fixed amount each monthyear you would still make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) shade over  on your investments

out of Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) above scenarios you would have made TODCO (THE) most amount of money Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) whopping  return if you invested only during major crashes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this type of investing you would not invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crash

while this seems like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good idea UNOVA, Inc. (IN) theory its extremely difficult to execute properly UNOVA, Inc. (IN) real life TODCO (THE) main limitations to investing during Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crash strategy Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE)

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) TODCO (THE) current returns Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) calculated by investing ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) very bottom of TODCO (THE) crashes its very difficult to identify TODCO (THE) bottom of TODCO (THE) crash while Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crash is happening you can end up investing midway through TODCO (THE) crash and given that you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) investing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) significant chunk of capital you saved up Gartner, Inc. (IT) can end up wiping out your portfolio

b identifying Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crash itself is very hard



as we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) from TODCO (THE) above chart TODCO (THE) years that we consider were great for TODCO (THE) market UNOVA, Inc. (IN) hindsight still had significant drops within TODCO (THE) same year Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) even when TODCO (THE) market is down  Gartner, Inc. (IT) becomes extremely difficult to know whether its going into Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) deeper crash or whether its going to bounce back up

conclusion

while TODCO (THE) analysis did prove that waiting for TODCO (THE) crash is theoretically TODCO (THE) best strategy returnswise practically its very difficult to execute Gartner, Inc. (IT)

for eg even if you predicted TODCO (THE)  coronavirus crash correctly where would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) your entry point TODCO (THE) market was down  by Marriot International (MAR) th another  by Marriot International (MAR) th and then another  by march th for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) total of  if you did not Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) absolute bottom you would have lost Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from TODCO (THE) previous runup   

Gartner, Inc. (IT) is extremely enticing to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) guy who called TODCO (THE) crash correctly and even if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) right only getting UNOVA, Inc. (IN) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) absolute bottom would only give you TODCO (THE) best returns adding to this UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) last  years  of TODCO (THE) best days UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market happened within  days of TODCO (THE) worst ones  if you miss just any of those days waiting for AutoNation, Inc. (AN) entry point your returns would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested

if you think you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) select few who have TODCO (THE) skills to identify Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) crash and TODCO (THE) temperament to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) crash through to invest ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) very bottom you will make AutoNation, Inc. (AN) absolute killing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market for TODCO (THE) rest of us continuous investment regardless of TODCO (THE) market trends seems to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) better choice

options,options,The Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitability (The reasons selling option premium makes or loses money),"heres what makes option selling profitable UNOVA, Inc. (IN) detail and how to increase your returns selling them

this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long post Gartner, Inc. (IT) helps you understand options Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit better and make some profitable decisions UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) future

i try to make theta and options easier to understand by relating Gartner, Inc. (IT) to real estate and moving one step ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) time

if you have questions leave Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) comment ill try to respond to everyone

lets dive into TODCO (THE) world of theta and options trading

  theta is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) feature of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option plain and simple

imagine showing someone Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) house and saying to them its  bedrooms  washrooms good neighbourhood and TODCO (THE) rent is Altria Group (MO)

each thing you listed UNOVA, Inc. (IN) that sentence is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) feature of TODCO (THE) house you wouldnt Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) that TODCO (THE) house is good or bad because bedroom or because rent etc its TODCO (THE) over Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) view with Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) things considered

similarly theta gamma vega delta etc these Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) just features of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option inherently they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not good or bad they just tell you about TODCO (THE) option you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT)

  think of theta as rent

if options were Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) house theta would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) rent think about Gartner, Inc. (IT) like this someone pays rent to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) access to TODCO (THE) house

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) options space someone pays theta for access to other features of TODCO (THE) option

can you guess what they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) paying for access to

  one mans theta is another mans gamma

if you guessed gamma you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) correct traders Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) theta to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) access to gamma

TODCO (THE) easy way to think about gamma is that its your sensitivity to big moves if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock moves like crazy TODCO (THE) option buyer makes some bank right Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) why on earth would anyone sell options

  TODCO (THE) amount of theta is directly correlated with TODCO (THE) gamma risk

going back to our house example if you wanted to buy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big penthouse UNOVA, Inc. (IN) downtown New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) york TODCO (THE) rent is probably pretty high its because you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) access to some awesome shit if you Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) Gartner, Inc. (IT) Gartner, Inc. (IT) wouldnt make sense for TODCO (THE) rent to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Altria Group (MO) no one would rent Gartner, Inc. (IT) out TODCO (THE) rent is correlated with TODCO (THE) house you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) exposure to

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) options space if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of gamma risk aka TODCO (THE) risk of big move TODCO (THE) theta on TODCO (THE) option is higher too this is because if Gartner, Inc. (IT) were not proportionately higher no one would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) seller and there would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) no market

now heres TODCO (THE) KeyCorp (KEY) if gamma and theta were perfectly even and markets were totally efficient TODCO (THE) expected value would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  you wouldnt make money being Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) buyer or seller UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this world who wouldnt want break even exposure to big moves its basically Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) free hedge

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) theres this little thing called variance risk premium

  option sellers Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small premium for being on TODCO (THE) short side of convexity

TODCO (THE) variance risk premium is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small edge for TODCO (THE) option seller that they Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) for holding TODCO (THE) risk of big moves

because of this on average selling options is profitable UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) long run you will have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of small winners and TODCO (THE) occasional big loser this is what we call Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short vol strategy

you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) risk premium on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of stocks AutoNation, Inc. (AN) easy way to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Gartner, Inc. (IT) is to plot TODCO (THE) implied volatility for  day options over TODCO (THE) realized volatility for  day period you should Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that on average TODCO (THE) implied move what TODCO (THE) options Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) will happen is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit higher than what actually does this is TODCO (THE) premium

and then you will Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) periods where TODCO (THE) big gamma move happens and TODCO (THE) rv goes higher than TODCO (THE) iv this is why TODCO (THE) premium exists

example



xb

green line  iv blue line  rv this is on SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) how most of TODCO (THE) time iv  rv sometimes TODCO (THE) rv shoots up though that is TODCO (THE) risk we take when selling why we Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) paid Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) premium

but heres TODCO (THE) thing how much can we really expect to make here

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) long run about  Perot Systems Corporation (PER) year boo

i want more you want more fuck   year Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) how Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) we Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT)

  buy cheap things sell expensive things

lets go back to our house example  more time imagine we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) evaluating Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) property UNOVA, Inc. (IN) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) york city Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sudden Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) huge amount of demand comes into TODCO (THE) market there is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) shortage of houses for Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) renters Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) rent keeps increasing you look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) your property  beds nice view fair rent is probably  Altria Group (MO) but you look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) market and people Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) offering Altria Group (MO) for your property

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this case by renting out your property you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) making AutoNation, Inc. (AN) inflated premium or Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) rent premium higher than what you should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) making given TODCO (THE) asset you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) giving someone access to

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options we can find stocks where TODCO (THE) theta is higher than Gartner, Inc. (IT) should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) given TODCO (THE) gamma we give someone exposure to

think about some of these meme stocks as example Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many buyers Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) few sellers who wants that risk right

well this is perhaps opportunity

if we can come into TODCO (THE) market and put Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fair value on TODCO (THE) gamma we can find times where we can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) overcompensated with theta

there is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) simple formula for understanding this

if implied volatility is higher than what you think realized volatility will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) sell

even more simply put if option more expensive than how much stock move sell

TODCO (THE) hard part is learning to price volatility  options ill cover TODCO (THE) basics UNOVA, Inc. (IN) another post if this one does well

  heres AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example of how i analyzeprice gamma and theta

imagine we divided TODCO (THE) iv by TODCO (THE) rv we would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) how much higher or lower TODCO (THE) iv is compared to TODCO (THE) rv

example if ivrv   then TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) option is USX Corporation (X) higher than TODCO (THE) value TODCO (THE) buyer is actually getting easy way to think about Gartner, Inc. (IT)

by plotting TODCO (THE) ivrv ratio historically we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) how much of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) premium their typically is and how bad Gartner, Inc. (IT) gets when TODCO (THE) gamma move is big

example



typically TODCO (THE) ivrv ratio for  DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) options is positive on SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) but we Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) have periods of pain where Gartner, Inc. (IT) goes lower and that erases Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of gains

 conclusion

theta is not free money its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) characteristic of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option understanding Gartner, Inc. (IT) is important but really its our ability to price risk that makes us money as traders TODCO (THE) better we Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) pricing risk TODCO (THE) truly juicier premiums we can find

if this post is well received by TODCO (THE) community ill gladly Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) follow up

happy trading everyone",1612,"theta is not free money theta is free money  


except when Gartner, Inc. (IT) isnt","i remember when i first started buying options barely broke even even when TODCO (THE) great ones USX Corporation (X) because Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many of them expire worthless

decided to take TODCO (THE) other side of TODCO (THE) trade and sell options now i make quite Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of consistent gains as income and Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) assigned here and there

when i Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) assigned i just sell ccs to generate more income or Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Gartner, Inc. (IT) called away

either way its better than just aimlessly buying calls and burning cash ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least when i literally burn cash i can keep myself warm","i think you credit theta too much and you forget to speak TODCO (THE) role vega is playing UNOVA, Inc.

theres AutoNation, Inc. (AN) insightful piece on  that identifies there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly

first way is retail investors not holding TODCO (THE) line and panic selling thereby driving TODCO (THE) price down further releasing into TODCO (THE) market more of TODCO (THE) float and enabling shorts to coverbuy back shares ALLTEL Corporation (AT) progressively lower levels

(IN) other words could indicate that TODCO (THE) reddit army is headed for TODCO (THE) hills and TODCO (THE) longs were selling early giving TODCO (THE) shorts Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) means to cover as TODCO (THE) longs got out important to note that if TODCO (THE) long holders of Gamestop Corporation (GME) shares did not break ranks and sell ENEL S.p.Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A). (EN) masse Gartner, Inc. (IT) would have been impossible for TODCO (THE) share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) same time because without Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) critical mass of longside holders selling into TODCO (THE) market TODCO (THE) hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered bought back their short positions



however TODCO (THE) other scenario where this can occur is TODCO (THE) hedge fund short interest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Gamestop Corporation (GME) didnt really dissipate but instead they played Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trick to make Gartner, Inc. (IT) seem like Gartner, Inc. (IT) did demoralizing TODCO (THE) retail side and further breaking TODCO (THE) squeeze



to now quote verbatim from tradesmithdaily

TODCO (THE) way TODCO (THE) hedge funds could have done this  made Gartner, Inc. (IT) appear as if they covered their shorts even when they really didnt  involves trickery UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) options market

TODCO (THE) tactics involved Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) secret UNOVA, Inc. (IN) fact TODCO (THE) securities and exchange commission sec knows Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) about such tactics and published Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) risk alert memo on TODCO (THE) topic UNOVA, Inc. (IN) august 

TODCO (THE) sec memo is titled strengthening practices for preventing and detecting illegal options trading used to reset Regency Centers Corporation (REG) Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. (SHO) closeout obligations you can 

TODCO (THE) memo contains Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) dozen pages of highly technical language but heres Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) quick rundown

 if short sellers Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) facing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) squeeze because shares Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) hard to buy or scrutiny for holding AutoNation, Inc. (AN) illegal short position they can create AutoNation, Inc. (AN) appearance of having closed their short position through TODCO (THE) use of deceptive options trades
 Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hedge fund that is short Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock can write call options on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock  meaning they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) now short TODCO (THE) call options having sold TODCO (THE) call options to someone else typically Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) market maker  and simultaneously buy shares against TODCO (THE) call options
 TODCO (THE) shares bought against TODCO (THE) call options could BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) synthetic longs  meaning they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) not part of TODCO (THE) original share float of TODCO (THE) stock  as sold to TODCO (THE) hedge fund by TODCO (THE) market maker that takes TODCO (THE) other side of TODCO (THE) options trade
 this works because if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) market maker buys options from AutoNation, Inc. (AN) options writer TODCO (THE) market maker Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) legal privileges to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) version of naked shorting as part of their hedging function this is necessary under TODCO (THE) current rules and TODCO (THE) current system for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades
 as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) result of TODCO (THE) above transaction TODCO (THE) hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against TODCO (THE) calls Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) synthetic share is one that Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long on one side and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short on TODCO (THE) other but wasnt part of TODCO (THE) original float TODCO (THE) synthetic long shares Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) other side of TODCO (THE) naked shorts legally initiated by TODCO (THE) market maker Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) market maker can hedge
 TODCO (THE) hedge fund that bought TODCO (THE) shares can now report that they have bought back their short position Viacom, Inc. (VIA) buying long shares  except they actually havent TODCO (THE) synthetic shares they bought Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) canceled out against TODCO (THE) short call positions they initiated Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) necessity of TODCO (THE) maneuver by way of TODCO (THE) market makers hedging of TODCO (THE) call position they bought from TODCO (THE) hedge fund

Gartner, Inc. (IT) gets very complicated very Fastenal Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (FAST)

but TODCO (THE) gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make Gartner, Inc. (IT) look like theyve covered their shorts  even if they havent truly covered and cant for lack of available float  by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to AutoNation, Inc. (AN) interplay of reporting rule delays market maker naked shorting exceptions and legal practices of synthetic share creation New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) longs and shorts made from thin air relating to marketmaking

below is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) section of TODCO (THE) sec memo from page  that gets to TODCO (THE) heart of Gartner, Inc. (IT)

trader Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) may enter Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) buywrite transaction consisting of selling deepinthemoney calls and buying shares of stock against TODCO (THE) call sale by doing Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) trader Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) appears to have purchased shares to meet TODCO (THE) brokerdealers closeout obligation for TODCO (THE) fail to deliver that resulted from TODCO (THE) reverse conversion UNOVA, Inc. (IN) practice however TODCO (THE) circumstances suggest that trader Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) no intention of delivering shares and is instead reestablishing or extending Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fail position



UNOVA, Inc. (IN) short no pun intended these tricks help hedge funds maintain short positions that legally speaking they werent supposed to have because TODCO (THE) shares were never properly located which triggers alarm bells when we consider TODCO (THE) extraordinarily high amount of ftidsfailed to deliver shares  and michael burrys now deleted tweet viewable here  about how when Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) called back shares Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) lent out brokers took weeks to actually find them with TODCO (THE) implication they could not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) located

these factors lend credence to TODCO (THE) idea that shorts werent really covered but were given TODCO (THE) impression of being covered with trickery using options UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to cover short positions that they shouldnt have had to begin with because shares were never properly located

separately but potentially related s released updated short numbers last sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from  to  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) day later on friday to  on sunday while markets were closed therefore UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my estimation using TODCO (THE) same data set that calculated  which many found to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) suspicious later Gartner, Inc. (IT) was found that this New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) number was calculated using TODCO (THE) same data set that yielded  short interest percentage but with TODCO (THE) significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into TODCO (THE) short float equation which is against standard practice

for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) more detailed breakdown Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) user here pasted Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good analysis of how those numbers were reached 



excerpt

TODCO (THE) real short  according to ss data is  however their  figure is technically not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lie but extremely misleading i will explain everything

here is what they didsources s head

s head is redefining share float to include shares that dont exist UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) shorted  of float is lower

Gartner, Inc. (IT) reduces TODCO (THE) traditional Siemens AGCO Corporation (AG) (SI)  float instead of shares shortedfloat our calc is shares shorted float  shares shorted

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) by this definition if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock is shorted  of existing shares total banana count borrowed and resold USX Corporation (X) and total shares is  short  is calculated like this shorts   shares   longs whose shares Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) borrowed  that is TODCO (THE) normal way we define short  would Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) its  shorted ss way says 

knowing this formula we can work back to what s would have said TODCO (THE) short  of float was using TODCO (THE) normal definition of short  of float short of float means for Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) existing shares  shorts or ont Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) other side of TODCO (THE) trade longs whose shares were borrowed away to short is  as much as existing shares meaning portion of shares short by TODCO (THE) normal definition  of existing bananas borrowed is   

that is ss data is telling them that after friday trading Gamestop Corporation (GME) is still  short



many have pointed out this could BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) manipulation on ss part its interesting to note that as late as TODCO (THE) jan th ihor from s stated most Gamestop Corporation (GME) shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadnt moved much ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL)  initially on TODCO (THE) th Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) claimed short interest float to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)   TODCO (THE) next day Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) claimed short interest to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)   of float  days later on sunday s released Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) report on TODCO (THE) calculated short interest to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted but found this  which was confusing to many as this was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big discrepancy UNOVA, Inc. (IN) short percentage UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short time Gartner, Inc. (IT) turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into TODCO (THE) equation which is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) practice that is not standard thereby yielding Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lower short interest percentage of  which TODCO (THE) media then bandied around before and during market open on monday whether this involved collusion to harm TODCO (THE) retail investor i cannot conclusively Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) as i dont have TODCO (THE) evidence to conclusively make that claim but definitely something to consider along with Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) other data points

with TODCO (THE) possibility of synthetic long shares being used UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fraudulent way if you care about how this could play out if we force TODCO (THE) issue i would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment  and call or email gamestop investor relations and ask them to call AutoNation, Inc. (AN) emergency share holder meeting to save TODCO (THE) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) from bankruptcy as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) synthetic stock and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating UNOVA, Inc. (IN) fraudulent activity

(ARE) related to this subject that i recommend you check out",3065,"very insightful and informative this is TODCO (THE) kind of calm and rational thinking that we should Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) attention to seeing TODCO (THE) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) short  on TODCO (THE) th will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) interesting","unfortunately TODCO (THE) sec is made up of not only Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) barely scraping by budget but also some former wallstreet players like goldman sachs exec alan cohen hired as senior policy advisor to TODCO (THE) sec chairman UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  i cant imagine they would hire people without experience UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) field they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) supposed to regulate its also odd how Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many of these sec memos coming to light describe TODCO (THE) exact actions and circumstances that have been happening for years which makes me think some or Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of them Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) written from personal experience

much like TODCO (THE) jim cramer interview from mid s on TODCO (THE) streettv found on youtube they spell out what can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) done regardless of legality TODCO (THE) only law Gartner, Inc. (IT) seems is how much money does Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain action Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) 

this isnt over yet more things will become clear once TODCO (THE) investigations and testimonies begin i just hope there is finally some justice served towards TODCO (THE) people that wrecked our economy toyed with our lives and UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) end got rewarded for Gartner, Inc. (IT)",this is incredibly insightful thanks for Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) time you put into this  if iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned anything from TODCO (THE) last couple weeks its that theres some insanely shady things going down across TODCO (THE) board and theres some deep seeded collusion working against us retailers

i was reading that people werent getting exercised and Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) its just total bad luck that Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) my contracts got exercised my thinking was TODCO (THE) float is Millipore Corporation (MIL) but with TODCO (THE) number of contracts that were sold how did they Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) much stock Gartner, Inc.

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been trading stocks for  years and options for  i have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fulltime job and just Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this on TODCO (THE) side but iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen and tried Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of stuff

one of my favorite trading strategies involves selling spx put credit spreads around  delta  otm  days to expiration crazy right yeah sounds like Gartner, Inc. (IT) but bear with me while i lay out TODCO (THE) nittygritty i like TODCO (THE) strategy Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) much that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) decided to finally lay Gartner, Inc. (IT) out UNOVA, Inc. (IN) full detail for others to learn

my inspiration for this started after reading and following karstens passive income through option writing from  Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) lays out his reasoning and thought process way better than i ever could Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) if you like what you Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) here go check out his stuff as well for more research and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) twist on what Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) doing

what i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO)

every monday wednesday  friday i sell open New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) put credit spreads on spx that expire ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) closest expiration Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) monday i sell spx spreads that expire wednesday wednesday i sell spreads that expire friday friday i sell spreads that expire monday i hold these Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) way to expiration and then open Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) position with TODCO (THE) next expiration  of TODCO (THE) time these expire worthless and i collect full premium TODCO (THE) other  of TODCO (THE) time i suffer Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small or large loss over TODCO (THE) long run TODCO (THE) expected return blows TODCO (THE) market out of TODCO (THE) waterwhich leads me to

expected return

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been running this since may  and American Greetings Corporation (AM) averaging something around  apy based on max risk for TODCO (THE) spread its absurd dont believe me my full trade log is published  and i update Gartner, Inc. (IT) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) realtime yes thats my website no Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) not selling any kind of productservice there more on that later

risk  drawdown

this massive positive return doesnt come without Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) of course and if something sounds too good to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) true Gartner, Inc. (IT) usually is and TODCO (THE) Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) here is that yeah while annual return is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ridiculous  max drawdown can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  or more whaaaaat yeah thats right while these spreads expire worthless  of TODCO (THE) time TODCO (THE) other  can result UNOVA, Inc. (IN) huge losses these losses can accumulate up to  or more depending on TODCO (THE) environment

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) guaranteed way to blow up your account right well Gartner, Inc. (IT) is if you allocate too much capital to Gartner, Inc. (IT) but if you keep your allocation small which i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) then Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  drawdown for this one strategy will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) small fraction of your overall portfolio i personally only allocate about  of my total portfolio to this what that means is that ifwhen this trading plan suffers Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  loss that only represents  drawdown for my portfolio and i can tap into my other investments to replenish this trading plan

these massive losses Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) happen but they dont last long i ran this very strategy through covid when vix moved from  to  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) month and my max drawdown was only about  i reloaded from my other investments and this put selling strategy recovered and turned green UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  before TODCO (THE) market itself didafter i went down 

pennies meet steamroller right

yeah this is pretty close to TODCO (THE) definition of picking up pennies UNOVA, Inc. (IN) front of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) steamroller theres nothing inherently wrong with that if

 TODCO (THE) pennies that you collect add up to more than what TODCO (THE) steamroller takes away
 you limit allocation Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) that when TODCO (THE) steamroller hits you Gartner, Inc. (IT) doesnt destroy you

  i collect around  premium Perot Systems Corporation (PER) position compared to max risk spread width  of TODCO (THE) time they expire worthless Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i keep TODCO (THE) full  TODCO (THE) other  of TODCO (THE) time i suffer what is usually Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) large loss averaging around  Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) TODCO (THE) math here    is  gain on TODCO (THE) wins    is  loss on TODCO (THE) losers    makes for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very positive expected returnso that takes care of  TODCO (THE) pennies i collect far outweigh TODCO (THE) steamroller when Gartner, Inc. (IT) hits me

  i only allocate  of my overall portfolio to this when TODCO (THE) steamroller hits me and results UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  loss for TODCO (THE) strategy Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) not wiped out thats only  drawdown on my account which is easy to recover from this is what Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many people miss when talking about TODCO (THE) ole steamroller if you just keep allocation UNOVA, Inc. (IN) check its okay to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) steamroller every now and then

trade process  timing  strike selection

TODCO (THE) process here is simple every mwf afternoon open Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) set of put spreads expiring ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) next expiration mondays position expires wednesday wednesdays position expires friday fridays position expires monday my short strike is around  delta my long strike is  points below that this results UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short strike around  otm UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) iv environments and  otm UNOVA, Inc. (IN) high iv environments TODCO (THE) long strike will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)  otm again depending on iv itll BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) farther out as vix rises

you only suffer max loss if TODCO (THE) sp drops  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) day or two out of absolutely nowhere vix   or if sp drops  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) day or two after freefall Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) already started UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  months and with vix rocketing to  during that timeframe not once Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) one of my spreads even seen max lossim sure itll happen ALLTEL Corporation (AT) some point but if didnt happen UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) curious to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) when Gartner, Inc. (IT) would happen

why spx

  expirations available every week mondaywednesdayfriday
 highly liquid
 cashsettled no underlying given to me on assignment
 Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) trading fees for me personally  your mileage may vary
 beneficial tax treatment  longterm based on irs  contract straddles
 less paperwork to FileNet Corporation (FILE) for taxes futures and index options aggregate together on irs tax forms eliminating  line items from this trading strategy UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) year

spx is awesome

alternatives to spx

some of you may not have access to spx options or your account isnt large enough to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) handle spx options they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) huge Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) single contract represents Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) notional TODCO (THE) cashsettlement and riskdefined trades help diminish TODCO (THE) impact of size but its still Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of underlying to carry around es futures Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) half TODCO (THE) size and should work as well just BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) sure you understand fees assignment and liquidity first SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) can also work and is even smaller than es again understand assignment of shares and fees you also lose TODCO (THE) tax benefit with SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) but on smaller accounts this may BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) only viable option

options trading,options,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ton of experience trading options which is why Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of my posts and education Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) past and definitely know enough of TODCO (THE) basics to share for Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) traders that ask me about options on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) daily basis if you already have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of experience with options this post may not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very beneficial to you because Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) just going to cover TODCO (THE) basics of options how they work and give Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) quick rundown on ways that you can trade them

first and foremost what Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) options options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) actually options when you buy AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option contract you then have TODCO (THE) option to buy or sell TODCO (THE) underlying stock ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) predetermined price up to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) prespecified date if you decide to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) then exercising your options

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) two types of options that you can trade which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) call options and put options call options or just calls allow TODCO (THE) holder to buy ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) predetermined price and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) options equivalent to simply buying or longing TODCO (THE) underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow TODCO (THE) holder to sell ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) predetermined price and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) options equivalent to shortselling TODCO (THE) underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as TODCO (THE) underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of TODCO (THE) underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised

 

now TODCO (THE) predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares ALLTEL Corporation (AT) by exercising your option contracts is known as TODCO (THE) strike price when buying options you have to choose Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price along with AutoNation, Inc. (AN) expiration date which is TODCO (THE) last day that your options can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) exercised both TODCO (THE) strike price and expiration date play Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big role UNOVA, Inc. (IN) choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how TODCO (THE) options will trade before getting into why these have such Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big affect on TODCO (THE) options its important to know Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit more general options information

as for strike prices there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) really two main kinds UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money itm and out of TODCO (THE) money otm itm and otm refer to TODCO (THE) underlying stocks price UNOVA, Inc. (IN) relation to TODCO (THE) strike price of TODCO (THE) contract calls with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price below TODCO (THE) current price of TODCO (THE) underlying stock Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) considered itm whereas calls with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price above TODCO (THE) current price would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) considered otm on TODCO (THE) other side of TODCO (THE) spectrum since you want TODCO (THE) stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) itm if TODCO (THE) strike price is above TODCO (THE) current stock price and otm if TODCO (THE) strike price is below TODCO (THE) current stock price

 

i know its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit confusing if youre New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) to options to give AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example if stock xyz was trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call option with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price of  would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) itm since TODCO (THE) underlying stock is already above TODCO (THE) strike price however since calls and puts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) essentially opposite Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strike price of  would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) otm put UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this scenario

whether AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option is itm or otm Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big impact on how to option will trade TODCO (THE) main reason for this is because Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) otm options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) worthless ALLTEL Corporation (AT) expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option ALLTEL Corporation (AT)   USX Corporation (X)  your contract would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worth  if Gartner, Inc. (IT) was otm ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) markets close on TODCO (THE) expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) worthless ALLTEL Corporation (AT) expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) affected by time decay

time decay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options causes TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) contracts also known as TODCO (THE) premium to decrease as Gartner, Inc. (IT) gets closer to expiration this alone makes being Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profitable options trader much more difficult UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion because even if TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) underlying stocks remains TODCO (THE) same for days ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) time both calls and puts will decrease UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value because of TODCO (THE) time decay Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to profit from options you have to not only BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) right about TODCO (THE) stocks direction but you have to time Gartner, Inc. (IT) near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay

time decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) represented by what Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) known as greeks TODCO (THE) greeks Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) theta vega delta and gamma like i said TODCO (THE) meaning of this post is really just to cover TODCO (THE) basics Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) not going to go into Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) ton of detail on TODCO (THE) greeks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this post but i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least want to explain theta theta is TODCO (THE) greek representing time decay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) options theta along with TODCO (THE) other greeks before you even trade Gartner, Inc. (IT) and Gartner, Inc. (IT) can tell you how much TODCO (THE) contract is expected to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) affected by time decay generally TODCO (THE) theta will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  similarly theta will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) higher for options that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few weeks away from expiration compared to options Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few months away from expiration because they lose more value as TODCO (THE) expiration date approaches

theta makes general trading rules like dont fight TODCO (THE) trend even more important for example if you bought calls UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) downtrending stock because you thought that Gartner, Inc. (IT) was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate ALLTEL Corporation (AT) support Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this situation youd BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) correct about TODCO (THE) stock finding TODCO (THE) bottom but you would still lose money if Gartner, Inc. (IT) didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought TODCO (THE) underlying stock rather than call options youd BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) breakeven as TODCO (THE) stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating ALLTEL Corporation (AT) support

 

although time decay can have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) major negative impact on your options trades there is actually Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) way to have Gartner, Inc. (IT) work UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from TODCO (THE) price going down Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) time decay create profits for options that you sold short UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my opinion this should really only BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling

TODCO (THE) reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as TODCO (THE) options increase UNOVA, Inc. (IN) price its TODCO (THE) same reason that many people Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) afraid to shortsell stocks but options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend Gartner, Inc. (IT) for beginners i wanted to ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least explain TODCO (THE) concept of writing options UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this post

regardless of how you trade options its important to ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least understand Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) priced like any other type of trading you should only BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) using money that you can afford to lose UNOVA, Inc. (IN) its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading TODCO (THE) extremely volatile contracts that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) near their expiration which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) ones that attract Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many traders because of their ability to make big runs UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short period of time

maybe after this youll Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) traders think and can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) very dangerous for inexperienced traders that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) enticed by TODCO (THE) big potential returns

hope this was helpful let me know what ya think",1359,i understand Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) this TODCO (THE) thing i dont understand is how to not lose Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) my money,i started trading options this year  and let me tell ya you can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) right with calling TODCO (THE) direction of TODCO (THE) stock and still lose money on your call or put,"step deposit money

thanks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) advance",58,"every gimme Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) gotcha 


you can try to learn about TODCO (THE) greeks and how they work   but ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) day TODCO (THE) options greeks come out of TODCO (THE) options price they dont determine TODCO (THE) options price TODCO (THE) market buyers and sellers is what ultimately determines TODCO (THE) price black scholes is just Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(A) fancy model that is used to help describe TODCO (THE) physics of how AutoNation, Inc. (AN) options price moves TODCO (THE) mode is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good predictor but Gartner, Inc. (IT) isnt TODCO (THE) rule of law 



if youre going to go down TODCO (THE) path of greeks learn delta theta gamma and vega there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) more greeks but those  will cover what you need to know 


delta  you can think of this as TODCO (THE) chance that TODCO (THE) stock will end ALLTEL Corporation (AT) that price its also TODCO (THE) amount TODCO (THE)  options value will move based on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  move UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) stock Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) you buy Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(A)  delta and TODCO (THE) stock moves to  expect yourself to gain  cents not  on your call option   note closer to expiration TODCO (THE) delta starts to collapse meaning Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  delta is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot closer to TODCO (THE) stock price ALLTEL Corporation (AT) DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) than ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) 

gamma its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) derivative on delta Gartner, Inc. (IT) says how much delta changes with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  move UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) stock Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) did TODCO (THE) example above of TODCO (THE) delta was  and TODCO (THE) gamma was  then Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  move would make TODCO (THE) delta now change to    note closer to expiration gamma starts to grow exponentially

theta this is TODCO (THE) time component of options TODCO (THE) options will theoretically lose theta amount of value every day    as you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) closer to expiration TODCO (THE) theta on options starts to grow exponentially 

vega   kinda hard to explain this one but its essentially how TODCO (THE) options price changes according to TODCO (THE) volatility of TODCO (THE) market for TODCO (THE) stock   if vega is high youd have to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) iv rank or iv percentile to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Agilent Technologies, Inc.

now Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) that knowledge isnt going to help you trade my advice is sell puts on something like slv maybe  delta something like  days out and then  close TODCO (THE) position ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  days rinse and repeat   Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

(A) year and since slv is relatively safe you wont lose money but youll learn how options prices Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) impacted by price movements or by time if slv is too slow for you pick Agilent Technologies, Inc.

stock market prices,options,What I Learned From Citadel’s Training Software,"introduction

when i was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) finance undergrad one of TODCO (THE) classes i most looked forward to was financial trading strategies while other classes were academic with textbooks and powerpoint slides our professor was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) former market maker who taught us through handson experience throughout that semester our professor gave us  using TODCO (THE) same software citadel uses to train their traders  simulated trading cases each case taught us to trade from TODCO (THE) perspective of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) different market participant our grades didnt just depend on how much money we made but on TODCO (THE) pnl compared to our classmates ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) time TODCO (THE) stakes seemed higher than trading with real money

here Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some things i learned during that semester

 isolate your exposures and hedge whenever possible

 TODCO (THE) stat Arbitron Inc. (ARB) case

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) stat Arbitron Inc. (ARB) case we were commodity traders trying to run Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) location arbitrage strategy we could buy oil UNOVA, Inc. (IN) cheaper locations and transport Gartner, Inc. (IT) to places where oil was more expensive TODCO (THE) market was compensating us for providing supply UNOVA, Inc. (IN) markets with too much demand for oil and providing demand UNOVA, Inc. (IN) places with too much supply however we couldnt hedge our positions Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) our risk was that oil prices worldwide would fall before we could offload our inventory

this case emphasized TODCO (THE) importance of hedging even though every trade i made had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive expected value many of my trades were losers when oil prices fell i lost money because i wasnt just trading TODCO (THE) relative prices between locations but i also had unhedged exposure to TODCO (THE) global oil market

 TODCO (THE) portfolio management case

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) portfolio management case we were pms managing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) portfolio of  stocks our edge was that we knew TODCO (THE) fair value of each of them UNOVA, Inc. (IN) real life firms might have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) team of analysts studying each stock and not giving cnbc interviews our job was to take long positions UNOVA, Inc. (IN) undervalued or short overvalued stocks however our risk was that TODCO (THE) stocks might move even further from fair value UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) short term

i quickly learned to take opposing positions to limit my risk to TODCO (THE) overall market if i were only long Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bunch of stocks i could sustain heavy losses during market downturns similarly rally would demolish Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) shortonly portfolio combining long and short positions made my portfolio more or less neutral to TODCO (THE) broader market even if there were no overvalued stocks i made sure to short something  this insulated me from market crashes and allowed me to leverage my long positions UNOVA, Inc. (IN) undervalued stocks safely

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) options trading hedging is even more important many options traders who Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) wheeling selling cashsecured puts and covered calls have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of long equity short volatility positions and should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) hedging their portfolios maybe shorting AutoNation, Inc. (AN) index to balance out TODCO (THE) long equity exposure of Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) these puts may BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good idea delta hedging is also AutoNation, Inc. (AN) option buying options elsewhere to hedge TODCO (THE) short volatility exposure from these wheel positions can also protect your portfolio from drawdowns

 size your trades based on your edge

 TODCO (THE) etf arbitrage case

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) etf arbitrage simulation we were aps who could create and redeem shares of AutoNation, Inc. (AN) etf when TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) etf was higher than that of TODCO (THE) stocks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) etf we could buy TODCO (THE) stocks and create shares of TODCO (THE) expensive etf to sell similarly when TODCO (THE) etf became cheaper than TODCO (THE) stocks we could buy TODCO (THE) cheap etf and break Gartner, Inc. (IT) down into expensive stocks and sell them TODCO (THE) main risk was execution risk TODCO (THE) chance that our algo was broken or Gartner, Inc. (IT) was too slow executing trades after TODCO (THE) arbitrage was already gone

this trading simulation was reasonably straightforward but taught me one important lesson when there is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) arbitrage AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge with nearly no risk we must trade as much as possible before its gone UNOVA, Inc. (IN) most simulations i learned to maintain reasonable position sizes however etf arbitrage was nearly riskfree provided i wrote TODCO (THE) algo correctly if i didnt trade aggressively my classmates would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) and TODCO (THE) arbitrage opportunity would disappear

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) options markets we should take many trades UNOVA, Inc. (IN) small sizes systematic trading strategies such as selling weekly or monthly SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) options tend to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) profitable over time but only if TODCO (THE) trader is careful with their position sizing

 work harder than anyone else

this should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) obvious but for some reason Gartner, Inc. (IT) isnt many compete to make money UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) markets my class was no different TODCO (THE) pnl across TODCO (THE) various trading simulations determined what your grades were going to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) while we had some trading simulations that we could trade by hand we could choose to write algorithms to trade for us instead having studied each case beforehand i spent hours outside of class writing python scripts to trade on my behalf this allowed me to execute trades faster and more accurately than my classmates ever could by hand

 TODCO (THE) liability trading case

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) liability trading simulation we were brokers handling large orders for other institutional clients our edge was that as brokers we would receive bids for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) large amount of stock ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) slight premium or BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) offered large blocks of shares ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) discount however because these trades were Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) large we couldnt just close our positions immediately we had to split up our trades into several orders Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) they wouldnt push TODCO (THE) market around too much our risk was TODCO (THE) possibility of TODCO (THE) stock moving against us while we tried to sell our shares or cover our short positions over time

many of my classmates traded this simulation by hand they would receive AutoNation, Inc. (AN) order use AutoNation, Inc. (AN) excel spreadsheet to evaluate each trade and offload their positions manually those who traded by hand needed up to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) minute to process trades as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) result they were exposed to TODCO (THE) market for too long and many trades moved against them on TODCO (THE) other hand i processed orders UNOVA, Inc. (IN) four to five seconds because i was using AutoNation, Inc. (AN) algo to trade

 AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge exists for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reason its always about providing value

not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) single trading simulation involved technical analysis UNOVA, Inc. (IN) every trading simulation we had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) role and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) service to provide we had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reason our trading strategies were profitable we provided value UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market

liability traders help execute large trades for clients lacking TODCO (THE) infrastructure or patience market makers provide TODCO (THE) best bid and offer giving traders better prices when they want to enter and exit positions portfolio managers can help resolve supply and demand imbalances UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market buying oversupplied oversold securities they can also short highly demanded overvalued stocks finally aps help keep etf prices UNOVA, Inc. (IN) line with stock prices through arbitrage

retail traders should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) no different TODCO (THE) easiest services we can provide to TODCO (THE) market involve risk premiums and price inefficiencies

risk premiums involve holding risk that TODCO (THE) market tends to compensate traders for risk premiums include long equity  fixedincome positions supplying equity and debt capital and short options positions supplying options remember that not Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) risk is created equal day trading is risky but arguably provides no value to TODCO (THE) market

trading price inefficiencies generally involve providing liquidity to market participants who might BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) forced to trade ALLTEL Corporation (AT) bad prices we can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) paid by taking TODCO (THE) other side of forced trades which helps our counterparty Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) better price more on this UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) next point 

 not everyone is doing things for TODCO (THE) same reason trade with people who Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) forced to

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) real markets many people Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) forced to trade ALLTEL Corporation (AT) bad prices many institutional funds have rules that require them to buy options as Agilent Technologies, Inc.

 TODCO (THE) market making case

TODCO (THE) marketmaking simulation was one of TODCO (THE) hardest we provided quotes on three stocks and our job was to earn money collecting TODCO (THE) bidask spread TODCO (THE) hard part was keeping TODCO (THE) spread since we were often on TODCO (THE) wrong side of trades Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) wave of buying would leave us short stock while TODCO (THE) market rallied and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) wave of selling would leave us holding TODCO (THE) bag while we collected TODCO (THE) spread with every trade keeping our positions neutral was extremely difficult

Ingram Micro Inc.

(IN) my next iteration i decided to change my strategy rather than competing with other mms for orders i would wait for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) wave of buy orders and join them these orders alongside my own caused my classmates algorithms to shift their prices higher and higher as they desperately attempted to cover their short positions i would then helpfully sell them my stock ALLTEL Corporation (AT) inflated prices sometimes i would Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Agilent Technologies, Inc.

    for more developed equities like Google Inc. (GOOG) Micron Technology, Inc.

    for more growth oriented equities like rblx and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM) she selected Leap Wireless International, Inc.

(IM) not following why you would want to put on this trade 

  
Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) to summarize on one june nymex hh contract youre collecting  up front with TODCO (THE) dollar risk of if TODCO (THE) price goes to TODCO (THE) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment strike of  next day youd have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) estimated risk and margin increase of what you listed total  which i agree would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) unlikely there is also TODCO (THE) assignment risk if TODCO (THE) option expires UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) money then youd BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) obligated to purchase  mmbtus Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Kellogg Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (K) needed UNOVA, Inc. (IN) margin or cash actual capital required buying power is about  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (ROC) of about  on this singular trade max loss of  if TODCO (THE) Nicor Inc. (GAS) contract goes to zero which again id agree would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) quite unlikely

  
while your riskreward on collateral is fine ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  your riskreward on TODCO (THE) prices falling between current to strike price let alone max risk is terrible TODCO (THE) actual max return plummets to probably below  depending on how much margin you have to lock up you have some comfort that if your put gets assigned ALLTEL Corporation (AT) below  youd BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) long  mmbtus of Nicor Inc. (GAS) which is not bad  
TODCO (THE) riskreward ratio is just not worth Gartner, Inc. (IT) on those numbers there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) definitely better ways to add delta to your portfolio or short vol or find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) different strike with more extrinsic and hedge with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long put

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) conclusion squeezing out   cents Perot Systems Corporation (PER) contract over  DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) is not TODCO (THE) best position to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) holding i mean you definitely can and i would think if youre willing to put up s of margin if prices drop below this level you can probably Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) that premium but seeing how you havent listed out TODCO (THE) Nicor Inc. (GAS) fundamental outlook for this spring this is ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) moderate risk extremely Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) reward sort of trade i would advise just leaving this alone 

now if prices drop  from here back to  or less then this would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) different discussion and this sort of trade would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) more interesting to put on then"

this is how wallstreetbets define their community for those who dont know  is one of TODCO (THE) biggest stock market communities UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) world having more than mm members its where millions Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) made and lost every day on outrageous bets and TODCO (THE) only place where losses Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) celebrated as much as TODCO (THE) wins

whether its for TODCO (THE) insane yolos posted every day or breaking robinghood with infinite leverage plays or TODCO (THE) legendary shortsqueeze involving Gamestop Corporation (GME) wallstreetbets is where TODCO (THE) action goes down  sums up TODCO (THE) absolute chaos that rwallstreetbets is

but what we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) interested UNOVA, Inc. (IN) is to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) if we can beat TODCO (THE) market by using TODCO (THE) stock picks made on wallstreetbets after Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL)





data

reddits praw api and pushshift api were used to obtain TODCO (THE) data for this analysis there were more than  million comments and posts made on wsb UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  i have had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) vm running for collecting TODCO (THE) live data from Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) financial subreddits since dec

(A) google sheet but if you want access to TODCO (THE) full historical data you can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Gartner, Inc. (IT) from 



analysis

ahh this is where Gartner, Inc. (IT) gets tricky there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) multiple ways to consider what constitutes Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) recommendation from wsb since there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) millions of comments its not realistic to invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) each and every recommendation made on TODCO (THE) subreddit

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) what i have done to simplify this is to calculate TODCO (THE) most popular tickers for each day  why i settled on this logic is because Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock from this list is what Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) person is most likely to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) when heshe would randomly browse through TODCO (THE) subreddit and TODCO (THE) higher TODCO (THE) number of mentions TODCO (THE) more TODCO (THE) chances of investing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) said stock

considering TODCO (THE) practical limitations i kept TODCO (THE) cutoff ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) top  stocks once we have found TODCO (THE) top  discussed stocks of that day we invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) them ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) market close then we calculate TODCO (THE) returns generated by TODCO (THE) stocks over TODCO (THE) next

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) one week

b one month

Citigroup, Inc. (C) till date  from TODCO (THE) date of investment to today

TODCO (THE) benchmark for comparison is SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) we will compare TODCO (THE) returns against SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) if TODCO (THE) most popular recommendations generated by TODCO (THE) platform can beat returns by SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) during TODCO (THE) same time period 



results

before we jump into TODCO (THE) returns here is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) visualization of how TODCO (THE) most popular stocks have changed over TODCO (THE) last year UNOVA, Inc. (IN) wsb



 UNOVA, Inc. (IN) case TODCO (THE) visualization is not loading  



we would have made Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) grand total of  investments  UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  following this strategy we would have lost money on more than  over TODCO (THE) next week and more than  over TODCO (THE) next month but if you consider till date we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) slightly above  if you compare this to SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) its AutoNation, Inc. (AN) extremely poor performance as during TODCO (THE) same period SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) would have given Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive return of  over one week  over one month and  till date as SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) is trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) alltime high now

but TODCO (THE) stock market rewards predictions disproportionately  out of TODCO (THE)  stocks you pick even if you Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET)  wrong but Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) extremely high which is what wsb is aiming for  its definitely not for safe plays

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) how Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) TODCO (THE) average performance of wsb picks fared



would you look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) that wsb recommendations have hands down beaten SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) across Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) time periods Gartner, Inc. (IT) gave Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  overperformance over TODCO (THE) period of one week and  over one month and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) whopping  if you had held on to your stocks

but keep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) mind that your performance is skewed towards Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few stocks which got featured repeatedly UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) top  list



Gamestop Corporation (GME) Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) top discussed stocks UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  of TODCO (THE) days and on average you would have gained  if you invested UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Gartner, Inc. (IT) every day both amc and tsla Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) close followers with both of them giving substantial returns among TODCO (THE) other ones who have made TODCO (THE) list repeatedly only bb clov and wish on average have lost money 

now that our main question is out of TODCO (THE) way we can really Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) deep dive into TODCO (THE) data and Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) some interesting patterns



unsurprisingly gamestop and amc Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) top of TODCO (THE) pile with Gamestop Corporation (GME) returning AutoNation, Inc. (AN) insane  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) one week even if you remove Gamestop Corporation (GME) and amc due to TODCO (THE) unlikely scenario of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) shortsqueeze TODCO (THE) other  stocks would have doubled your investment UNOVA, Inc. (IN) one week 



for every winner there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) bound to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) losers if you bought into Gamestop Corporation (GME) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) top of TODCO (THE) rally you would have lost  of your investment UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) next week Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) other companies on TODCO (THE) list had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) brief jump UNOVA, Inc. (IN) popularity but folks who invested UNOVA, Inc. (IN) that ended up holding TODCO (THE) bag

but what if you did not want to invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  stocks every day what if you only wanted to invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) top stock of TODCO (THE) day ie TODCO (THE) one creating TODCO (THE) most discussion would you have beaten TODCO (THE) market



unsurprisingly you would have beaten TODCO (THE) market by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) wide margin this is mainly due to TODCO (THE) insane returns generated by Gamestop Corporation (GME) amc tsla etc which came to TODCO (THE) top of TODCO (THE) list you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) just being rewarded for TODCO (THE) high amount of risks you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) taking by putting Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) your investment into Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few stocks  



limitations

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some limitations to this analysis which you should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) aware of

 as explained UNOVA, Inc. (IN) footnote there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE)  days of missing data  though this is not going to affect TODCO (THE) results UNOVA, Inc. (IN) any significant way as its lesser than  of TODCO (THE) total days UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) analysis
 this analysis does not consider options which is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big part of what wsb is made of TODCO (THE) returns from options can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) wildly different from what we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) observing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) case of buying stocks
 we have just considered TODCO (THE) last year of data where Gartner, Inc. (IT) was predominantly Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies TODCO (THE) results might BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) different if we expand our time horizon
 finally TODCO (THE) above analysis only considers TODCO (THE) chatter and not TODCO (THE) sentiment about TODCO (THE) stock i would invest no matter if people Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) saying positive or negative things about TODCO (THE) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) my hypothesis is that we would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish TODCO (THE) sentiment UNOVA, Inc. (IN) comments Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) part of this analysis incorporating sentiment is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) works  stay tuned 



conclusion

before starting TODCO (THE) analysis i fully expected to end Gartner, Inc. (IT) with

TODCO (THE) real returns were TODCO (THE) friends we made and TODCO (THE) Cedar Fair, L.P. (FUN) we had along TODCO (THE) way

i was expecting that TODCO (THE) chatter UNOVA, Inc. (IN) wsb would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lagging follower of TODCO (THE) stock price rally and TODCO (THE) people who invest UNOVA, Inc. (IN) them would end up holding TODCO (THE) bag

but i was pleasantly surprised to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that on average TODCO (THE) stock that made Gartner, Inc. (IT) to TODCO (THE) trending list beat SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) returns that too across different time periods

either its due to TODCO (THE) selffulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause TODCO (THE) stock to rally even more or Gartner, Inc. (IT) might just BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) that wsb is TODCO (THE) place where we can successfully leverage TODCO (THE) 

whatever TODCO (THE) case may BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock that rallies  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) one week only to drop  UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value next week and then finish net positive by TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) year for that you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) rewarded with marketbeating returns

trading strategy,options,My most profitable options trading strategy: 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condors,"UNOVA, Inc. (IN) april i started trading TODCO (THE) DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) breakeven iron condor strategy this Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) far been my profitable strategy

since Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) year Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) started i have summed up my results from this strategy after  trading days and  individual trades

using AutoNation, Inc. (AN) average buying power of up to    dollars i have made  dollars on this strategy during these nine months  for me that is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fantastic return ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least compared to other strategies i have tried Gartner, Inc. (IT) is also less stressful than other DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) strategies as you rarely experience days with big losses

here is TODCO (THE) essence of TODCO (THE) strategy

i sell iron condors on spx with TODCO (THE) delta on TODCO (THE) shorts between  and  TODCO (THE) distance to TODCO (THE) longs Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) from  to  points on spx  i try to collect TODCO (THE) same premium on both sides

immediately afterward i enter stop losses for each side for just Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) little more than TODCO (THE) total premium collected for TODCO (THE) iron condor  since usually only TODCO (THE) stop loss on one side is Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) this means that TODCO (THE) losses Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) kept ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) minimum hence TODCO (THE) name breakeven

TODCO (THE) tight stop loss of course leads to more losses of my  trades   have been losers and   have been winners but since TODCO (THE) average winner is  times larger than TODCO (THE) average loser TODCO (THE) strategy Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive expectancy

there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) of course risks  TODCO (THE) biggest being double stop losses that happened UNOVA, Inc. (IN)   of my trades Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) far another risk as with any DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) strategy is bad stop loss fills

from my perspective TODCO (THE) most positive with TODCO (THE) strategy is that losses Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) kept Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) small but to achieve this stop losses Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) absolute must

(IT) was but then again expectations were basically zero Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) whole mental side of Gartner, Inc. (IT) never got UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) way kind of fascinating to think about that too and how my own ignorance was Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) blessing to that style iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried to go back and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few times seeing if i can reignite that but i honestly Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my own way with Gartner, Inc. (IT) i now know too much or think i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) which i clearly Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not and either Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) spooked UNOVA, Inc. (IN) one way or just Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) overwhelmed with Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) different info and make TODCO (THE) wrong choice 

either way would love to hear some other stupidly simple strategies that worked ALLTEL Corporation (AT) some point",828,"buy super cheap way otm microsoft options like  days out wait until TODCO (THE) price went up then drop them i was averaging  Agilent Technologies, Inc.

then i discovered debit spreads and Gartner, Inc.

trading strategy,options,This has been my most profitable 0DTE options trading strategy,"for  months TODCO (THE) DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) breakeven iron condor Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been my most profitable options strategy UNOVA, Inc. (IN) fact only one month january  ended with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) loss

many have asked how TODCO (THE) strategy did UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) turbulent first half of  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i decided to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) writeup you find TODCO (THE) article here 

TODCO (THE) strategy is quite simple i sell iron condors on spx ALLTEL Corporation (AT)    delta ALLTEL Corporation (AT) different times of TODCO (THE) day  i set separate stop losses on each of TODCO (THE) two spreads equal to TODCO (THE) total premium of TODCO (THE) ic typically i add  dollars on top of that usually i let TODCO (THE) iron condors expire but i will also sometimes close them early to lock UNOVA, Inc. (IN) some profit 

this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very tight stop loss compared to what most people Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) and yes Gartner, Inc. (IT) will lead to more losses yet TODCO (THE) strategy as such Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) proven profitable

here is TODCO (THE) summary after trading this strategy from april  until today

 i have done  trades usually i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO)  trades Perot Systems Corporation (PER) day
 TODCO (THE) win rate Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been   and TODCO (THE) loss rate   this Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) stayed very consistent during this period
 Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) trades Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) with one contract only  and i will never commit more than  usd UNOVA, Inc. (IN) buying power which means that i will have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) maximum of  trades on simultaneously but usually less
 i have made  dollars on TODCO (THE) strategy Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) far for TODCO (THE) oneyear period of august  to july  i made  which is   of my max buying power committed to TODCO (THE) strategy
 TODCO (THE) average win  dollars is  times as high as TODCO (THE) average loss  dollars  hence TODCO (THE) positive expectancy despite most trades being losses
 TODCO (THE) biggest risk to TODCO (THE) strategy is double stop losses this Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) happened UNOVA, Inc. (IN)   of my trades this percentage Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) stayed quite consistent as well during TODCO (THE) whole period

this is not TODCO (THE) only DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) strategy i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) on spx but i like that i rarely have days with big losses Gartner, Inc. (IT) fits my trading style and risk willingness

trading strategy,options,Most leveraged option trading strategy for a strategy,"hi folks

i have developed Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) long strategy with  win rate TODCO (THE) strategy is aimed for being Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profitloss UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  weeksthe price traget is like  usd above from current price

exif spot price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is usd my strategy predicts with  accuracy if price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) will reach  usd over TODCO (THE) next  weeks timeframe

TODCO (THE) challenge with this strategy is that we dont know when NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)  would reach that price target UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE)  week timeframe ie NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) could reach Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A . (PT) hypothetically tomorrow or may BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) end of second weeki havent found Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) single strategy that could cover both these scenarios ex short dated options provide maximum leverage if Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) reached TODCO (THE) price traget UNOVA, Inc.

(IN)  weeksi American Greetings Corporation (AM) not considering butterfly as Gartner, Inc. (IT) only gains value around option expiry and around TODCO (THE) short strike levels

my question is  could there BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) any strategy that could give like  return for price target  being reached UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short time frame or price target being reached UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) little longer time ex weeks

nbi have already played around with optionstrat and still could not find anything solid

editi may not have been clear when i Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) return i mean return on riskthis is different from return on my opening Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST)

editthe reason for  return is to have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) positive expectancy for TODCO (THE) strategytjeoretivally even Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  return would give me  return on averagehowever i need to aim higher to account for  market turmoils that could break Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) strategies

thanks UNOVA, Inc. (IN) advance",1,"yes its called long ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) moment calls dont overthink Gartner, Inc.

Tommy Hilfiger Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) Inc (TOM) sosnoff of tastytrade  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) young trader named carter UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) live stream from thu  dec  if you dont want to watch TODCO (THE) interview heres Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) summary of his strategy

trader

carter dobbelmann Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) yearold from Banco Santiago, S.A. (SAN) jose Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA)

claim to fame

turned  into  within  years

affiliations

 hes on hourglass trader google Gartner, Inc. (IT)
 Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) replied to comments on TODCO (THE) tastytrade video

strategy selling volatility

 exclusively trades options
 roughly follows what tastytrade recommends
 initially gambled with Swiss Exchange (SIX) significantly otm long calls on tsla to go from  to  without knowing anything about TODCO (THE) stock market options or trading and getting extremely lucky then gambled  on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) calls and blew away  to drop down to  after learning Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) more reasonable way of trading Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) looks for highiv underlyings and

 shorts puts for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) credit
 shorts call spreads for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) credit and
 shorts put spreads for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) credit

 because Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) sells high volatility hes always looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) iv rank

tactics

 trades with TODCO (THE) trend of TODCO (THE) underlying using vertical spreads
 runs short call spreads when Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock breaks down and short puts spreads when Gartner, Inc. (IT) rallies
 if Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) sees evidence that AutoNation, Inc. (AN) active play is reversing hell add TODCO (THE) opposite spread type from what Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) initially did if Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) shorted Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call spread hed short Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put spread or if Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) shorted Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) put spread hed short Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) call spread

trade parameters

 sets otm striking prices going Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) little above or below TODCO (THE) expected move based on   and ta
 uses DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE)    days usually not more than  days on individual companies
 uses DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE)    on spx

underlyings

 is indifferent to TODCO (THE) underlying
 says Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) plays indexes eg spx
 initially Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) traded clov and amc
 Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) recently played Siemens AGCO Corporation (AG) (SI) and Gamestop Corporation (GME)

trading activity

 Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) places  to  trades Perot Systems Corporation (PER) day
 Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) maintains Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) portfolio of fifteen concurrent positions with many different underlyings
 with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  account hes likely risking  on each position

profittaking

 Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) exits whenever Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) captures  to  of TODCO (THE) maximum theoretical profit usually closer to TODCO (THE) latter
 because Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) uses distributed expirations eg DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE)     days Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) takes profits virtually every day

risk management

 if Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) ran Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short call spread and TODCO (THE) underlying kept moving up hed roll TODCO (THE) spread up and widen TODCO (THE) striking prices
 this implies that if Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) ran Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) short put spread and TODCO (THE) underlying keeps moving down hed roll TODCO (THE) spread down and widen TODCO (THE) striking prices
 Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) doesnt hold beyond TODCO (THE) point of capturing  of TODCO (THE) maximal theoretical profit to try to minimize risk
 Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) manages risk very actively and aggressively

my thoughts

this gives us AutoNation, Inc. (AN) outline of what hes doing but TODCO (THE) devil is UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) details and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot is missing without knowing what iv rank threshold and other criteria hes using for scanning for underlyings TODCO (THE) spread width what decisionmaking criteria Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) uses to trigger Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) roll etc we just dont have enough information to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to try to replicate this

we also dont know anything about how hes making decisions about where TODCO (THE) market is likely to go overall trading during TODCO (THE) week of Monsanto Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (MON)  dec  might BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) dangerous because more macroeconomic data is being released on tue  dec TODCO (THE) cpi will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) released TODCO (THE) following day TODCO (THE) fed will announce its interest rate decision ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  pm E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ET) followed half AutoNation, Inc. (AN) hour later by TODCO (THE) jpows press conference Gartner, Inc. (IT) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) imprudent to try to trade oblivious to these important macroeconomic catalysts

this interview is interesting but ultimately leaves us guessing without additional information and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) comprehensive list of trades over Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) threemonth period Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) that we could look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) transaction times and replay TODCO (THE) price action to understand TODCO (THE) decisionmaking i think that its impossible to truly figure out what Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trader is doing and whether Gartner, Inc. (IT) could have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sustainable edge what would help TODCO (THE) most is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) excel spreadsheet containing every trades transaction time action and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) justification for that action its impossible to reverseengineer what weve heard UNOVA, Inc. (IN) just TODCO (THE) interview well enough to put Gartner, Inc. (IT) to TODCO (THE) test

we can reduce TODCO (THE) unknowns by just focusing on spx if someone can track carter down Gartner, Inc. (IT) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) interesting to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) him to fill UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) blanks we really need to understand how Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) minimizes losses from positions that go against him to manage risk aggressively what triggers him to roll Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) position and how soon UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) life cycle of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trade thats UNOVA, Inc. (IN) trouble does Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this

 example i sold some of TODCO (THE) january straddles on rivn when they released options this week ALLTEL Corporation (AT) around  iv its now ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  



i was able to capture  vegas UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  day

this could have gone TODCO (THE) other way but Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of work went into pricing TODCO (THE) fair value of iv here actually have Gartner, Inc. (IT) much lower than where Gartner, Inc. (IT) is now and UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this lesson i will go into how to think about trading implied volatility levels and price Gartner, Inc. (IT) out for yourself

 most traders only think about trading implied volatility vs realized volatility

or what we might refer to as theta gang strategies but there is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) whole world of opportunity out there to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) explored by trading how TODCO (THE) actual implied volatility number changes for options

 this post will go UNOVA, Inc. (IN) depth on how to trade TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility and how TODCO (THE) pnl for Gartner, Inc. (IT) works

TODCO (THE) reason i bring this up is that i have spent some time looking into mispriced options UNOVA, Inc. (IN) longer dated options and i think there is lots of edge to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) found there but UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to take advantage of this we need to understand how to price and trade TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility

note these Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) advanced trades theres good returns to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) made but Gartner, Inc. (IT) can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) absolutely brutal if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) on TODCO (THE) wrong side having Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strong thesis and good position management Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) must

 its Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) about that vega baby

trading is Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) about finding where you disagree with TODCO (THE) market and then expressing your view on that disagreement correctly

if we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) trading TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility we need to make sure we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) exposed to change UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility

options off TODCO (THE) bat Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) sensitive to this through one of TODCO (THE) greeks called vega vega is TODCO (THE) change UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) option price for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  point change UNOVA, Inc. (IN) implied volatility

for example if implied volatility went from  to  vega tells us how that would impact TODCO (THE) price of TODCO (THE) option we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) if our vega was  TODCO (THE) position would change UNOVA, Inc. (IN) value by 

 what options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) most sensitive to vega

TODCO (THE) primary way to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of vega exposure is to go further out UNOVA, Inc. (IN) time

when go very far out UNOVA, Inc. (IN) time you have very little gamma and therefore very little theta TODCO (THE) primary exposure is vega which creates Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) somewhat linear trade

 for example here is TODCO (THE) greeks for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) jan  straddle on SPDR Trust Series I (SPY)

xb



as you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) we have very little sensitivity  to delta gamma theta but AutoNation, Inc. (AN) unbelievably bigger sensitivity to vega this is why we consider these to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) linear trades for TODCO (THE) most part TODCO (THE) pnl really moves up or down with changes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) implied volatility 

what about nearer dated options  lets take Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) straddle on SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) that expires this week 

xb



when we reduce TODCO (THE) time to expiration vega is much less impactful as you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) when we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) expiring soon gamma and theta run TODCO (THE) show primarily

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) either situation if implied volatility goes up you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to make your vega  if implied volatility goes down you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to lose your vega  Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) when trying to monetize implied volatility dislocations looking further out UNOVA, Inc. (IN) time is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good idea

 Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) slightly gruesome analogy to understand vega vs theta trading

imagine Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) person who finds out that they have  day to live they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to expire UNOVA, Inc. (IN) one day what happens UNOVA, Inc. (IN) that one day before expiry means Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot to them if they have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bad day Gartner, Inc. (IT) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) devastating and good day would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) euphoric

Gartner, Inc. (IT) makes sense they need to maximize on today TODCO (THE) outcome of this day is definitive of TODCO (THE) quality of their life

now imagine another person who Hasbro, Inc. (HAS)  years left to live

Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sudden what happens today isnt such Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) big deal theres lots of days left Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) if today was mediocre its not TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) world Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) what does this person focus on whats really important to how they feel and TODCO (THE) trajectory of their life its their outlook on their future and what they Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) for down TODCO (THE) road

 just like TODCO (THE) person with  day to live shorter dated options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) really sensitive to things that happen today Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of theta Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of gamma

on further dated options just like TODCO (THE) person with  years left to live its more Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) outlook on TODCO (THE) future that matters if your option expires UNOVA, Inc. (IN)  years its ok for TODCO (THE) most part if TODCO (THE) stock moves above its average daily move today  but if Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sudden TODCO (THE) future of TODCO (THE) business goes from stable to uncertain TODCO (THE) value of your options will change drastically TODCO (THE) reason Gartner, Inc. (IT) will change drastically is because theres lots of vega or exposure to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) change implied volatility

there is money to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) made where TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility is different than what we think Gartner, Inc. (IT) should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE)

 is there money to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) made trading TODCO (THE) longer dated options

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of people think you cant make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of money trading longer dated options Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) people will maybe buy leaps and sell covered calls against them since TODCO (THE) Leap Wireless International, Inc. (LEAP) is not very sensitive to volatility but as i hope you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) starting to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) this can not BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) further from TODCO (THE) truth

for example lets take Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trade that was shared with me on arkx

when Gartner, Inc. (IT) became optionable this year Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) friend of mine shared some research on TODCO (THE) longer dated options that was really interesting TODCO (THE)  year options were trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  implied volatility and our conclusion was that they were worth  implied volatility  over TODCO (THE) next couple months Gartner, Inc. (IT) came Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) way down Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A)  point drop UNOVA, Inc. (IN) implied volatility

xb



Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) TODCO (THE) question is how profitable was TODCO (THE) trade

here is what TODCO (THE) position looked like ALLTEL Corporation (AT) inception take Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) our greeks as you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE)

xb



heres what Gartner, Inc. (IT) looked like ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) end

xb



 TODCO (THE) options basically got cut UNOVA, Inc. (IN) half

because of TODCO (THE) nature of this trade and TODCO (THE) confidence UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) research myself and TODCO (THE) others i know UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this position were able to scale up pretty big

 what was really interesting is how wrong TODCO (THE) markets pricing was

as we go further out UNOVA, Inc. (IN) time there tends to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) less liquidity on some of these names when you go further out theres just less eyes on Gartner, Inc. (IT) that means opportunity

for example on rivn myself and TODCO (THE) others i was looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) this trade with basically made up Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of TODCO (THE) longer dated volume early on tuesday 

because of how poorly Gartner, Inc. (IT) was being priced and TODCO (THE) thoroughness of TODCO (THE) research we did i was able to scale up on this position significantly iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found that theres actually Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of opportunity like arkx that comes around Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) now lets discuss Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple of basic ways to price these out and find these opportunities

 idea generation

something that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) noticed is when realized volatility spikes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) near term sometimes TODCO (THE) whole term structure will elevate and TODCO (THE) back can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) really out of line

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i typically look for these types of trades when bad news Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) come out around Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock industry or sector

examples of times that i have traded this way

 when archegos blew up longer dated vols on TODCO (THE) companies that were held by TODCO (THE) fund stayed elevated post event
 arkx release options were pretty illiquid and very poorly priced anticipating Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot more volatility than Gartner, Inc. (IT) should have given TODCO (THE) underlying stocks
 tsla longer dated options were being priced ALLTEL Corporation (AT) extremely high levels given TODCO (THE) size of TODCO (THE) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) and relative to correlated assets
 kweb pricing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) extremely high volatility higher than covid because of chinese market issues
 rivn starting to release options and pricing them ALLTEL Corporation (AT) insane levels of implied volatility

 how to price TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) example

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) order to explain how to go about pricing TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility i American Greetings Corporation (AM) going to go through Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trade that i took earlier this year on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA)

keep UNOVA, Inc. (IN) mind that this is TODCO (THE) sentence we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trying to complete TODCO (THE) market is showing me that TODCO (THE) stock is trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) implied volatility of USX Corporation (X) i think TODCO (THE) level of implied vol should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Alleghany Corporation (Y)

 TODCO (THE) situation

earlier this year when TODCO (THE) archegos fund blew up TODCO (THE) stocks that Gartner, Inc. (IT) was holding took Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) massive Hitachi, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (HIT) simply put they got crushed this lead to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) massive opportunity that was missed by much of TODCO (THE) retail community TODCO (THE) options market went berserk 

before TODCO (THE) fund blew up TODCO (THE) fair value for options were around  iv 

but when everything exploded TODCO (THE) crazy movement UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) short term caused TODCO (THE) whole option chain to lift up Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) sudden TODCO (THE)  day and  day options were trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  iv

for perspective iv was ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  during covid for TODCO (THE) same DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE)

basically things look really crazy Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i set out to price TODCO (THE) options and try to uncover Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trade

 there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) two ways to price TODCO (THE) options here absolute value and relative value lets go over each way for Discovery Holding Co (DISCA)

  example of absolute value pricing

absolute value pricing involves comparing what we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) seeing today for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock against what we have seen UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) past 

Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) july options were trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  iv before TODCO (THE) archegos liquidation as TODCO (THE) event happened implied volatility shot up to  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple days later when TODCO (THE) event was over Gartner, Inc. (IT) was still ALLTEL Corporation (AT)  iv 

xb



thinking about how options Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) priced Gartner, Inc. (IT) would make sense that TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility came down here since TODCO (THE) impact from TODCO (THE) event had happened already assuming there were no further chain reactions and therefore TODCO (THE) level of implied vol should come back down to what Gartner, Inc. (IT) was preevent or 

TODCO (THE) reason i didt think there would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) chain reactions is that TODCO (THE) realized volatility basically stopped after TODCO (THE) event check this out

xb



 with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) normal implied volatility of  TODCO (THE) event over and rv returning to normal Gartner, Inc. (IT) seemed reasonable to expect TODCO (THE) iv to come back down to TODCO (THE)  range

  example of relative value pricing

relative value pricing is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) extremely powerful way to price options Gartner, Inc. (IT) involves comparing TODCO (THE) options for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) interested UNOVA, Inc. (IN) against other stocks that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) correlated 

for example Coca-Cola Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (KO) and Pepsico, Inc. (PEP) Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) strongly correlated they have similar levels of implied volatility take Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) this pic

xb



TODCO (THE) above picture is showing  blue  Pepsico, Inc. (PEP)  day iv green  Coca-Cola Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (KO)  day iv bottom green  ratio between Coca-Cola Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (KO) and Pepsico, Inc. (PEP)  day iv

as you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) they move together when Coca-Cola Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (KO) vol goes up Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) does Pepsico, Inc. (PEP)

looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) ratio you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) they have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) average ratio between them that they mean revert around this is because they have correlated movements and implied volatilities when TODCO (THE) spread between them gets too large we Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Gartner, Inc. (IT) close 

now imagine we saw this

xb



TODCO (THE) red line is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) hypothetical situation where TODCO (THE) ratio between them shot up

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this situation we could also Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) that there is AutoNation, Inc. (AN) opportunity to trade TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility for these companies

we could buy vol on TODCO (THE) lower iv one sell vol on TODCO (THE) higher one or we could look for which Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG) is inefficient and likely to change TODCO (THE) most and just trade that one

 Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) how did i use relative value pricing to trade Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) 

first i went out to find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) correlated stock TODCO (THE) one i settled on was foxa then i plotted TODCO (THE) ivs for each of them and looked ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) ratio 

xb



as you can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) time of TODCO (THE) disaster TODCO (THE) iv went through TODCO (THE) roof since foxa was not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) part of TODCO (THE) disaster Gartner, Inc. (IT) was clear that Gartner, Inc. (IT) wasnt really AutoNation, Inc. (AN) industry impacting event and that when TODCO (THE) disaster is over TODCO (THE) volatility should return to something back UNOVA, Inc. (IN) line with this correlation 

 with AutoNation, Inc. (AN) average ratio of about  and foxa trading ALLTEL Corporation (AT) around  iv Gartner, Inc. (IT) seemed reasonable that we should Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) volatility come back to around    iv

my analysis on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) painted Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very clear picture of what should happen to TODCO (THE) options after TODCO (THE) event because i had done enough Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG) work to develop Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good thesis i was able to pack on some size and make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fantastic return 

 both my absolute value and relative value narrowed down on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) similar fair value for implied volatility on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) between  and 

from here i went and sold july straddles on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) and sure enough TODCO (THE) iv came down to my expected fair value and i was able to Veriphone Holdings, Inc. (PAY) for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) nice vacation  

i closed out this position when Gartner, Inc. (IT) was pretty much ALLTEL Corporation (AT) my fair value 

on TODCO (THE) flip side if this trade had gone against me i would have to go back to TODCO (THE) drawing board and really dig into my thesis holding these types of positions through iv spikes can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) catastrophic if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) wrong Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of work would have to go into why its moving against me 

on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) couple other positions Gartner, Inc. (IT) Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) moved against me UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) short term but then i have been right UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) end of TODCO (THE) day weathering those storms is no joke though especially if you have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) meaningful amount of money on TODCO (THE) line this is why i always stress TODCO (THE) importance of knowing your stuff before scaling up your trades

 conclusion

by knowing how to price TODCO (THE) level of implied volatility you can develop really strong ideas that can yield great returns this Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been one of my primary strategies this year especially with TODCO (THE) meme stock craze tensions UNOVA, Inc. (IN) china etc 

 important point

this is not about just selling high iv Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of TODCO (THE) times iv is high for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reason this is about pricing iv and selling when Gartner, Inc. (IT) is expensive

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of traders make TODCO (THE) mistake of selling because its high but i hope this post helps you think different about volatility and gives you some ideas about where you can find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) real edge UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market 

remember once you have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) idea of where iv should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) you can make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trade if its different than what TODCO (THE) market is pricing

 if you have ay questions leave Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) comment and ill try my best to help

previous parts of this series     read these and Gartner, Inc. (IT) will hopefully lay some groundwork for this post

 Gartner, Inc. (IT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) starts with idea generation

this is where i find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of people struggle but Gartner, Inc. (IT) should actually BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) one of TODCO (THE) easiest parts of strategy development 

for you to have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) profitable system you just need to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) better than TODCO (THE) next guy Gartner, Inc. (IT) doesnt need to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) super fancy or complicated 

think about Gartner, Inc. (IT) like you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) electrician UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your local town currently theres some guy making Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) money for fixes UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) area if you can find some sort of advantage now youll BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) TODCO (THE) guy making Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) money maybe you can Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) jobs done faster maybe you sell better maybe your price is lower 

note AutoNation, Inc. (AN) idea alone is worthless just like UNOVA, Inc. (IN) business ideas dont make money execution is what makes money 

note your idea cant BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) too general Gartner, Inc. (IT) cant just BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) i want to sell options Gartner, Inc. (IT) needs to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) more specific with that being said Gartner, Inc. (IT) doesnt need to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) something super complex 

ALLTEL Corporation (AT) this point we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) just deciding on something we want to investigate 

examples of good things to explore

 is TODCO (THE) implied variance risk premium higher on etfs than stocks
 where is TODCO (THE) variance risk premium TODCO (THE) highest across us equities
 is selling vol on Techne Corporation (TECH) stocks and buying vol on finance Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good pairs trade
 can we forecast earnings straddle pnls

 Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trading edge Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) distinct characteristics

below is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) list of different things that can lead to AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) market i share these to spark some ideas Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) that you can think about where you should look for AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge given your unique situation

xb

 data access Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) you have access to better data that no one else does example imagine TODCO (THE) number of species UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) marianas trench could predict tomorrows SPDR Trust Series I (SPY) price well no one Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) that data Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) if you did you would have more knowledge than everyone else and youd make TODCO (THE) most money 
 skillsets if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) competing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) capacity space where there is lots of individuals and not Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many teams having strong data science skills pull UNOVA, Inc. (IN) data manipulate and transform TODCO (THE) data  could give you AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge and help you build your trading business 
 your network Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) you have access to people who can give you good ideas example private equity deals  having Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) network of professional traders to collab with etc 
 specialization if you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) corporate lawyer can you figure out ma deals better than TODCO (THE) next guy if you work UNOVA, Inc. (IN) small cap Techne Corporation (TECH) can you figure out software development cycles and product release dates better than TODCO (THE) next guy Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) you Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) doctor who understands biotech better than TODCO (THE) next guy
 geography you can only trade certain products when you live UNOVA, Inc. (IN) certain places this also incorporates regulatory issues too 
 being first to AutoNation, Inc. (AN) idea i guess this is TODCO (THE) reinventing TODCO (THE) wheel point this is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pretty competitive route to take but for example when New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) products Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) released no body really knows how to price Gartner, Inc. (IT) efficiently Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) there is room for you to come UNOVA, Inc. (IN) and take Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stab ALLTEL Corporation (AT) pricing Gartner, Inc. (IT) better than TODCO (THE) next guy 
 liquidity constraints using your capital size to your advantage warren buffett once said if Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) had Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) million dollars Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) could Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO)  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) year and that is because Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) could take TODCO (THE) same ideas Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HE) uses and use them on lower cap stocks which Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) less efficiently priced Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) where can we go that TODCO (THE) big players cant dont try to find food UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) ocean find Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pond with lots of small fish 
 high barrier to entry due to infrastructure we cant really just go and start Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) high frequency trading firm TODCO (THE) infrastructure for this is insane Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) if you have Gartner, Inc. (IT) you could have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge 
 risk tolerance Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) we have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) higher risk tolerance than TODCO (THE) next guy and can therefore take trades  with more pnl variance that others maybe avoid cant take example Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) volatility hedge fund might not want to deploy Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strategy with  daily swings even if TODCO (THE) expected value is huge 

those Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some characteristics of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good edge idea and hopefully Gartner, Inc. (IT) gives you some ideas 

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) another post i will go into my strategy for earnings trading as Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) follow up example to this TODCO (THE) reason i American Greetings Corporation (AM) exploring earnings is because there is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of retail interest its tricky to model well and theres likely to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) variance risk premium 

 building your strategy

  pick what you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trying to predictforecast 

something really important to note is that whenever you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) placing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trade Gartner, Inc. (IT) is your opinion vs TODCO (THE) market there is somebody on TODCO (THE) other side of your trade taking on TODCO (THE) opposite view of you 

since we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trading our ideas against TODCO (THE) market Gartner, Inc. (IT) means we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) expressing Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) disagreement with TODCO (THE) markets view on things Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) whether we know Gartner, Inc. (IT) or not we have some sort of forecast or predicting on how things should BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) priced being conscious about what we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trying to predict is very important 

for example if we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trading earnings volatility what we might BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) trying to predict is TODCO (THE) straddle pnl and if we can identify when they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) cheapexpensive we can build Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strategy 

what we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trying to predict is referred to as your target variable 

 not why but whether

once we have AutoNation, Inc. (AN) idea or something we want to forecast we dont want to ask why does this exist we start by asking whether this exists 

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) many retail traders fall into this trap they Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) this sounds like Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good idea because of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) b and Citigroup, Inc. (C) reasons Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) going to trade Gartner, Inc. (IT) 

but we cant ask why Gartner, Inc. (IT) exists until we confirm whether Gartner, Inc. (IT) does 

this part usually requires some pretty serious data science skills Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) workaround for retail is to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) academic papers for ideas or surround yourself with people who have TODCO (THE) skills 

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) good place to research is 

 what should we try to predict

what we try to predict is important heres AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example to illustrate 

its hard to predict TODCO (THE) score between west ham and manchester united  AutoNation, Inc. (AN) ok team and AutoNation, Inc. (AN) allstar team but its not Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) difficult to predict who TODCO (THE) winner is likely to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) 

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) for our trading sometimes we dont need to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) trying to forecast TODCO (THE) exact move we can start by just focusing on TODCO (THE) bias

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) basic perspective if we Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trying to forecast whether Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) inflated risk premium UNOVA, Inc. (IN) its options they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) expensive we can look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) some data points that help us predict cheapexpensive Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) fair value on volatility and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reason for Gartner, Inc. (IT) but then UNOVA, Inc. (IN) our execution we can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) less married to our fair value target price and trade TODCO (THE) cheapexpensive bias more consistently 

  determine TODCO (THE) factors that help us with our prediction

imagine you Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) trying to predict TODCO (THE) amount of horsepower that Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) car Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your model TODCO (THE) target variable would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) horsepower but what can help us predict horsepower

 whether TODCO (THE) car is Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Vivendi Universal (V) or Vivendi Universal (V)
 TODCO (THE) colour of TODCO (THE) car
 rear front or Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) wheel drive
 number of doors

lets Satyam Computer Services Limited (SAY) we determine that TODCO (THE)  points above Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) good indicators of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) cars horsepower these would then become our predictor variables 

you can think of predictor variables as TODCO (THE) checklist of things we go over when trying to make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) conclusion about our target variable 

example if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) car Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Vivendi Universal (V) engine red paint rear wheel drive and  doors its probably over Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) 

 consulting TODCO (THE) data

if you want to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) professional level you will need to develop your data science skills being able to work with and manipulate data is TODCO (THE) equivalent of knowing how to type UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) professional space its not AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge but its basically expected that you know Gartner, Inc. (IT) 

UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) retail space most of us here its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) nice to have and not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) need to have Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) yes knowing Gartner, Inc. (IT) can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) advantage but its not Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) necessity 

i will focus on how to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this with no coding background unless enough traders want to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) other part 

 AutoNation, Inc. (AN) example of trading Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strategy being implemented

note Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of you ask what tools i use Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) lot of TODCO (THE) base data points and scans that i rely on Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) from predicting alpha i then use think or swim to stress and analyze positions i execute trades UNOVA, Inc. (IN) interactive brokers 

TODCO (THE) reason i use these platforms is they Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) provide me with analytics tools that ease TODCO (THE) burden of needing data science skills b let me analyze my positions UNOVA, Inc. (IN) depth before putting them on Citigroup, Inc. (C) offer me TODCO (THE) best commissions and execution on my trades

for this strategy i American Greetings Corporation (AM) sharing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) this example i American Greetings Corporation (AM) trading TODCO (THE) difference between TODCO (THE) implied and realized volatilities for us equities because of TODCO (THE) variance risk premium and increased retail interest i aim to build out Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) model that helps me identify overpriced options

 lets start by defining my target and predictor variables

 target variable realized volatility over TODCO (THE) next  days for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock

 predictor variables current realized volatility last  days current implied volatility  day current future forecast of volatility  day current ivdrvd spread

through my own research and things iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned TODCO (THE) set of predictor variables i listed above Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) good ALLTEL Corporation (AT) telling me about what realized volatility will look like over next  days

for each of those factors i American Greetings Corporation (AM) trying to determine if they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) high or Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) relative to TODCO (THE) historic metrics except for TODCO (THE) volatility forecast which is something Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit different basically Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) statistical forecast of TODCO (THE) future 

beyond each of these factors i will look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) news to add Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) more qualitative component to my analysis i want to understand why i American Greetings Corporation (AM) seeing what i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) 

  start with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) scan

i started by running Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) scan for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) stock that had some liquidity and AutoNation, Inc. (AN) iv  forecast by ALLTEL Corporation (AT) least USX Corporation (X) i also added Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) filter for iv to Gaylord Entertainment Company (GET) rid of stocks that werent implying much to happen

TODCO (THE) reason i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) this is that TODCO (THE) market Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) way too many things to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) and its efficient to use Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) scanner to filter from s of equities down to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) shortlist of things that meet Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) base criteria for your strategy 



xb

by doing Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i generated Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) list of  stocks to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) given TODCO (THE) time of year most of these stocks have earnings around  days from now Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i had to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) careful to avoid ones with big earnings moves priced UNOVA, Inc. (IN) since i American Greetings Corporation (AM) really trying to trade TODCO (THE) non event volatility most of these stocks have Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit of earnings vol priced UNOVA, Inc. (IN) on TODCO (THE) DTE Energy Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DTE) options

TODCO (THE) stock i chose for this analysis is grpn groupon 

  evaluate your predictor variables

iv rv and forecast  analysis

iv  

rv  

fv  

iv is over USX Corporation (X) fv this is my expensive indicator for TODCO (THE) fv predictor variable

off TODCO (THE) bat this is looking good iv much higher than rv and forecast this is usually Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) strong sign for sell options

to move on lets plot TODCO (THE) historic iv and rv to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) how they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) moving relative to each other 



if we plot TODCO (THE) historic iv and rv we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that for TODCO (THE) last while there Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) consistent premium of iv over rv this is my expensive indicator for iv and rv

one cause for concern we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that iv Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) continued to rise despite TODCO (THE) lower realized volatility which means that someone is still Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) buyer ALLTEL Corporation (AT) these levels and could BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) slight cause for concern i would definitely want to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) somme digging into TODCO (THE) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) to Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) whats happening around Gartner, Inc. (IT) and try to hypothesize about who could BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) buying here 

one last point we will look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) here is if this ratio between iv and rv is normal or if its ALLTEL Corporation (AT) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) extreme 

as i described UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) previous  think of iv and rv as being UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) dance together they take turns leading TODCO (THE) dance but they try to stay UNOVA, Inc. (IN) step with each other

Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) looking ALLTEL Corporation (AT) how they move together we usually Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) Gartner, Inc. (IT) mean reverts around Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) comfortable spread between TODCO (THE) two if one strays too far from TODCO (THE) other they move closer together if they move too close together they push further apart

 here is TODCO (THE) iv  rv ratio for grpn over TODCO (THE) last year



as we can Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) TODCO (THE) ivrv spread is towards TODCO (THE) top of TODCO (THE) range meaning they Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) far apart right now Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) we can expect either rv to pick up or iv to come down or them to meet UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) middle theres other combinations of possibilities but lets keep Gartner, Inc. (IT) simple

if we look back ALLTEL Corporation (AT) TODCO (THE) first graph we Sealed Air Corporation (SEE) that rv Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) remained TODCO (THE) same while iv Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) been moving up Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i could conclude that perhaps Gartner, Inc. (IT) will meet somewhere UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) middle iv comes down Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit rv goes up Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) bit but below TODCO (THE) current iv line this is my expensive indicator for ivrv ratio predictor variable

 if we look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) TODCO (THE) variables they check TODCO (THE) boxes for TODCO (THE) realized volatility to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) lower than TODCO (THE) implied aka iv is expensive 

now as mentioned theres some qualitative research into TODCO (THE) news sentiment whos trading this to really build some qualitative confidence too but assuming that checks out i would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) selling options here

 from here i would put on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) trade that properly express my view that volatility is expensive maybe Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) straddle 

i will go more UNOVA, Inc. (IN) depth on structuring and managing trades UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) later post its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) whole topic on its own

 these Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) TODCO (THE) basics of good strategy development and finding AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge UNOVA, Inc. (IN) trading 

i hope that this post Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) given you some ideas and insights into TODCO (THE) world of profitable trading Gartner, Inc. (IT) might seem like over kill but i promise that i Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) not go out of my way to to make things complicated we actually want things to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) as simple as can BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) while still being profitable 

AutoNation, Inc. (AN) important thing to note is that you can actually Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Allstate Corporation (TODCO (THE)) (ALL) of this work and still lose money trading its Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) tough game we need to always BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) improving looking for New Century Financial Corp. (NEW) ideas always on TODCO (THE) hunt for that better edge 

 if you found this post valuable please upvote Gartner, Inc. (IT) as that gives me ideas about what i should write about UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my next post 

happy trading everyone

AGCO Corporation (AG)",556,havent read your post yet but honestly thank you for these post i will read later,"American Greetings Corporation (AM) finding that my edge is

 having patient capital no itch to buy or sell until TODCO (THE) right opp comes along
 long term horizon i can hold  yrs easy
 never borrow on margin i can stomach correction w zero pressure to sell","i think youre missing one thing UNOVA, Inc. (IN) your list of categories for AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge which is industry knowledge  Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) extremely techheavy UNOVA, Inc. (IN) my portfolio and have been for years however iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) made some huge gains by getting UNOVA, Inc. (IN) to companies early on because i work UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Techne Corporation (TECH) Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i know Gartner, Inc. (IT) better than most people  i know why aws is winning UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) cloud space because i use Gartner, Inc. (IT) every day  i can usually tell if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Techne Corporation (TECH) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) is going to BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) successful longterm based on their products too  for example i saw Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) demo of ddogs product ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) conference before they even went public and i could tell instantly that this thing was pure Randgold Resources Limited (GOLD) since Gartner, Inc. (IT) could answer questions that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) struggled with solving for TODCO (THE) previous  years of my career and was even capable of doing something UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) security field not their intended purpose that i had only theorized was possible but i knew would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) invaluable once everyone else realized this i pointed Gartner, Inc. (IT) out to TODCO (THE) guy doing TODCO (THE) demo as well and TODCO (THE) use case had never even occurred to him  i know what brands of cpus my peers ALLTEL Corporation (AT) other similar companies Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) buying for their highperformance computing clusters and why plus TODCO (THE) drives networking gizmos etc and theres Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) reason that Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) jacked almost to TODCO (THE) tits about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) going forward along with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) few other companies  finally if hashicorp ever goes public i will you only live once that shit Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) hard that even wsb will BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) impressed because their products Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) some of TODCO (THE) best that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) ever used and i think almost everyone UNOVA, Inc. (IN) TODCO (THE) industry would probably agree with me  


now some of this probably falls under network as you mentioned since i certainly leverage TODCO (THE) opinions of my peers UNOVA, Inc. (IN) Techne Corporation (TECH) when making some of these decisions  however trading companies UNOVA, Inc. (IN) AutoNation, Inc. (AN) industry that you intimately understand is definitely AutoNation, Inc. (AN) edge and Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) served me well for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) very long time  sure there Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) big firms out there that will Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) their E.I. du Pont Deere & Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DE) Nemours and Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (DD) and have quants with decades of experience to actually Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO) Gartner, Inc. (IT) but even then TODCO (THE) quants Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE) going to ask people like me about Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) companys products and i can guarantee that one of their quants wouldnt BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) able to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) ddog and have their eyes light up during their demo because they can finally give me Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) solution that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) wished i had for TODCO (THE) previous  years  i realize that Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) also glossing over things like revenue and how Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) is run overall here and UNOVA, Inc. (IN) reality i can still take those things into account to Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) certain extent  its not too hard to look ALLTEL Corporation (AT) Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) smaller Techne Corporation (TECH) Molson Coors Brewing (Company) and determine if theyre going to crash and burn because they cant run Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) Molson Coors Brewing (Company)  i cant tell if theyll succeed UNOVA, Inc. (IN) general but i can definitely tell if they wont based on how they run their dev process this seems like Gartner, Inc. (IT) would BEARINGPOINT INC (BE) difficult to determine but UNOVA, Inc. (IN) reality iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found that i can usually make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pretty good guess and iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) never been wrong before Southern Molson Coors Brewing (Company) (TODCO (THE)) (SO) i think that along with TODCO (THE) usefulness of their offerings is enough to make Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A) pretty good case UNOVA, Inc. (IN) terms of fundamentals"
