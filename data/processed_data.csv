options market,investing,Goldman Says Options Market Pushing Election Risk to December,"option traders are tempering bets that volatility will spike in the stock market immediately after the us election instead theyre boosting wagers that price swings will stay elevated at least one month after the vote according to strategists at goldman sachs group inc

options on the sp  pointed to a  move on nov  the day after the presidential vote down from an implied  swing seen in august according to the banks analysis whats also shifting is the curve in futures tied to the cboe volatility index

specifically vixs november contracts which refer to volatility during the month through dec  have jumped above october ones for the first time this year a sign that traders are adding protections well beyond election day said goldman strategists led by ben snider

option markets seem to have abandoned the view that volatility would rise strongly in the leadup to the election which had been priced in throughout much of  the strategists wrote in a note to clients instead currently markets are expecting volatility to jump at election day and then remain high thereafter

the focus on extended volatility may mark a change in sentiment toward election risks in early august binky chadha chief global strategist at deutsche bank warned that options traders were too sanguine positioning for a steep postelection drop in the vix

potential delay

the latest shift in volatility pricing reflects the potential for delays in counting ballots and for results to be disputed according to goldman a key date during the process is dec  known as a safe harbor deadline for when states have to resolve any controversies related to the appointment of their electors to the electoral college and Swiss Exchange (SIX) days before electors cast final votes on dec  to determine the outcome

in  the contested george bushal gore election results were decided on dec  after the supreme court ended a florida vote recount ahead of the electoral deadline republicans have floated a bill that seeks to extend the safe harbor and electoral college meeting into january

the level of implied volatility sends a clear message the election matters for equities and the outcome is highly uncertain snider said
one industry  health care  appears particularly shielded from the turmoil with developments in the race for covid vaccines at the top of investors minds health care appears to be more buffered against broader market volatility than any other sector save industrials according to goldman

october vix futures which expire before election day but are priced off options that include election day have less upside than the november future they wrote adding that november vix optionality should be more valuable than october vix options and recommends trades in vix option calendars
this is how goldman suggests investors brace for the turmoil

sell vix oct  puts and buy nov  puts for  per contract versus reference prices of the oct future of  and the nov future of 

for investors wanting to hedge they recommend selling vix oct  calls and buying nov  calls for  per contract

source article from bloomberg",52,ignore or fade goldman noise always  forever,"i agree  the election day will last a month there will be uncertainty and chaos among us citizens when no clear winner is decided day after day

the market will not know where to go so there will be a flight to safe havens i am hedging with gold miners and digitalkoins also moving to cash in late octiber after i let my current positions run for about a month 

good luck all if i were more knowledgable i would buy vix calls for dec and sell vix puts for october and november","the level of implied volatility sends a clear message the election matters for equities and the outcome is highly uncertain snider said one industry  health care  appears particularly shielded from the turmoil with developments in the race for covid vaccines at the top of investors minds health care appears to be more buffered against broader market volatility than any other sector save industrials according to goldman

options market,investing,SoftBank unmasked as ‘Nasdaq whale’ that stoked tech rally - Financial Times,"xb

softbank is the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) whale that has bought billions of dollars worth of us equity derivatives in a move that stoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks before a sharp pullback on thursday according to people familiar with the matter

the japanese conglomerate has been snapping up options in tech stocks during the past month in huge amounts contributing to the largest trading volumes in contracts linked to individual companies in at least  years these people said one banker described it as a dangerous bet

the aggressive move into the options market marks a new chapter for the investment powerhouse which in recent years has made huge bets on privately held technology startups through its Banta Corporation (BN) vision fund after the coronavirus market tumult hit those bets hard the company established an asset management unit for public investments using capital contributed by its founder masayoshi son

now it has also made a splash in trading derivatives linked to some of those new investments which has shocked market veterans these are some of the biggest trades iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen in  years of doing this said one derivativesfocused us hedge fund manager the flow is huge

the surge in purchases of call options  derivatives that give the user the right to buy a stock at a preagreed price  has been the talk of wall street in recent weeks as the sheer size of the trades appears to have exacerbated a meltup in many big technology stocks over the summer shares in tesla soared  per cent in under a week to september  while amazon and google parent alphabet gained about  per cent

one person familiar with softbanks trades said it was gobbling up options on a scale that was even making some people within the organisation nervous people are caught with their pants down massively short this can continue the whale is still hungry

the options boom means that the us stock market remains vulnerable to further bursts of volatility according to charlie mcelligott a strategist at nomura the street is still very much in a dangerous space and that flow is still out there he said in a note on friday adding that this leaves the market open to swings higher or lower

the overall nominal value of calls traded on individual us stocks has averaged Banta Corporation (BN) a day over the past two weeks according to goldman sachs that is more than triple the rolling average in  to  the retail trading boom has played a big part of the frenzy but investors say the size of many recent option purchases are far too big to be retaildriven",736,so softbank is rwsb,"as of time of posting

stocks,investing,Best stocks to fight inflation,"we all know inflation is real and its here to stay for the foreseeable future as inflation picks up we already know the fed will have to increase interest rates the question is  how do we invest with this in mind iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been questioning this for months now 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) heard two theories the first states that inflation is no real concern for the stock market in general in fact it states its actually good for the stock market 

the second theory states that as inflation rises there tends to be an inverse relationship to stock market growth and specifically company pe ratios growth stocks tend to lose ground as pe ratios come back down to earth 

i tend to believe the second theory as it makes more sense to me low interest rates and easy money for the past decade have fueled a magnificent bull run as rates go up and money tightens i believe well likely see a pullback or correction in the market to what extent i do not know 

so what do we do with this information which stocks or sectors do well during inflationary increases from my research its been energy oil commodities and gold will this trend prove to be true once again

stocks,investing,Buying stocks that dipped 80/90% months after IPO (exponential decay curve),"i noticed that there are many small companies that lose about  weeksmonths after ipo following an exponential decay curve the price then almost stabilize for pretty long time around lets say for example  without having particular strong drawdowns

 what are the chances that buying stocks of such companies  when their price reached this sort of stabilization and very low prices and mkt cap  you will face an increase in price if the company is considered not extremely so bad bad bad from its financials

 why do the prices of these stocks usually plummet so suddenly even though experienced institutions have determined that the value of that company should be for example  times higher

 if someone really wants to invest in such a small company small cap no history low volume limited financials is this the correct time to open a long position or is better to just dont consider at all stocks that lost  in few months from ipo

edit wow thanks for the up votes everyone its been fun reading the comments adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in monthly contributions are at  a month now but in the early years they were less when i first started it was  a month and i worked my way up from there there was a good chunk of time where they were between  a month these accounts were set up on my own no employer match im not sure what my lifetime performance is but the last three years im up  overall all that in mind i can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains 

investments have been all individual stocks that i typically hold for a year or longer i pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors this is more risky than etfs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance i try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction however i also like to buy at a discount price i keep my eyes on charts and when theres opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices i jump on it theres really nothing super special to it not going to share my current exact portfolio but stocks i have owned in the past or currently include Apple Computer, Inc.

year,investing,My 12 year old would like to begin investing in the stock market. What is the best way to go about this? What type of account would you advise I open?,"as the title says  my  year old would like to begin investing his money i think it could be a very good learning experience initially i though i would just open a custodial taxable joint Toronto Dominion Bank (The) (TD) ameritrade acct when i started researching different accounts i began to this about tax advantaged accounts 

i am starting from scratch it appears s are not exactly what i am looking for in this situation as the have only mutual fund options correct me if im wrong  im in tn 

custodial roth requires a child tax form proving income of said child is this easy enough for a good accountant would it be worth it for small amount of money

should i just open a taxable custodial account for he and i 

thanks for any insight",0,not sure what the best answer is here regarding the best type of account but kudos to your son for his interest at such a young age and you as a parent getting him started early in learning how to invest if he likes reading you also should consider buying him some books on stock analysis i wish my parents did this for me when i was  then again i was probably more interested in playing nintendo,i would set him up with a demoa account and give him goals with certain parameters such as  demo account and he cant lose more than  in a day and  overall within  days see how he does reward will be  if he can do it make him pay you  per challene essentially become a prop firm for him,my age is put in my piggy bank my son had a bank account now some one at same age want to invest Gamestop Corporation (GME)

 a violation of the consent decree could carry a penalty of  per violation",1589,"last week buy the fb dip

now fuuuuuuuuuck",milling americans had their data breached by equifax nothing happened to them and nobody gave a shit a month later that data was a lot more sensitive then the data facebook stores in might be a good time to get out of fb for a bit but over the long term they aint going anywhere as they have no competition,"i wish the media would stop calling this a data breach nothing was breached security wasnt compromised facebook willingly made this data available to companies

the problem was that the companies used it in a way that violated fbs policies but there were no controls in place to prevent that from happening and there was no way for them to detect it

i own a small amount of the stock and am trying to reason the pros and cons of selling vs waiting

does the  disparity represent the risk that the buyout might not go through if not what reasons might there be for the price difference the convenience of receiving the capital  quarter early",73,"the market has decided that the  difference is the potential risk that the deal doesnt happen  


this is quite normal twitter for example was sitting at around  for quite some time before the deal officially closed at   


in the final days before the buyout it closed the gap","you are correct on both counts typically the discount is due to risk the deal falls through this could be due to unexpected financial situation on the part of either company or due to a regulatory problem such as the government blocking a deal due to antitrust monopoly concerns deals fall through sometimes its just something that happens 

a small portion is probably related to the issue of having capital tied up for x months knowing it will never exceed the deal price","risk premium and time value of money you can model it in a manner analogous to options premium 

if this interests you id suggest you look at pricing data of any acquisition pricing can actually go above the buyout if the market thinks the buy out is undervalued very rare if you want to research it look up acquisition arbitrage its not arbitrage in the strict definition the arbitrage is in the final moments of trading before the deal closes and the shares pay out but that is how it is often referred to there are entire investment funds dedicated to this strategy"
stock price,investing,How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?,"how on earth is citis stock price so low

is there a stock as ridiculously underpriced as citi c before the  crisis citi was trading at around share and then abruptly crashed down to prices as low as share before moderately rebounding to around share in late  since  citi has been trading within the range of share despite enormous growth in the companys financials citi currently trades at roughly share despite yielding annual free cash flows fcfs which are far far far greater than they ever did when its stock price was roughly share they had fcfs of  billion in  and the  q report makes the rest of the year look extremely promising if you took their q  net income extrapolated that figure for the entirety of  by multiplying it by  and assumed the same net incomefree cash flow ratio as seen in  youd get a fcf number equal to around  billion both their actual  fcf figure and this  estimate are drastic improvements from prior years but keep in mind that this backoftheenvelope estimation calculation is most likely an underestimation for one big reason

rising interest rates

banks make more money when interest rates rise the fed is raising and will continue to raise interest rates to recent records to combat the recent bout of inflation banks such as citi stand to gain enormously from this

yet for some reason the feds announcement of interest rate hikes in march barely had an effect on citis stock

edit additionally warren buffett recently invested an enormous amount in citi but that had very little effect on its stock price

every single dcf model iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen of citi yield equityshare values that are far far far higher than what the stock is currently trading for analysts widely seem to agree that citi is undervalued and has been for several years

just for fun i took the free cash flows generated by citi from  and used the excel forecast function to use that data to create a forecast for the next  years within a  confidence interval thereafter i took those fcf forecasts and used the terminal value method to come up with a npv enterprise value for the company assuming a  wacc as calculated by valueinvestingio i took this figure and subtracted the companys net debt to arrive at an equity value for the company afterward i divided this equity value and divided it by citis shares outstanding this is essentially how dcf models calculate a stocks intrinsic price i got an intrinsic price of share

but thats not all i also did the same thing but used the fcf forecasts from the lower confidence bound meaning excel is  sure that the actual values will be higher than these values thereafter i averaged the results from the median forecast and the worstcase scenario as it is extremely unlikely that citi will actually yield fcf of around  billion for every single year for the next  years averaging the median forecasts and the worstcase forecasts i got an intrinsic price of share keep in mind that this is basically the most realistic worstcase scenario for citis future fcfs

citi is currently trading at share

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) done tons of dcf models and my intrinsic value figure always ends up being pretty close to the actual stock price this is virtually the only exception how on earth is citi only trading at share how is that even possible why isnt the stock price soaring",273,what cash flow exactly are you discounting here cash flow is their operational business  you cant value a bank like that,"you shouldnt use dcf to find the intrinsic value of banks banks are highly levered and figuring out the proper fcf to use is a nightmare enterprise values should not be used to value commercial banks either as a large cash balance might even leave some with a negative Eaton Vance Corporation (EV)

before i get into mondays action a couple of things

i wanted to first give a shout out to upiddlesthethug for capturing  which shows that moment in time i referenced in my  where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the  january  calls  i added it into the post with an edit but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it  i guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of k rather than k as i wrote in the post  brutal

people have also asked me where i stand on this trade  i was lucky to get in early trade some momentum and retain a sizeable core holding relative to my play account  as iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) mentioned some comments my core holding which i will hold until this saga plays itself out would buy me a new car all cash  though after today id have to downgrade from a lower end lexus to a corolla laugh out loud

alright so todays action

i have to admit that i was just glancing at the chart between writing emails working on excel spreadsheets conference calls and meetings  whenever i could i was listening to cnbc in the background and taking a closer look whenever i heard anything that might move sentiment or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week

in my opinion the price action played out almost bythenumbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as i laid out in my previous post  i want to be clear however that while it was consistent with what i laid out liquidity drying up trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points you could reasonably interpret it other ways  as i mentioned in at least one comment seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct  it just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far  always keep that in mind

i tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as i got notifications on my phone  just as a heads up i wont always be able to do so and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway  as iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) said in comments on my previous posts i am definitely not the smartest person in the room so dont just take my word for it just because im the original poster  please challenge anything i say if you feel im mistaken and dont dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint

one thing i thought i noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price which i interpret as a good sign  downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a lowvolume vacuum  the most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open  tons of volume to push the price down then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up  this means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push resulting in gaps to the upside on the followon buying  there were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover but as i explained low price doesnt help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume  that sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying whether by shorts or longs is driving price tells you that there isnt much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices  from a higher level view volume through the day dropped as price dropped and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day

there was some very strange aftermarket volume  no idea what that may have been other than maybe hedge unwinding as t contract settlement outcomes were determined  it seemed at least to me to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass  it would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours

i got messages that i was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples money  my sentiment analysis kpis thus indicate im likely striking a healthy balance laugh out loud

 the game theory

ok but seriously is this situation a pump and dump

possibly

i say possibly because as i stated in a comment a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier  even worse in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side  not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the startits just what ends up happening if the campaign fails

ok so failure aside what are the dynamics of the trade  what kind of game is this

in simplified terms id describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified  where the winning side also takes the losing sides bid money  in other words at an aggregate level its winner take all go hard or go home with all the excitement of market action in the middle  note that i said in aggregate and with market action in the middle as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end  as i mentioned in some comments where i urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money this is going to be a whiteknuckle trade to the very end

 power

for most of our lives most of the time the saying that information is power and the closely related knowledge is power are abstract philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy  more tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be money is power or for the least fortunate the threat and reality of physical force

today for many in the Gamestop Corporation (GME) trade that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance  what is current si  can you trust numbers from s  what about ortex  are there counterfeit shares in play  what is the significance of failures to deliver can the short side cover their position off the exchange etc etc

being in this situation if nothing else has lifted the veil for many people  the right information in the right circumstances is incredibly powerful  it outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry

if you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated  most of all try to avoid developing a  at all costs  if nothing else in my opinion its critical for your longterm financial success

i dont know the answer to those questions definitively and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything i write  in fact it would make me happier if i see people use some of the tools techniques and concepts iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking  catching my mistakes helps me  doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone

 faith conviction calculated risk

many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies

some people including those that most wall street types consider to be responsible investors invest on blind faith  you put your capital is someone elses hands hopefully a qualified fiduciary and trust that they will do a good job  the only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the persons in which to place your faith  this is not entirely unlike what many wsbettors are doing with respect to dfv  i do this with my retirement accounts though lately iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a selfdirected ira

others trade on conviction  they have for whatever reason a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light  i consider value investors to fall into this category

others are momentum traders and technical analysts who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity  these opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis  all that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk

i think its healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches  i personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches midtrade  ie if you started in the Gamestop Corporation (GME) trade on faith it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the nomans land between faith and conviction where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out  im not saying you shouldnt try to make that transitionjust try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions

 swimming in the deep

so the consistent  question i always get what happens next  my consistent answer which i know frustrates everyone is i dont know and no one else does either

one person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth which some may find disturbing is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the drivers seat  this may very well be true  i would give it better than even odds at this point  in fact even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade retail is not a wellorganized monolithic entity and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times

another question i got which was a very good one to be asking is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side  for me there have been critical actions over the past few days that i would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors such as the sustained hft duel into the close on friday  that was very consistent relatively well controlled and sustained push on volume of mio shares traded in the   share price range  oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of Banta Corporation (BN) in capital flow  that is not retailparticularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time  the mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze and ortex reported reduction in short interest is also definitely not retail  others have pointed out massive action in the options today  tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high  figures  not retail

all of that being said does that really change very much  even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows i do which is why im writing these posts and holding that core position in the end you are trading as an individual  this is a point that i have made repeatedly  in the end you need to know yourself know your trade and have a plan  your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else i know many are following dfv to whatever the end may be but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual

if my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes and price grinding down to a floor of harder support possibly even at the retail line of support  i outlined in a prior post  there may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract t settlement impact  i dont know enough about what to expect there  if the squeeze is to happen unless rh lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while maybe days maybe longer until sufficient liquid float has been locked up

right now options action is heavily weighted to puts so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price

if the squeeze fails to happen there wont be a siren ringing of a bell or anything like that  it might happen gradually and nonobviously until suddenly as only the market seems to be able to do it becomes obvious that whoevers still there has been left holding the bag  hopefully this isnt the case but if it is ill be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car laugh out loud

if it succeeds it should be fairly obvious  just dont forget to ring the register

either way this is market history in the making  as i said in a previous comment when you ride the rocket its definitely not going to be smoothbut it might just be awesome

apologies for the lengthy post again  good luck in the market",3836,"i have a question while i wait to read this post this may be a stupid question im a long term investor and never pay attention to stuff like this so if im understanding the situation here correctly reported si is down from over  to  according to ortex and s over the weekend people are unconvinced as there is not enough volume for the shorts to cover in that time and shouldnt the price move up instead of down if theyre buying hard to get stocks institutional investors hold a large amount of the stock so could the shorts in theory cut a deal with the long institutional investors to cover at a more reasonable rate if thats possible would the market volume reflect that deal

if you believe in any way that the value of a stock is correlated to the underlying revenue and assets of a company which it should then it makes perfect sense that the market goes down not only because of panic sell but realistically there will be months with no revenue or negative revenue for a lot of companies so their value as a multiple of that has to reflect that

yes things will bounce back again of course and it will go back to normal but it will not make up for  months or so when people didnt use the companies services like if people dont go to cinema for  months because of fear of virus they wont say after its done ok now we go  times per week to cinema to make up for how much we missed theyll just resume going to cinema regularly those of quarters of revenue with missed losses will be forever negative on a company books"

so i recently inherited some money its about  in an ira account its  cash and i plan on investing this year but considering the current market conditions im conflicted on my approach and strategy on one hand i could dollar cost average into the market using index funds at a rate of approx  a month for  months or i could invest it all at once diversification would be into  index funds and etfs for both ideas ofcourse 

another question what is the opinion on bonds this coming up this year because with the rising rates bonds will take a hit currently the three or four index funds and etfs i will use all track equities ideas on bond allocation  laughing my ass off but seriously",443,"financial advisor here nobody can accurately time the market so i would invest a large portion as soon as possible people have been talking about doom scenarios since  

for piece of mind id suggest investing k via a lump sum look at the vanguard  paper about lump sum vs dca to understand why and split up the other k over  months k monthly this seems like a win win situation if the market goes down youre still buying more if the market goes up that first k is already gaining some nice returns

strategy,investing,"Spreadsheet to calculate GME Exit Strategy, ROI Calculations & Breakeven Analysis","please drop an upvote andor comment if you use it took me a few hours to make this spreadsheet and i would like to help as many people as possible i see a lot of people opening and duplicating the sheet please help pay it forward

disclaimer i originally created this tool for wsb but it looks like i am muted there for some reason so i figured i would share on some other subs where people are also talking about Gamestop Corporation (GME)

this whole experience has been and will be a crazy trip but you dont want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth have an exit strategy everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance some of us can afford to you only live once away sixfigure investments while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand

your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing and how much profits you would be happy taking im not here to tell you what your strategy should be but i did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself 

xb

how to use the exit strategy planner

 note  this is for shares only im not smart enough to make this work for options

 note  the link i provided is read only so the first step is to make a copy for your own use file  make a copy

 now enter your current position provide the number of shares you have in a and your average cost basis in b these cells are highlighted in yellow your total investment will automatically calculate in c

 columns ef are the roi calculator column f tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the roi listed in column e column g tells you what your total value would be at that share price

 columns ik are your breakeven analysis which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling x number of your shares and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price you will probably want to adjust the s in column i based on how many shares you currently have in your position columns j  k will automatically update when you do

 columns mn calculate your profits at different share prices how much money will you make if you sell when Gamestop Corporation (GME) hits  what about  or  or even  these columns will tell you feel free to adjust the share prices in column m if you want but i have most of the big milestones covered

 columns pr are your exit strategy planner you will need to provide the following information  of shares if any you want to hold long term postsqueeze cell p maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing q profit amount you would be  happy cashing out with no fear of missing out of future gains r cell q will calculate your worst case scenario sell price set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses to the amount you entered in q while still holding your desired  of longterm shares cell q will calculate your best case scenario sell price set a limit order at this price to cash out with your  satisfied profit you entered in r while still holding your desired  of longterm shares

 columns Grupo Televisa S.A. (TV) is an incremental sales planner some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit ie sell  shares when it hits  another  at  etc simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point column u and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues net profit and remaining shares

too long; didn't read use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on Gamestop Corporation (GME) when all of the shorts are officially squeezed make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and riskreward preferences

of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments but lets be honest half of us seem to be all in on Gamestop Corporation (GME) right now big week ahead may all of our profits be plentiful

strategy,investing,"A story about the Dot Com bubble, some profit taking, exit strategies and money vs capital","in the late s we had a similar techdigital stock rally this is not nearly as bad though so chill companies are actually destroying the estimates and profits are strong

back then it was web page development and internet providers now its mainly electric vehicles and some parts of tech 

stnks were only going up up and up you heard things like  dude its a new economy this is the new normal this is the future you cant use old models to define value die all boomers and burn traditional stocks ok i might be exaggerating on this one 

anyway i was a finance major at a prominent university in london uk i was destined for greatness and a trainee spot at deutsche banks analyst desk my friend  lets call him eli because his name was actually eli  was a stock genius 

everybody is a genious in a bull market you put some money in to a company in it and bam the new buffett or cathie

eli was good for about kusd at one point not bad for a student or i should say kusd nominal value in stocks because its not money until you sell eli learned the hard way

the dip came eli figured stnks only go up  im gonna buy the dip the dip became a slide then a vortex and finally evolving in to a capital sucking black hole not an anus ok

eli bought and bought he also had a debt position of about  of his portfolio this increased to  the bank called hey eli  that collateral isnt so hot anymore pay up dude eli paid up one year later he had kusd on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees



so whats there to learn well depends on how risk averse you are but i see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits there is no rule or best practice but heres at least an strategy that im using myself


 i  usually dont let a stock grow beyond  of my portolio if it does i start scaling back profits and weight to other new opportunities the riskier the stock the earlier and more i scale back

compound that interest bitch

 i always keep a  cash position so i can take advantage on dips or other opportunities this capital has had a ridiculous payback over the years this is not money this is capital i have a savings account with  months salary thats money money pays bills capital grows

 for every  growth i take home for example  of the profit in riskier playa so in Gamestop Corporation (GME) for example i started buying early and by  i only had profits invested by  i had sold about  and on the way down i dropped the last stocks at  

so lets say a stock grows from  to  i take back  then it goes to  i take back another  so now i have taken  total 

obviously there is some flexibility here but use it for inspiration for more secure stocks you want to hold on more and longer but for me its a lot about maintaining that cash position


so what do i do with my profits well i do a few things 


 i reinvest them in to other stocks so i make sure i have a short list of alternatives at all times  for example my Gamestop Corporation (GME) winnings yes it was a casino paid for  paypal stocks at  theyre now up  

compound that interest bitch


 i put them in the cash position so i can be opportunistic but still max  life saver in march pure rocket fuel baby 


 i buy my wife or kids presents i get a nice rolex or refurbish the house  i turn it in to money i have money so i can spend it use it 



moral of the story or too long; didn't read

make money you probably wont see another opportunity like the one of the past  months its not coming back for a while 

dont step out of the market pick your stocks wisely keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing earning calls or dips and remember it is not money until you sell

disclaimer  i was a licensed financial advisor as in a securities analyst but do your own research this is not advice its inspiration

ps eli went on to be a very successful entrepreneur and has started a few companies i believe one of them is going to ipo soon ds

strategy,investing,What is your strategy for the coming rising interest rate environment?,"i am a fairly new investor i began in  it has obviously been a stellar few years did covid even happen

i have a close relationship with an old professor of mine he has a doctorate in finance and has amassed serious wealth who teaches investments at the college level we often chat he was a derivatives trader for  years back in the s and s

he swears and insists that when rates begin to rise the market is going to absolutely eat shit and most if not all valuations will drop he says that the market has been hooked on the feds liquidity since  and the withdrawals will be severe he has been slowly divesting the past few months

i see where he is coming from and he is obviously much wiser than me in class he would always preach about if a stock falls  you need  gain to make your money back therefore avoiding downside is much better than missing a little upside which i also agree with

what i am not so sure of is that rising rates will spell doom for the markets the most i could see is maybe slowed growth but if rates steadily climb to around  on the  year that would actually be good for the economy

thoughts on this inb long term time horizon i never sell

edit following up due to traction this guys worst year was  where he made  which still massively outperformed the market i understand the never sell mentality but look at the facts rates are at rock bottom qe is off the charts there is literally only one direction the fed can go i predict rates will begin to rise slowly at some point next year if you had a chance to miss massive downside would you take it can you use logic to make prudent investment decisions or are you locked into never mitigating risk i am actually beginning to consider slowly exiting the risks are starting to compound significantly

first as has been said in other replies  its always a good time to invest in the market for the long term broad market index funds are like investing directly into capitalism which generally always wins in the long term if the market is below current levels in  years theres so much else wrong in the world your retirement fund is the least of your concern

secondly the markets are down a fair amount right now the sp  is about  off its all time high granted it went lower than that recently and historical has gone much lower in various crisis but even if you bought today and it went down further youve already locked in a pretty good discount buying in recessions even if not all at the very bottom almost always ends up a pretty good deal for the investor in the long run so i wouldnt be worried if we havent seen the bottom yet maybe we have maybe we havent but to lock in a  off sale today is pretty hard to beat

im trying to determine how much to invest each period in a longterm hold strategy specifically im trying to make guesses with a time value of money calculator as to how much my investment will be worth in a few decades for this example i assume ill receive  back on my investment per year on average over many years before inflation is accounted for ill also assume that inflation is  on average per year i have been viewing my investments as making  to account for the  inflation in my example 

however if i am letting money sit for a long period of time lets say  years and i invest  each month at the beginning of the period it doesnt take long before the interest earned on the principle of my investment will far outpace my expected monthly cash outflows in my overall personal budget adjusted for inflation  


does it seem proper to look at my investment as much x rate of return  y rate of inflation i ask because what boggles my mind is the point where my investments earn more interest in a period than i plan to spend in that same period i understand the idea that inflation will make a dollar in the future less valuable than a dollar today but for some reason i cant help but think that i might be missing a key concept about rate of return vs inflation  since at some point the inflation on my monthly consumptions wont keep pace with the interest earned on a large enough principal balance inflation adjusted  


i hope that this makes sense i have an accounting background and i should know the answer to this but i dont and  its been gnawing at me for awhile maybe there is a term for what im trying to ask about or maybe i have a poor understanding of time value of money and im looking at this problem incorrectly

id love to know if anyone can help i promise to pay it forward thank you for any insight that you can provide",3,technically you should divide your real return with x nominal return and y inflation is x  y   that tends to be pretty close to x  y though,deleted,"how fast is it hitting that point where interest exceeds your monthly spending compounding interest will lead to rapid growth eventually but it does take several years to get going if its happening really quickly in your calculations you might have a mistake in your yearsmonthsrates the first thing i think of is your  is an annualized rate and you would need to divide it by  to get your monthly rate of return since you mention monthly deposits if you are seeing the growth in like the  year range thats about right i forget where exactly compounding interest starts to get impressive

the reason the prevailing advice here is to just invest in index funds that represent the whole market is because of what you are seeing compounding interest when given enough time makes a huge difference in how much money you will have"

time,investing,"Anybody have any thoughts/explanations for agency bonds?

my understanding is the federal home loan banks although private are essentially a government created network or at least government sanctioned network created through the federal home loan bank act they focus on community lending mainly residential mortgages their bonds are considered agency bonds and have a rating of Asco Plc Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) (AAA) to aa during  although they took a financial hit they were strong enough so as not to require a government bailout see 

with interest rates high and only another  federal interest rate increase expected as inflation is reacting as expected current new issues of federal home loan basers are   interest rate which are available to retail through most brokers in  bond increments 

this seems like a pretty good deal buy a  year bond at what are likely high interest rates so likely an expectation that interest rates will go down from the  interest rate bonds currently being issued lock in a  yield if interest rates go down then the value of the bonds will go up as you buy them  years out so a decrease in interest rate will have more of an impact on the bond value it seems the only major downside of these bonds is that they are callable although not util july

 the influence of the british colonial legal system adds a layer of predictability to indias business environment true but the indian judiciary is overburdened and extremely slow it takes decades to resolve a case also over the years laws have been passed arbitrarily to help or punish certain corporations

 indias stable legal framework favorable for business is a significant advantage that differentiates it from other options  the legal framework is not as stable

stock market crash,investing,The paradox that the stock market on average will return 8% to 10% but will not return 8% to 10% on average.,"so i havent been on this subreddit long but but a common theme i have seen is people doing stuff like saving to buy a house in  years and wondering if they should put their down payment into the sp during those  years so they can get  to  interest another and the one that inspired me to actulay wtrite this is someone complaining that the sp is basicly the same as where it was in july of  and wondering why there hasent been a  to  profit over that time

year on year data for the sp is aviable in several places but just to pick one reference let use  lets copypaste the table here 

yearreturn

































































































years where the return was less than                                            

years where the return was more than                                                    

years where the return was exactly  to      

when parsed this way its fairly straightforward to see that when you add up all of the times it was under  and put that together with all the times it was over  that it balances out to  however actually getting the  to  is a rare occurrence happening only four times over the past century

four

this is one of those counter intuitive things about stats kind of like how if a medical test is  accurate and your test is positive that does not mean you have a  chance of having the condition or like how it can be the case that for women medicine a is better than medicine b and for men medicine a is better than medicine b but together for the population as a whole medicine b is better than medicine a its just common sense that if an average is  to  then that should mean that  to  is the most common happening but it does not work that way

i know i am shouting into the void here no matter what i say or do it is not going to stop the flow of people thinking that the sp is a sure bet to return  to  but i just had to say something to get it out of my system",1852,this is the rinvesting version of lebron averaging  over his entire career but never ended a game with,"just playing around with the numbers shown

average    median    mode  occurred x if you round the returns to nearest whole 

 there was a negative or  return  times   of those were double digit negative
 there was a positive return  times   of those were double digit positive
 consecutive years with a negative return have happened  times     and 
 longest stretch of consecutive years with a positive return was  years   consecutive years happened twice

some interesting notes to me

  of time the market will provide a positive return in a given year  of those will be double digit returns
 there is a  chance that the market will have at least one down year in every  year span  there were only Swiss Exchange (SIX) times      and  where you could put money in and go  straight years without encountering a down year
 there were  times where a  year investment would average a negative return a  chance
 only  times where a  year investment had a negative average return  chance for a positive return
 there has not been a  year period that averaged a negative return",this isnt a paradox its just how averages work
stock market crash,investing,Stop stressing about which party is better for the stock market: The data shows it doesn’t matter much,"xb

for investors worried about how the election will impact their portfolios over the long haul fear not elections have seldom had a lasting impact on equity prices

president donald trump has warned that the stock market will crash if former vice president joe biden wins the  some market experts have also raised concern about the potential for a blue wave if democrats gain a majority in the senate win the white house and keep control of the house

however history shows that stocks usually do well regardless of which party controls the white house or congress 

i think people overestimate the importance of politics for investing said david kelly chief global strategist at Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (JP) morgan asset management 

 are republicans or democrats better for stocks 

data over the past  years shows that party control over either chamber has relatively little to do with longterm changes in the broad sp  stock index

starting in  the numbers indicate that republican and democratic majorities in the house and senate have had little impact on stock prices in the two years following an election 

the same holds true when you look at the number of party seats gained or lost in the house and senate against stock prices in the sp  during that period 

the data yields similar results for the november to november cycle which is a gauge of market sentiment to the election as well as january to january which shows the actual market performance of the congress 

 presidents and stocks 

where you start to see more of an impact is the combination of party control in both chambers of congress 

data compiled by LG.PHILIPS (LPL) financial shows that beginning in  the average annual stock return was  under a split congress  when republicans held both chambers and  when democrats had control

LG.PHILIPS (LPL) financials ryan detrick said in a note that markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesnt have too much sway hence the stronger stock performance during a split congress

but when you broaden it out even further to consider the party of the president in tandem with party control of the two chambers the trend of a split congress being best for stocks doesnt always hold true 

sam stovall cfra chief investment strategist looked at how the market has performed under Swiss Exchange (SIX) political scenarios a white house and congress all under the same party a white house with a split congress and a white house and congress hailing from two different parties stovall included election data going back to 

of all the possible combinations stocks appear to perform best when a democrat is in the white house and the congress is split the second highest returns happen when a democrat is president and republicans control the congress

 

but ultimately stovall said investors should be wary of reading too much into these numbers 

its a good example of how you can have data tell whatever story you want he said if you want to favor the democrats talk about the presidency if you want to favor the republicans talk about house control  


bob french director of investment analysis at mclean asset management agrees we can go in and slice and dice the data however we want and most of the time come up with whatever answer we want

stock market crash,investing,The reason why the stock market ALWAYS is over valued.,"i know that to figure out whether the broad market is over valued is gdp to the diff indexs wilshire  sp etc  when you do that the market always seems too high  im guessing its because people today dont know what the hell to do w their extra   they can buy a second house they can buy bonds but really other than the stock market thats about it

my grandpa  and his friends arewere terrified of the stock market nobody older than the baby boomers would put their  anywhere near that thing they were even a bit afraid of banks   they would buy real estate or even freezers full of fish and drums of heating oil cans of food but never stocks  im guessing this is why the stock market valuations blew up more than anything else in the last  years people now have less fear of the markets and they need somewhere to invest 

what do you think",44,"about  of us adults invest in stocks according to various websites and i highly doubt most of those investors are dumping in a good chunk of their paycheck considering how many love to spend 

i think that more people than ever are investing in stocks but its definitely not everyone and probably a minority of investors are making good decisions allocation not going into debt etc",i think market to gdp is a bad indicator of market valuation and i think you are misusing the word overvalued to mean fairly valued but with a higher multiple than before,"i think you are  correct but i think that the cycle will repeat itself eventually high valuations  lower returns and higher risk of multiple compression  jaded stock market investors  higher risk aversion and then lower valuations as money flows out of stocks the lower valuations will lead to higher returns and happier investors

only problem is what is the time scale of this cycle waiting it out might not be a reasonable option at this point in time"
stock market crash,investing,Why is simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing the last 3 decades of stock market data to find the best DCA strategy,"by now we have all heard the virtues of dollarcost averaging dca and that you should never try to time the market basically it has been repeated ad nauseam that

time in the market beats timing the market

but what is interesting is that i could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollarcost averaging

theoretically there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hardearned money once a month into spy right

so in this weeks analysis we will explore various methods to do dca and see which one would end up giving you the best returns

 

analysis

given that dollarcost averaging is about holding investments longterm we need data lots and lots of data for this i have pulled the adjusted daily closing price  shiller pe ratio of spy for the last  years 

now we have to devise different methods to do the dollarcost averaging that will maximize our longterm return we will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles all of them would be investing the same amount   every month but following different strategies

average joe invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending this would be our benchmark

cautious charlie invests in the market only if the price to earnings ratio  is lesser than the last year rolling average else will hold treasurybills 

balanced barry invests in the market only if the price to earnings ratio is within   of the last year rolling average else will hold tbills

analyst alan invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last alltime high else will hold tbills 

given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment i have considered the starting point to be st jan  so the analysis is based on someone who invested  every month since  in all the above strategies we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied ie in the case of cautious charlie he will keep on accumulating tbills every month if the pe ratio is not within his set limit once its below the limit he will convert all the tbills and invest them into spy 



results

based on the time period of our analysis we would have invested a total amount of  till now

return comparison  different dca strategies 

investment strategyportfolio investment strategy

average joe
analyst alan   drop
analyst alan   drop
balanced barry
analyst alan   drop
analyst alan   drop
cautious charlie

 

no matter what strategy we use the most amount of returns were made by the average joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending a close second was analyst alan who accumulated money in tbills and only invested when the market dropped more than  from its alltime high

the least amount of returns were generated by cautious charlie who only invested if the pe ratio was lesser than the last year average basically by trying to avoid overvalued rallies he ended up missing on all the gains followed by the analyst alan persona who waited for a  drop from ath before investing



limitations

there are some limitations to the analysis

a tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis both of these would adversely affect the overall returns

b since i am only using the monthly data for the pe ratio and my spy investments due to data constraints a much more complicated strategy involving intramonth price changes might have a better chance of beating the market at the same time making it more difficult to execute

c while we have analyzed the trends using the last  years worth of spy data the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say   or even  years

 

conclusion

i started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month i also checked for various time frames   years and various endpoints just before the covid crash after the crash before jpow etc in none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average joe in the total returns

since this is an optimization problem i am  in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive riskadjusted marketbeating returns

 

footnotes

 the data was obtained from yahoo finance api and longtermtrendsnet while the pe ratio was available for the last  years the daily closing of spy was limited to  years

 we are using the shiller pe ratio  this ratio divides the price of the sp  index by the average inflationadjusted earnings of the previous  years this solves for the brief period in  when the normal pe ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis

 we are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the tbonds

 the  cutoff is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends

 the idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (JP) morgan which stated that  of the best days in the market happened within  days of the worst ones",729,"a key takeaway while some strategy may be superior to the average joe in certain conditions anyone who is just starting out should be primarily concerned about simply getting in to the market the big deltas for outcomes will come from the time periods when your account is large so get started asap and dont sweat the details up front

as your pile of money grows youll have literal years to adjust your strategy if you think its suboptimal 

waiting is bad 

not building investing habits is bad

get in the market and let the compounding power of time work for you

good writeup","heres an explanation thats k words

because its a practical and easy way to implement buy low sell high into","excellent analysis being an average joe makes sense for someone at the start of their investing journey and it removes the psychological elements

stock market crash,investing,Are you mentally prepared for a stock market crash?,"hi all new to investing 

im just trying to figure out how people approach investing
looking at past market crashes   though not frequent and small recessions since then are you mentally prepared to lose a significant portion of your current investments should such a crash occur

i know people generally advise to keep emergency funds like m of expenses and to invest the remaining cash in index etfs but are you really mentally prepared to in worst cases lose even  of everything besides that m of emergency funds 

maybe im more risk adverse than the average investor but the daunting thought would make me only want to invest like  or even less of my possessions in the stock market and keeping way more cash than m emergency funds

often these price extensions and retracements occur for the same reason that your friend who is always  minutes late to everything was late to work yesterday  its just typical behavior

i really like buying  year treasuries they yield about  and would essentially act as the equivalent of locked for the  years at that rate rates arent going to stay high forever so locking long duration now is a great strategy in my opinion also the  year yields higher than the  year right now yeah its kind of what it is in this current market

you can do this through schwab by using the tradebonds area on the website

i like this better than short duration and general funds because those will drop in the coming years so even if you can get  in short duration now it probably will lose out to locking at  now in about  years time is my guess","inherited ira works just like a normal ira  you buy and sell what you want any interest gains and losses arent taxed as long as they sit in the account when you withdraw anything move it to another account it all gets taxed as income at that time so moving it to a hysa would be a taxable event id suggest mostly investing in index funds Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) etc tbills and cds  


remember that you may have to pull out some as a required minimum dispersal ResMed Inc. (RMD) this years may have been done before it transferred but youre responsible to know that and youre probably required to pull it all out before  years is done  


i recently figured all this out inheriting from my father in my case im working a full time job so im pulling out the bare minimum required until i retire so that i dont get taxed very much on it upon retirement my income will be significantly less so i can pull out with lower taxes in my humble opinion taxes are never the most important consideration but theyre always worth considering"
options,investing,"How to not get ruined with Options - Part 4a of 4 - Finally, the TRADES!","post a example of trades short puts covered calls and verticals





in parts  and  i explained the basics for options in parts  and  i explained simple and more advanced options strategies but all of this does not help much without concrete examples these two last posts a and  conclude my introduction related to options i will show some of my key trades explaining the why the how the entries and exits and potential mitigations in case of losses most gave great returns and i had a few small losses overall in the past few months i have been lucky to play along with the market and the high volatility had a positive impact hopefully nothing rwsb worthy although few of them might qualify  i wanted to explain the basics first then show the trades last as i did not want anyone to try to emulate these without understanding howwhy they worked

first here are the highlevel idioms that drive my investments

 over time the market is going up
 it can fall down violently or it can jump high without obvious signs ahead of time
 when the market goes down it will go back up over time and that can be very quick
 a single stock will be more volatile than the markets and can go up or down even more violently and unlike the market if it goes down there is no guarantee it will ever go back up
 after a significant market move the market often but not always reverts to the mean

these idioms are pretty straightforward and should not be too controversial overall i am pretty market neutral with a bullish tint  and as i explained before i prefer selling options than buying them my trades reflect that and i avoid making trades that could damage my portfolio significantly if the market went up or down significantly people who get ruined with options do not take this into account and are just gambling

other key things about trading in general and options in particular

 always have a clear idea of your max profit and your max loss and the probability of that to happen failing to understand this means that you will take more risk than anticipated and one day you could blow up your account and get ruined
 keep your trades small dont have a sure thing trade that risks  or more of your portfolio dont cripple your portfolio because of one bad trade
 dont trade for the sake of trading wait for the conditions to be right then wait a bit more and wait again then when things look the best then trade on your own terms do not get sucked into gambling with a poor profitrisk profile
 watch out for your leverage it can be very easy to take too many risks and use too much of your buying power if you mix your bearish and bullish bets you can close one side at a profit to free some buying power and reduce overall risk

now the moment we have been waiting for some of my trades

the short naked puts or covered calls

i only do pure covered calls when the market has dropped significantly and use the recent market conditions as a floor march dropped quite hard and i am not convinced that we would reach it again soon but i still have to prepare for it that being said the months of march to june have been really good for covered calls as the market traded up first then sideways with high implied volatility i usually target shares that are solid or did not go up too much so the march floor is not too far lower than my strike i usually sell naked puts after a few down days in a row and covered calls after a few up days in a row and if the market is farther from the floor i trade safer names when the market goes up and target high beta when the market dropped significantly

i am not giving you a full list but lets say that it was not hard and still is to find good names that return  per month after accounting for a  share drop yup you read that right it does not work in normal markets but it is the case right now even if Washington Mutual, Inc. (WM) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Intel Corporation (INTC) Commercial Net Lease Realty, Inc. (NNN) eww Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (DLTR) Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) bac etc dropped by around  i would gladly pocket my  premium and scoop these at a huge discount even if it dropped further i can continue rolling the puts until the market bounces back some of the high beta names include Carnival Corporation (CCL) Remington Oil and Gas Corporation (REM) dig bud jets xop etc for a high beta i am targeting  or more of premium but i usually try to offload them when they go up significantly

but there are few other riskier trades that are worth calling out

dkng  draftking  in  weeks

i forgot about the ipo and got in the game  days later although i am not a gambler and the stock went up already but i had a feeling that rh fams would jump on it gamblers beget gamblers and that would give a floor to the stock volatility was high so selling naked puts made sense

may  sell  dkng   may   put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

may  sell  dkng   jun   put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

as you know the max risk of going to  is possible but highly improbable so rorac return on riskadjusted capital is much higher than these  to 

the  premium was one week before expiration i sold the may and june puts at the same time and the price was at  already if the price dropped i would continue rolling my puts until i am profitable the price went up i rolled my may puts just before earnings and a day before expiration to take advantage of the earning volatility and avoiding expiration day

may  sell  dkng   may  june   put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

so one week later i bought back my may puts for  pocketing already  of the profit and sold the same june contract as the week before with a better price and an overall premium of  same as the week before despite paying back the  and the stock was already up in a week can you believe that shit volatility increase definitely helped thanks rh gamblers

june  buy  dkng   june   put  

after a bit more than  weeks of holding i decided to buy back all my contracts for  per share for an overall  profit on risk i pretty much reached max profit already no need to take more risk with  days to go to expiration fwiw the stock was at  by expiration it was way too much for my taste with no premium worth the risk of any new trade

could i have made more profit buying shares calls or synthetic shares sure but there was no guarantee on the direction timing or amplitude of the move here i won almost  with a high probability of success even if the stock barely budged or dropped a bit and since  expiration the stock dropped to  now its hard to predict when to sell i want many singles and doubles with few losses instead of once in a while home runs with many losses in between

as it dropped for  days to  i recently sold some puts for a  strike again

june  sell  dkng   aug   put  

per contract  max risk  max profit   of max risk

because the put was deep otm the premium was low the stock will have to drop by more than  for me to start losing money and i can still roll my puts then that seems a good trade wish me luck

you can see here that you have to look at your max risk your max profit for every trade you are getting into as well as the chance for them to be profitable

uso  dbo  usl  in  months

here is one that absolutely did not go to plan initially but i was able to turn it around

first the trade that led to the disaster

april  sell  may    put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

remember that uso split  on april  if you want to look at the numbers on  uso was worth  oil kept dropping and dropping for weeks and weeks until that friday where i decided that it was finally a good time to get into oil like a bunch of other suckers the lowest oil price in  years etc my trade could absorb a  loss in uso before i started losing money so it did not feel too risky and i could roll the puts if needed uso rolled all their future contracts earlier that week they were already into may futures yeah contango was a concern but seemed manageable or so i thought

well except that on monday  oil blew up what was bad became an awful day oil tanked hard because april futures dropped and some people paid to get rid of their contracts tankers started to get full too much oil and not enough space uso dropped to  it was still above my breakeven point of  but the volatility spiked so the value of my short put increased a lot that was some heavy losses why did i go into that trade on friday gosh

the volatility was so high every oil trader was running around like a headless chicken rh gamblers were taking much heavier losses than mine because they started buying uso long before me oil was going to go back up that was a sure deal right i decided to wait one more day to see how the dust would settle on tuesday uso dropped even more because now it started impacting next months future may tuesday was the april future expiration so trading was all over the place uso dropped to  well below my breakeven point volatility was still high my losses were twice as big there was a strong possibility that may future expiration would behave the same as april and the rollover of may futures to june futures would end up in a real quagmire due to an even higher contango uso was not the right tool i messed up no way moving forward even rolling my puts are not going to do it uso will drop faster than the premium i can collect get out get out get out

april  buy  may    put  

i bought back my short put at more than  times the premium price gulp that hurts

taking a step back this was an extreme situation and not a normal loss with a stupid long term thesis and i lost a bit of money jumping at the wrong time a negative future price is not a common occurrence

uso was the wrong instrument to profit from oil it even dropped down to  and never recovered its value from  despite oil being higher than that day i made a mistake but there must be better instruments that can tackle contango enters dbo and usl dbo has a  month away contract so very little impact from contango usl has the same number of contracts from all months next month month after next etc until the th month it is mostly impacted by the contango on the front months so for  of the value or a bit more but it is not as volatile as uso uso since changed their composition too to buy multiple months futures

oil blew up volatility is extremely high many oil traders and rh gamblers got ruined but oil is bound to go up eventually the initial trade to sell volatility through selling naked puts and rolling as needed until oil goes back up without being killed by the contango still seemed sound with even less risk and better rewards this time around

april  sell  dbo may    put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

april  sell  usl may    put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

april  sell  dbo may    put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

april  sell  usl may    put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

notice that i sold the first batch on april  as i was still losing money from uso the volatility spiked and it was too good to pass this is a key reason why you should never put all your money on one trade but only a few percents at most that way if the things are not going as planned you dont lose a ton and if you can find a more advantageous position you can double down if you have some dry powder left but do not overdo it its all about the proper sizing of trades and overall risk i sold the nd batch when i closed my losing uso trade when oil dropped further and volatility increased even more  to  potential profit on at the moment puts just wow

the plan for the exit is to close for  or roll to the next month for further profit i sized my dbo and usl trades a bit more than my uso trades so i would make up for the heavy losses and i did roll in may and closed the june contracts for  both dbo and usl their prices both creeped up slowly and the volatility dropped to something normal dbo and usl trades were extremely profitable and despite the heavy uso losses the overall profit was still quite good

today the price of dbo and usl is a bit high for a good profitrisk profile with naked short puts however we have some other strategies

the verticals

most of my bread and butter is on selling naked puts andor selling covered calls but sometimes i dabble in verticals here are some examples

uber  in a month

this is an example of waiting for the right time before you trade end of may the market went up by  since the bottom it started to be overextended although spy could continue higher it was time to think about a reversion to the mean i needed to find a share that would continue to struggle for a long time even as coronavirus was lingering i hear the news that lyft is taking over ubers market and that uber is still struggling with potential layoffs that seems a good candidate and uber has a good day at  lets see what we can make of the numbers

may  sell  uber jul    call  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

so i keep my  profit per contract as long as uber is under  at the july  expiration i did not pick  randomly this was actually above the top that uber reached in february so the struggling uber would need to go over its precorona numbers for me to lose money unlike naked puts  covered calls where you can just be patient and roll over and over sizing for verticals is important the potential for full losses is a real possibility and will happen sure you could try to roll your short call and hope that the stock price will drop but you may just end up amplifying your losses if you really want to do that and continue with the risk its easier to roll your short puts in a bull spread as the market will eventually go up

in any case uber continued to go up a bit struggled at  so not even close to my vertical then reversed i put an order to close my position at  as there was almost a month left until expiration and i already almost reached my max profit

june  buy  uber jul    call  

spy various

i also have been using spy verticals directly as the market bounced back like crazy i earned more than i lost and because i am overall positive delta even if i lose a bit of money on my edges i am still very profitable

for shit and giggles one trade to show how you can take advantage of the high volatility

june  sell  spy jul    call  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

june  buy  spy jul    call  

profit of  per contract  of max risk

june  spy was   higher than the bottom  months ago and i had hard time believing that after the market really thought that spy would go back to precorona level with still phase  not over no clear treatment vaccine many months away and potential for a nd wave news flash its happening before even the phase finished trees dont grow to the sky again being overall positive delta even if this vertical had a loss i would still profit from spy going over my short calls as i said earlier i am a reversion to the mean guy with a bullish tint i cant stand losing money when the market is going up because the market could always continue going back up

here is another trade not so good this time so i dont paint an overly rosy picture

may  sell  spy jun    call  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

june  buy  spy jun    call  

ouch  loss of  per contract  of max risk

spy blew way past my short and long calls it dropped a bit before expiration so i was able to avoid a full loss

my verticals above are bearish spreads when i think the market will revert to the mean but here is an example of a bullish spread

april  sell  spy dec    call  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

may  buy  spy dec    call  

profit of  per contract  of max risk

i sold the vertical a couple of weeks after the bottom with blood in the street even some of mine volatility was still very high with this trade i would have lost money if spy was less than  in more than  years heh i could even roll the puts if the short put was still itm in  years the only reason i bought back and closed the trade was that it was using a nonnegligible buying power for the next  years that is a long time to earn the full  per contract have to watch out for opportunity costs too in some other trades

the hedge

here is another construct that i found interesting again taking advantage of the current high volatility back in early june as the market bounced to  i wanted another bearish hedge but this time more efficient than just selling a vertical i wanted a good protection for my long delta but thats not free and i dont like to lose money if the hedge is not used so what to do

june  sell  spy nov    call  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

i picked november expiration because i expect that we will still be in the middle of the coronavirus quagmire  is almost  higher than the spy top i doubt that the economy will be back full speed by then again i am positive delta so if spy somehow reaches  i may have to forgo all my overall gains between  and  but i wont lose money overall and then i bought this bearish vertical

june  buy  spy nov    put  

per contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk

here i used the money from my short bearish call spread to buy a long bearish put spread as long as spy does not end above  by expiration my hedge is free if the market drops significantly my bearish put spread will be very profitable

xb

once again its a long post so thats all for today

in the second  of this post i will show how i used calendars to make some very profitable trades

i will also explain a more advanced trade that i used to hedge against big losses in a normal market setup in low volatility so you can handle more gracefully bear markets ahead of time and not sell in panic you cant use it now but it could be helpful next time everything is great and the market is getting overheated a bit

xb

and finally remember to always size your trades properly do not let one trade create a big loss in your portfolio do not overextend its way too easy to be overleveraged with options take the full risk into consideration

i wanted to chat a bit about options here i realize that there are already plenty of articles about options that you can find online but many are either overly complex oversimplified trying to sell you some products etc i figured i would explain some of it here in order to reduce the learning barrier after all knowledge is power and given the recent  with robinhood i figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood and dont end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later if you are interested in trading options i invite you to look for more details online

i have been trading options since  i made some mistakes so many especially in the beginning over the years i kinda reduced my option trading activities but these past few months i have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile which helps with my trading style

this first post is to explain how options work in general the  post will go into some more details the third posts  and  will explain some standard strategies and the fourth posts  and  will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how i approach option investing if you are looking at rwsb style of investment please skip these posts they are not for you i am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles but i will still take some calculated risks so i say  it is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard etfs  mutual funds  real estate so my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth

it is often perceived that options are extremely risky and one of the best ways to get ruined for some trades this can be true to dispel a myth in reality options can also be used to be extremely conservative even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market unlike for shares where you can only control the diversification with options you have a much bigger control on the risk  profit profile time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit or lose from

one thing to note is that not all companies or etfs provide options for their shares

the basics call and put contracts strike and exercise

options are split into two groups calls and puts both have a strike an expiration date and a number of shares attached to it well talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later when you buy a call or put option you buy a contract with a rd party through your broker and the stock market usually one contract represents  shares

the strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument so for spy that is worth  today you will have options with strike  but also    etc from  to  options strikes are created as the underlying instrument spy goes up and down for spy strikes have a granularity of  around the share price but can also be  or even  farther from the current price some other instruments have a   or even  granularity it can even have a  granularity hello hertz it dropped so much that the lowest strike is  right now

a call is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date if you buy a call with a  strike and the share price went up to reach  this allows you to buy some shares at  that are now worth  the action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call when you exercise your call contract you are buying shares into your account

remember that in most cases  contract will buy  shares in your account when exercising each call contract you will need k of cash in your account in this example  for the strike multiplied by  shares and the same  shares are now worth k at  for each share not accounting for the price you paid for the call option more on this later this means you will make a profit of k if you sell the shares

conversely a put is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date if you bought a put with a  strike and the share price went down to  this allows you to sell some shares at  that are now worth  each similarly to a call the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put

when exercising each put contract you are selling  shares from your account when exercising each contract your  shares will be sold for k  for the strike multiplied by  shares and the same  shares are now worth k at  for each share not accounting for the price you paid for the put option this means you made a profit of k if you did not have the  shares per contract in your account you would be actually short selling the shares and you could make the k profit by buying these shares back

in summary a call buys shares when exercising a put sells shares when exercising most importantly in the vast majority of the cases you should actually not exercise your contracts but instead you should sell your call or put at the market price as you will increase your profit see extrinsic value later

brokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money in other words you cant exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call you want to buy low when the value is high or current value is above the strike for a put you want to sell high when the value is low

most brokers do autoexercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised if the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date and you did not sell your contracts before they will be worthless and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost

although i am mostly talking about american style options that can be exercised at any time there are also european style options that can only be exercised at expiration in the us markets pretty much all stocks and etfs are american style but the cashsettled indexes like spx and rut are european style

the basics intrinsic and extrinsic value

a call or a put contract costs money to buy called a premium so a rd party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put after all they wont take the other side of this contract for free and they have to be remunerated the minimum for a contract is  per share for some very liquid etfs but for most instruments it is  thus  per contract for  shares when you buy a call or put this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date the rd party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses see below

the value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike on the share price going up and down the shares volatility how fast  far it goes up or down and the time passing

when you buy a contract the strike and the expiration date is known however the share price and volatility will constantly change all the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing closer to the expiration date

the intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price it is above  only when you can exercise the contract the extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time for pretty much all options this extrinsic value is above  and will slowly drop to  as we get closer to the expiration

lets take an example with a share price of 

say you buy a call with a strike of  expiring in a month for  the intrinsic value is     the extrinsic value is     said differently if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date your call contract would bring you  per share you would have lost  due to the time passing

similarly you buy a put with a strike of  expiring in a month for  the intrinsic value is     the extrinsic value is    

it is worth noting that any call with a strike price at  or above has  of intrinsic value if you pay  for a  call all the  is extrinsic value if the stock price does not go over  you will lose the full  per share so a  loss per contract similarly a put with a strike price at  or below has  of intrinsic value if you pay  for a  call all the  is extrinsic value your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under 

note that in these examples i use the same price for the call and put options that are  away from the strike price but its not always the case the call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility market expectations potential dividends cost of money etc

the basics at the moment itm and otm

there are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls

an option is at the money at the moment when the current share value is matching the strike the share price is  and the strike of  for both the call and put contracts will be considered at the money

an option is in the money itm when the contract has some intrinsic value the share price is  so a call at  is in the money with  of intrinsic value a put at  is in the money with  of intrinsic value too

an option is deep in the money when the option is itm and the strike is far from the current share price for example more than  for example with a share price of  a  call will be considered deep in the money same for a  put

conversely an option is out of the money if there is no intrinsic value with a  share price a  call is out of the money a  put is out of the money the money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value there is no intrinsic value an option is deep out of the money when the option is otm and the strike is far from the current share price for example with a share price of  a  call will be considered deep out of the money same for a  put

as the share price goes up and down depending on the option strikes it can switch between itm to at the moment to otm the option price will always reflect that and will be based on the time at expiration and the current share volatility

few key things to note

 the deeper itm an option is the more expensive it is as it gets deeper itm the intrinsic value increases the extrinsic value decreases you have a higher chance for the option to be worth something and you will lose less money on the extrinsic value the price of deep itm options will move very closely to the underlying shares a positive correlation for calls a negative correlation for puts
 the deeper otm an option is the less expensive it is again otm option price is pure extrinsic value you have a very small chance for the option to be worth something by expiration
 the maximum extrinsic value is when the option is at the moment it is purely extrinsic value with barely any intrinsic value these option strikes are the most sensitive to time volatility and share price

here is an example with the same share price of  for a call you could get something like this

strike    premium    intrinsic    extrinsic    deep itm

strike    premium    intrinsic    extrinsic    itm

strike    premium      intrinsic      extrinsic    at the moment

strike    premium      intrinsic      extrinsic    otm

strike    premium      intrinsic      extrinsic    deep otm

you can imagine the same table for a put but in the other direction

it is worth noting that if you have a  call and you decide to exercise it you would directly get  of proceeds per share but you would also destroy the extrinsic value to  losing  of proceeds instead of exercising your call you are much better off selling your call for  in general there are not many reasons to exercise your options selling them is more advantageous

options,investing,Hawkish Powell keeps 0.75% hike option open for september,"here the most important remarks powell just made at jackson hole hope this helps

in his speech powell mentioned that  basis points remains an option for the fomc september meeting this is higher than the anticipated  bps

overall fed will keep raising untill inflation is under control and referred to historic times where this failed

powell also indicated fed will keep rates high in the longterm to counter speculation fed would start cutting in 

he also indicated raising rates will hurt economy and households to some extend

seems fed doesnt want to repeat mistakes of the past and remain hawkish so not so good news for the stock and bond market",985,extremely expensive dollar is back on the menu boys,"i think the main message from powell was that no pivot is currently being considered

market,investing,Gamestop Big Picture: Market Mechanics,"disclaimer i am not a financial advisor this entire post represents my personal views and opinions and should not be taken as financial advice or advice of any kind whatsoever i encourage you to do your own research take anything i write with a grain of salt and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch also full disclosure i hold a net long position in Gamestop Corporation (GME) but my cost basis is very low and im using money i can absolutely lose my capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours 

rather than doing a writeup of friday i think the time i have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics  as i mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week my first glance was that friday was a low conviction low volume day where momentum tradersand volatility arbitraging hft algos were skirmishing and a slightly deeper look tells me thats probably the case for almost the entire day up to the last minutes before close

there was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain  keep in mind also that on friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with Gamestop Corporation (GME) and Gamestop Corporation (GME) price was also protected from aggressive shortside attack due to the uptick rule

 capital flow liquid float and price

ok so lets go with a diagram i put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze  this is not very formaljust conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price liquid free float and capital required to move things around



as you can see in the diagram i figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw

on the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold which moves the fulcrum to the left

the lower the liquid free float or the further to the left the fulcrum goes the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow net selling or buying on share price  importantly as the diagrams on the right half show its not a linear relationship  the closer the liquid free float comes to  the faster the price volatility increases theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 

i find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify  on the extremely liquid side if you have all of the tens of millions of Gamestop Corporation (GME) shares in play dropping  in to buy shares probably doesnt even register on the ticker  on the other extreme if what if there was only  share in play  that same  instantly prices Gamestop Corporation (GME) at  a shareif you can even get the person holding it to sell

since company value is estimated marktomarket Gamestop Corporation (GME) would instantly become rated one of the most  if not the most valuable companies in the world  this is in no way true of course as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to reprice the company

so in the grand scheme of things in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze the primary factor is locking up actively tradedliquid free float  also important to keep in mind locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility reaching its limit where going from  actively traded shares to  actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share

so simple right  actually yes however dont mistake simple for easy absolutely not the same thing in this case

 market games

so Gamestop Corporation (GME) and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants  on the one hand you have normal investors and traders who dont really pay attention to it at all and if they do they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility people tend to short stocks as price goes up and cover shorts as price drops so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable

then you have what ill call market gamers  these are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish and just pay attention to what they actually do  there are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance and shorting is one of them as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a companys share price and actually harm the company badly  the counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze which gets worse with extreme price volatility

imagine it this way  short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange featurea closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that if slammed with a high enough day or week end price blows open and sucks their account capital through and possibly their brokers capital too until theyve patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short

thats not how youre supposed to look at it but thats kind of how it actually works in practice  most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way but with millenials and younger jumping in to the market were talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing  through games intended to take to complete using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers  thats kind of what Gamestop Corporation (GME) is like from a certain point of viewa speed run through the market blitzing and confusing everyone watchingthrowing a ton of money at hedge funds short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole  of course people are getting jumpy

 battleground  strategy and tactics

in a way Gamestop Corporation (GME) has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people  wall street vs wsb is basically the way its been depicted in the media and a number of them seem to be taking it personally

with a battleground stock i find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground but with territory marked out by stock price  it helps you consider the impact on each side what their motives are and tactical and strategic implications  the reason i think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground the issue is no longer about price discoveryits about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal which changes the dynamics of the trade

in my opinion the retail strengthdefensive line is at the  level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week  this is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from  to  which triggered the first squeeze

my guess is shortside strength hardens at the  level based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze  what this means is that you can expect some shortside people to actively short more at that level possibly following through on momentum as many of them want to prove a point that Gamestop Corporation (GME) is a  stock as stated by a number of them on cnbc   might seem like a low number given fridays close but remember that friday trading was subject to the uptick rule so the short effectively could not push back and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the longside advance as much as possible and lure them off their strength as much as possible

say what  is there a point to those analogies like that  why yes of course because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign

remember in the grand scheme of things the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float  that means buying and holding shares  the question is how much will it cost you to move the needle on that so to speak  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float the longer itll take and the more expensive it will be  it is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out loosening float back up

how about on the long side  you want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so  this means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair  why  because it means youre buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float and also that their short position is at a lower average price lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze

the above is why in some cases you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze  you can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning  once you think youve accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move you spike the price back the other way and its effectively game over  it can take some time to play out to its conclusion but that is the essence of it

lets make it concrete and put some numbers to it  lets say you need to lock up mio more shares for the squeeze no idea just using the number for easy math  if you can buy it all skirmishing at the  line youll pay Banta Corporation (BN) to do it  if instead youve extended to the  line youre going to pay Banta Corporation (BN)  if youre an alphaseeking whale why pay  more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it  if you recall i referenced seeing what i thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my rd post

that being said you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think youre already close to blowing up the next short interest holder

if you think youre close then youre looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible

that is very similar to the price action we saw on friday at the end of the day as mentioned earlier  if you think about it if the goal is the have the price atabove a certain point at the end of the day what is more efficient  rush in the morning then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it or wait until later in the day as late as you think you can manage and then push to that point at the very last tick

that at least is a very high level view of what youre trying to accomplish but it gets very complicated in the details  if youre dueling with a good hft algorithm you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock kind of like fouling someone in basketball which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider luld allowances but still doable even if you have to do it by sucking price level up maybe to give you  mins to call your buddy at blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that

another thing to keep in mind  one of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time is it might not be a one and done blowout possibly on purpose  think about itif you can get people to keep piling short interest inparticularly for emotional reasons you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point  think of the citron guy who reshorted back in around what  or  i think  all because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of   there are people piling back in right now  who knows how many times theyre willing to reload the short float

ok so this post is much longer than i originally intended anyway but i think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion  a number of people asked me why i said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point  if you havent already figured out why try to think about it or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion

a couple of final points

 assuming the longside people continue to lock up liquid float remember that volatility can get greater in both directions  this can mean that you get wiped out if youre somehow still trading Gamestop Corporation (GME) on margin as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later
 greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside  premarket and after hours trading dont have circuit breakers so it could get wild during those times too
 also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently  after the first frustrating day of this happening with Gamestop Corporation (GME) i made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so id have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen  for those of you on tos use it on the  minute chart  note that the luld tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day so youd have to adjust the parameters or just keep it in mind  i use it with the step lines vs the default line  if price crosses the guard lines then youre getting closeif it crosses the circuit breaker line then youre about to be or already are getting halted  here is the code

s anti war protests water gate  oil embargo vietnam cont

s cold war cont  inflation

s gulf war

s   war on terror  iraq war great financial crisis

 covid  ukraine war ect

there  is always uncertainty and some have sort of argued that in the late s was sort of a anomaly and if you were a cautions investor maybe for the fist time in  years you looked around and found nothing hugely concerning soviet union fell  iraq war was won ect

but then looked what happened the stock market went into a huge bubble and took like  years to recover  so just looking at past history when every thing is good might not be the best time to invest as its probably going to be a massive bubble

so in the past  years or so maybe in the slate s things looked good but massive bubbles also formed so maybe the best time to invest is not when everything looks good everything will be over priced","yes the market is always uncertain nothing is ever different

price,investing,A Deep Dive into Nikola's FCEV Design and Price Model,"hey everyone  im a mechanical engineering student with a hobby interest in finance  iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) spent the last few days figuring out if nikolas leasing model is actually possible  theres some really wacky stuff going on in nikolas presentations and financial projections and i wanted to share my findings

xb

this is an absolute wall of words and i wouldnt be offended if you didnt want to read it all  in the first half i try to tease out the cost per mile of an actual fuel cell electric vehicle fcev given the specification nikola lists   next there is a portion where i look at the discrepancies between their financial projections and their lease breakdown   then a quick little peanut gallery where i look at their unrealistic assumptions and the hypocrisy of their comparisons  finally a more serious portion where i discuss the design efficiency and utility implications of nikolas chosen power output and battery capacity  hope you guys enjoy

xb

lets get started

nikola claims that they have the industry first holistic leasing program including maintenance fuel and use of the vehicle they plan on leasing for  per mile   margin  this implies an expense of   per mile to nikola

hydrogen costs

according to the doe it currently costs King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) to produce compress and dispense hydrogen  nikola claims they can do this for King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG)  i highly doubt their estimate and will elaborate on that later  hydrogen has a specific energy  kwhkg  a fuel cell electric vehicle fcev has an average thermal efficiency of   a diesel semi tractor which easily compares to nikolas offerings consumes about  kwh of work per km or  per mile of useful work loaded

this implies the nikola truck will use  kwh of hydrogen per mile at a cost of  per mile or  using their estimates  the doe estimate could be pretty rosy as well hindenburg cited a practical price of  per King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) for hydrogen in their report  nikolas estimate in the leasing breakdown is  miles per King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) of hydrogen   per King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG)  that works out to mile  our estimates are pretty close excluding hydrogen costs  it looks like in a surprising twist they actually overestimated the energy consumption of a tractor  or maybe not  well get to that

icct tractortrailer fuel consumption  

why do i doubt their hydrogen cost estimates   per King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) implies  per kwh of hydrogen produced  the average price for industrial electricity in arizona the state they are headquartered in was kwh some of the cheapest in the us  of course there isnt a  conversion of electricity to hydrogen an electrolyzer uses about  kwh per King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) of hydrogen  specific energy of kwhkg making the electricity expense alone in excess of  per kwh of hydrogen  electricity must also be used to compress the hydrogen  this would take another  kwh though were already over budget  god forbid they use california electricity at an average cost of  per kwh  the electricity expense for the electrolyzers alone exceeds their estimates much less depreciation expense cost of capital maintenance expense salary expense etc  clearly a bogus number

i suppose they can use renewable excess during offhours for cheap but the rapidly decreasing costs of energy storage will likely level out those low prices rather quickly  this also only works in arizona and a select few other states california not included  there is the issue of a startup paying to build huge electrolyzers that might have a utilization factor of  and additional high pressure storage will be needed  the abhorrent upfront capex needed to try and drive down operating costs is not viable for them

eia electricity prices nationwide  

nrel h cost analysis from   this is just about the most recent research i can find  the abject lack of new material tells me its not exactly a hoppin field  

fuel cell costs

part of the reason there are currently so few fcvs on the road today is the limited service life of a fuel cell  fuel cells are precision manufactured components that degrade quickly when jostled  vibrated too violently  this is not good when combined with the rockhard suspensions of semi tractors

the doe targets a useful life of  miles for a fuel cell  currently there is no information confirming this target has been met  a toyota murai comes with a  mile warranty on its fc  for the sake of argument i will assume nikola Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. (FCS) can meet this target  the doe targets a cost of kw for fuel cell production in  provided mass hits   this hasnt happened yet but i will again assume this to give nikola the best chance  as an aside  nikolas decision to use exclusively General Motors Corporation (GM) fc technology in their badger pickup indicates to me they have nothing up their sleeve to make the technology more viable despite my optimistic assumptions

ill assume the nikola twos fuel cell is  kw less than the  kw claimed output  i think it  likely their horsepower claim will be a peak power figure only achievable when the motors draw on the battery  fc  i cannot confirm this because nikola does not list the output of their motors and fc separately along with myriad other questionable or lack of claims  i think this is reasonable considering fc thermal efficiency is maximized between  and  load and a semi will average  kw of useful work required on the highway translating to  kw of fc usage  this is near the peak efficiency band of a pemfc  this assumption also allows steadystate operation at  of the rated output  this implies an upfront cost of   a targeted useful life of  miles implies a depreciation expense of  per mile

nrel stack durability and performance vs load chart  

battery costs

using bnef  battery cost estimates of kwh that equates to  of battery expense  assuming a useful life of m miles more than any existing warranty currently covers that results in a depreciation expense of  per mile

chassis and the rest

lastly i extrapolated an fcev cogs of  per truck from their financial projections minus the  of equipment already listed and a  scrap value i pulled out of my ass to try and help nikola here leaves  depreciated over k miles or a  depreciation expense per mile

maintenance costs

nikola assumed a mile maintenance cost  any engineer should be able to see such a claim and immediately question it  tires alone should account for  per mile  that leaves  for brakes air lines hvac wiring electrical equipment motors inverters those battery and fc expenses i already calculated sensors etc  they make no additional provisions for the batteryfc in their leasing breakdown  pure unadulterated bullshit   the icct puts Beverly Enterprises. Inc. (BEV) per mile maintenance at mile  how they squeezed  of those costs out as an unproven startup by going for a more complex fcbev hybrid is beyond me

cost of trucking  

nikola leasing cost breakdown p  

leasing conclusions

adding their laughably low per mile maintenance expense of          gives us an aggregate  per mile expense for nikola  using their fuel expense estimate of  this equates to  still more than their projected gross expenses  the first estimate is  over they need for their claimed  gross margin at  per mile  note  i used a projected battery expense projected fc service life target and projected fc production expense  none of these have been met  i used the average resitive forces acting on a us tractortrailer which appear to be lower than the number nikola uses  i did not include warranty expenses in my estimate  additionally these are expenses and includes  profit for the suppliers of these parts  the gmnikola deal clearly shows there will be little vertical integration in their production and such allowances would have to be made

a more reasonable estimate including a still optimistic  interest expense for truck capex a  annual warranty expense corresponding to their presented  estimated reserve  that reserve by the way is very optimistic  tesla used a higher reserve on the s for years while building a simpler product with a warranty lengthdistance a literal order of magnitude lower than the nikola truck  a still low maintenance expense of  and a  margin for battery  fc production we end up with an  per mile expense or more than nikola can afford even when using their untenable  per King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) hydrogen estimate  this is before ga expenses  their leasing business model is not possible

lease projections v income projections  internal chaos or outright fraud

its possible some of the folks at nikola have already found those problems out though  nikola says they have plans to lease their trucks  theyve had presentation slides including the idea and their truck descriptions on their website include a leasing plan  in their most recent presentation at the Deutsche Bank AGCO Corporation (AG) (DB) global auto industry conference in june however the leasing cost breakdown slide was conspicuously missing  their financial projections slide showed  fcev trucks being produced in  and  million in revenue from fcev sales  this represents  per truck and their fcev revenue scales exactly linearly into their  projected sales no room for residual from the  trucks  theyre projecting to sell them  revenue from maintenance and hydrogen sales are also listed separately  their financial projections clearly show the upfront sale of trucks with additional hydrogen fueling and maintenance revenue and the leasing model slide has disappeared  its easy to see why  their projected combined expenses and capex exceeds  billion through  significantly more than their current  billion in assets and a couple of lease payments would allow for  this would take some intense share dilution not something i think trevor would be on board with or extremely expensive leverage

its not like theyre going to get cheap loans secured against their proprietary trucks requiring their proprietary stations to run only their customers preset routes  a bank wouldnt want that kind of collateral  the leasing idea is a real mess

nikla Deutsche Bank AGCO Corporation (AG) (DB) presentation projections are nd to last page  

one can claim that the lease model is still in the description of the trucks but so are battery and fuel cell specifications for the nikola one  the nikola one was ostensibly never actually powered by hydrogen and development has since been abandoned  it looks like their leasing idea may have been abandoned as well

ill also point out that an expected  fcev maintenance revenue of  million on  trucks sold assuming an average of  miles per truck sold in  the average mileage if the trucks are sold at a constant rate through the fy and  per truck in  equates to  cents per mile more than double the  projected maintenance costs in the april lease presentation  either they plan on making a killing from maintenance or there was some aggressive reshuffling of numbers when maintenance went from an expense to revenue stream or vice versa

the same analysis of hydrogen expenses puts their per King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) revenue at   still low but a hefty sum above their  cost average on the leasing slide

if we use their projected fcev maintenance revenue of   per King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KG) h revenue and  truck price depreciated over  years wno interest expense the cost of ownership according to their income projections is  per mile for a  mile year  more than they say a diesel will cost  oops

thats most of what i wanted to talk about  its pretty clear that nikola cannot possibly make a profit with their lease model and nikolas finance department has indirectly acknowledged this  hydrogen tech is still many many years away  nikolas move fast and break things approach though im not convinced weve seen much moving outside of gravity assists will end up a move fast and bankrupt things strategy

xb



xb

i now want to take a few moments to look at some of the sillier things i found in my research

in a laughably exuberant turn of events nikola projects  gross margins during their first year of production  thats downright cute  they plan on ostensibly slapping General Motors Corporation (GM) Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. (FCS)  batteries on iveco platforms and beating the margins of all publicly traded auto companies sans ferrari within a few months of production start  its that easy  get your shit together ford

on nikolas website under their trucks they have a comparison of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. (FCS) bevs and diesel where they seem to forget their trucks have hundreds of kwhs of battery storage onboard  they claim hydrogen acts as a buffer and grid balance while batteries are a drain on the grid  you heard it hear first folks batteries cant be used as a grid buffer only a grid drain  they also claim h is the most abundant element on the planet while batteries are made of nonrenewable resources dangerouscostly to mine  makes me wonder why they chose to put so many on their trucks  also hilariously hypocritical considering platinum required for pemfcs is one of the rarest metals on earth

design considerations and odd choices

i want to take a moment to talk about chassis design and the implications of nikolas set power parameters  and i want to start with a quote from elon musk during the tesla semi reveal

we designed the tesla truck like a bullet musk said a normal diesel truck is designed like a barn wall the tesla semi is more aerodynamic than a  million bugatti chiron sports car he said

a bold claim but i believe this to be correct  cheesy but correct  why  cooling requirements  the more cooling air you need the less favorable aerodynamics youll have  in the simple representation of an engine there is a fuel input a work output and a heat output  a gas engine  especially one not designed with fuel efficiency in mind like the chirons will likely only output  of its fuel input as a work output  the chiron makes  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) and needs to reject  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) of heat at full throttle  the goal of a chiron isnt to slip through the air AngloGold Ashanti Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (AU) contraire  its designed suck in as much air as possible for cooling and brute its way to  mph through raw horsepower  most modern sedans have more favorable aerodynamics than a bugatti

xb

on the other hand about  of the inputs from an Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) charger make it to the wheels  a major factor that makes evs so efficient  this means elon can put for example  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) of motors in his truck and only worry about rejecting  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) of heat at full load an easy task  thats less cooling than a prius needs and the truck can be designed with virtually zero air input constraints  he can swing his x the acceleration dick around and the only tradeoff is beefier driveline bits for the extra torque and bigger motors

Cendant Corporation (CD) lists on wikipedia  note almost every production car below Cendant Corporation (CD) is either a small displacement diesel or electric  no supercars in sight  

the chirons standard Cendant Corporation (CD) is   a  ford windstar minivan has a standard Cendant Corporation (CD) of   not exactly a prestigious club haha



hydrogen is a different story  the thermal efficiency of a fcev above  load will dip down into the  range  the average efficiency of a diesel truck is  and it will dip to  at max RPM, Inc. (RPM) full load  ever seen the video where trevor says the production trucks wont need as much cooling as their current prototypes  hes lying through his teeth  a  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) fc would need more than  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) of cooling as much if not more than a Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) diesel  its also important to note that less heat is lost in exhaust from a pemfc and lower operating temps mean that actual cooling airflow required is significantly more than an equivalent diesel would require   Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) diesels are already built like a brick with a front aftercooler  radiator the size of a football field  trevors dick swinging has major consequences  more cooling means more drag more weight in heat sinksradiators and more power draw to move coolant  these all create positive feedback loops eg more air requirements mean less favorable aerodynamics  more drag which means more power draw at speed which means more cooling which means more air requirements  its not all fun and games like the pure Beverly Enterprises. Inc. (BEV) tesla is making

xb

daimlers recently announced h semi offering only has  kw and they can recycle their waste heat to warm up incoming liquid hydrogen nikola uses compressed hydrogen and wont have the same luxury  running so much horsepower is a real head scratcher one would think their head of rds only experience was pouring concrete or something

xb

its also important to note us tractortrailers are hard capped at  lbs  this means that every pound of tractor weight is a pound taken from potential cargo  yknow the part that actually makes money  one has to wonder why nikola is keeping  lbs of batteries on the tractor their website showed they arent fans of the stuff  its enough to run a loaded tractor two full hours on battery alone more than a regenerative braking system would require or power peaking during a hill climb  its dumb  kwh would be more than enough when an ondemand primemover like a hydrogen cell is also onboard  its an expensive and opulent display to the vexation of customers who would in all likelihood much prefer an extra  tons of cargo capacity

features like  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) and  kwh of battery appeal more to retail investors than trucking companies

xb

actual conclusion time  i think that i pretty conclusively showed that

 nikolas hydrogen cost projections are bogus  there isnt even enough money there to pay for the electrolysis and compression much less maintenance depreciation or labor
 nikolas leasing costs undercutting diesel is bogus  one can disprove that with their own financial projections much less the real costs of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. (FCS) and h electrolysis
 nikolas plan to lease the trucks is totally divorced from reality according to their own financial projections
 nikolas projected per mile operating  maintenance expenses are beyond indefensible
 a myriad of odd marketing focused design choices limit the trucks onroad efficiency and utility to potential customers

if you made it this far congrats",1116,mechanical engineer here who used to design electrolyzers fuel cells and hybrid vehicle powertrains your analysis is spot on nkla is a fraud,removed,excellent post worth mentioning that daimler unveiled their new hydrogren truck just a few days ago and they mentioned that for hydrogen to work it will require strong government support to implement an infrastructure since hydrogen is expensive and complex quite a different tone from nikola

share price,investing,PRPL - cash is king; significant upside unappreciated in current share price,"prpl  cash is king and upside unappreciated

i am on a mobile phone so will keep this short apologies for the shitty formatting net of the note is that prpl has generated nearly mm of cash in the first two months of q which means profits are surging beyond imagination through its Domtar Incorporated (DTC) transformation the share price at  drastically undervalues this

a few facts

 at q end the company reported mm of cash mm of inventory and mm of accounts payable
 as of the business update released in early june the company reported a may month end cash balance of  million an increase of  million in just two months as sales increase



 in may alone they recorded mm plus of orders m from Domtar Incorporated (DTC) an increase of 
 the company has nearly mm shares outstanding fully diluted an enterprise value of nearly b and mm of ebitda trading at a x multiple 

so lets talk about cash if the companys cash in april and may increased solely on operating income that would mean they generated an incremental mm of ebitda and nearly  per share however this is likely overstated as the company noted inventories decreased and Domtar Incorporated (DTC) orders are cash in advance you pay before you get the product

lets assume inventory declined by  which is a massive number operationally particularly as sales are increasing which would explain mm of the cash increase the other variable is the uplift from Domtar Incorporated (DTC) which has grown from a run rate of about mm a month in q to mm of orders in may the question is what value between  and  did cash benefit by customers paying cash ahead of receiving inventory deferred revenue vs what was recognized into earnings because Domtar Incorporated (DTC) has been ramping through the last  days id think this has been normalizing to a steady state at this point lets assume half is a working capital benefit 

so of the mm cash benefit  was from Domtar Incorporated (DTC) PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) orders and  mm from inventory leaving mm for true cash from earnings on mm shares that is  cents a share for the first two months of the quarter assume another month of consistency to april and may you are at  a share just in one quarter on an  dollar share price 

assuming that is right that means ebitda is doubling for the full year in just one quarter and in track to generate nearly mm of ebitda for the next year 

giving them a x multiple consistent with tpx implies  upside to the share price giving them a growthier multiple due to surging demand which is appropriate  lets say x to be conservative  would imply a b tev or  upside to the share price in the near term 

when will the market appreciate this and price it in well they should already but because the company is newer and less followed they arent yet but once earnings are crystallized in q and announced in mid august it should be obvious to all my guess is shares will be trading at or north of  once earnings are released

covid appears to be accelerating their Domtar Incorporated (DTC) momentum and mgmt is more or less telling us they will have an absolute blow out quarter by giving us their end of month cash balances

 elliot owns a major chunk of Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU) they have significant sway on the board 
 they are partially exposed to newcastle coal prices but a good part of their business is long term contracts most of which are still locked in at low prices
 they are in the process of renegotiating long term contracts tbd how long that takes or the results coal prices worldwide are high
 they sell coal for delivery into the futures market and got margin called last spring on their short futures position it was massive and they had to dilute to post additional collateral the current price reflects that those hedges are rolling off over the next two quarters they will get that cash back on their balance sheet
 theyre restricted from doing buybacksdivvies from their loan covenantssurety agreements this was part of the bankruptcy restructuring bond holders want to be paid first Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU) is net cash positive and printing money so its really only a matter of time before these are paid off and they unlock this restriction
 they have earnings in october and an investor day first in years in november likely a big announcement coming then its speculated they may enter into a debt agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and will unlock buybacks andor analyst coverage
 Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU) delivers most of its us coal via rail so the rail strike  subsequent union agreement signed three days ago now in writing is a major win for them since it removes delivery uncertainty

 peabody filed for bankruptcy during a raging bull market in  after a long commodity bear market literally nobody outside of some extremely savvy value investors wanted to buy it a bunch of people bought it for under  so when it spiked up above  there was quite a bit of profit taking
 convertible bond owners getting stock and taking profit
 Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU) has always had a decent amount of options activity since they cant do divvies or buybacks yet its the perfect stock to wheel a percentage of the daily volume is driven by options Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU) typically traded around  vol for a while now that its rangebound its been in the s
 value investing and commodity investing has sucked for a long time since rates have been low plus its a coal stock and has an esg score of like zero laugh out loud a lot of institutions cant own it so who owns it some retail some sophisticated investors a few small hedge funds and elliot this creates volatility because those groups are much more active investors and are willing to punt the stock around

i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please  if you have any questions or concerns","with options the risks involve depend on the underlying the underlying doesnt have to be a stock it can be an index and it can also be a futures contract 

i dont trade futures but i have considered trading options on es and rty futures instead of spx or rut but with futures you have to also deal with contango and backwardation and the strategies can get more interestingcomplex 

as for leverage  leverage on futures can be higher since margin is calculated differently using span but with options if you are trading from a portfolio margin not to be confused with regt margin account you may get similar amount of leverage 

as for losing more than   it depends on the strategies being employed for a trader that is writing option contracts you can lose more than the initial value of the contract for an option buyer your max loss is limited to the value of the contracts when the position is opened so for options the risk characteristics are dependent on the strategies being employed","please stay away from futures if your asking these questions

a future contract is exactly that you promise to buy or sell the underlying at that price an option contract owner has the option to choose if heshe wants to exercise or not in an future contract both sides must fulfill their contractual obligation to buy or to sell

for example es emini future on sp  is around  points right now every  point is  if sp tanks to  its a x k loss or win depending if long or short

also if it rips to  its a x  k move

if you owned the option you paid the premium to choose if you want to exercise or not if you buy a call and the underlying tanks you just loose your premium if you buy a future contract and the underlying tanks you have to pay up there is no choice remember"

this really should be a  level since it involves some numbers although you wont yet need a calculator but ill just keep the numbering sequential for ocd sake  on that note im aiming this at people who read and understood the first two  which were brief but dense  also were getting to the point where i cant generalize options as much so note that this post and probably the rest is geared more towards trading options as opposed to things like hedging or using as synthetic instruments  as usual corrections are welcome


disclaimer i am writing this as an educational supplement  my motivation for writing these has been explicitly to help fill the gap in more advanced conversations  by no means am i encouraging anyone to trade with this information  its worth pointing out that in efforts to make these short and productive iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) trimmed out the potentially ridiculous risk with options  perhaps ill dedicate an entire post for that







exchange

quick note on this  unlike stocks which are listed in specific exchanges like National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) or New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stock options are not bound to a particular exchange since theyre essentially just bets  its worth knowing that the chicago board options exchange or cboe is the biggest among them theres like  or so 
other ones and is home to the all popular vix more on this at a later date  but to make things simple when picking an exchange theres usually a  choice which figures it out for you





the market

so its finally time to pick some options  well just like stocks the first stop is to check out the prices  but now were going to pay special attention to the market as well because although market conditions play a part in stocks they play a crucial role with options  also if youre speculating on a price move the trick is to shop around for opportunities involving various strategies using options andor stocks because there are many ways to bet  many more than just up or down that is  

while looking at buying options a good rule of thumb is to make sure theres healthy a lot of volume  having a liquid market will make sure that theres enough buyers and sellers to get in and back out of the position with relative ease  its entirely possible that you buy an option and then have nobody to sell it back to at a halfway reasonable price when the time is right  

this also tends to tighten up the bidask spread remember bid is sell price ask is buy price  this is another big difference with options  typically when buying stocks as long as theyre somewhat popular i dont even look at the spread  in fact most popular stock quoters wont even show them  but youll notice that options chains rarely have a single price and instead show you the bidask separately  the reason for this is that with options pennies matter  and the spread will consume into your profits  

take a look at this  with march expiration  youll see that there are some options with  cent spread green and others with  cent spreads red  if you were to buy options from the red circle youre instantly losing  dollars per contract not to mention commissions  i just checked some Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) jan  calls and some of them have like a  spread  thats  per contract instantly evaporated

the  factors i can think of that determine liquidity are option popularity some stocks dont attract options traders and strike price  expiration date  even popular stocks lose volume if you look to far ahead or if you pick strike prices that are far from the money  

make that   open interest or Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) or original poster int  this is a metric that youll typically see in options chains indicating the number of live contracts which are out on the market high Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) would imply that theres high volume the reason why volume and Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) are not necessarily the same is because in practice you can write a contract create a new one and adding  to the Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) tally and later buy it back subtracting  to Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) tally  if this scenario played out in an empty market the volume would be  and Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) would be 






timing

timing is everything with options  remember that the moment you buy an option it starts losing extrinsic value from time decay so this is important  as noted by  in the last post time decay is not linear  meaning that stocks wont lose a set amount every day until expiration  


 showing what the time decay looks like as dictated by the  model  youll notice the drop in price due to time decay exponentially increases at  days from expiration  this doesnt mean options with less than  days are no good but if you buy them it should be part of your strategy like say a day trade


another important thing to consider is recent news with the underlying stock  big events can temporarily dislodge prices which you can also use in your favor if you want  announced dividends is a big one  for various reasons on an exdividend date call prices will go down and put prices will go up  another big one is earnings releases  youll notice a huge buildup in premiums due to implied volatility as an earnings release approaches and then a huge drop the day after  this affects calls and puts alike  





edit strike price

credit to  for bringing this up


additional observation from  who points out that this point becomes gray area when the strike and underlying price are close

another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value because after all when the expiration day comes thats all theyre worth  so buying an option with no intrinsic value not itm has the potential to be worthless upon expiration  

that said theyre not always bad depending on your strategy  for example buying an otm option is sort of like buying a house with a  interest mortgage your monthly mortgage payments only go towards the interest but not towards the principal of the house  some people actually do this because they believe the value of the house will go up and theyll resell it for profit





leverage

this is a very important concept which early options traders dont realize right away and is the reason options can be so powerful andor dangerous

options harness the power of leverage by relying on changes in price to derive their values and not necessarily the price of the underlying  for example lets compare McDonald's Corporation (MCD) and grpn currently trading at  and  respectively  if you look at their march expirations options youll see that the price for an atthemoney call strike prices  and  is about  for each of them  and yes i realize McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is not quite  yet but if you factor out intrinsic and extrinsic values youll end up about the same

so for  you can buy a call which expires next month for either of these two companies and youve exposed yourself to  shares of said company 

now ceteris paribus if the price of both grpn and McDonald's Corporation (MCD) went up tomorrow by  the price of the McDonald's Corporation (MCD) call would go up to around  while the price of grpns call would go up to around   thats the difference between profiting  vs   

and the reason for this is because if McDonald's Corporation (MCD) went up by  it would be up  and if grpn went up by  it would only be up by  and the premium only cares about relative price movement and not necessarily about the underlyings value this is a simplification

this is also why expensive stocks like Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) are popular with options gamblers because as youve already seen here they can have huge swings  and this is also how a lot of people go broke


i realize i sped through this topic  if it left you confused ask and ill either reply or modify the post






the chain


and finally the chain  this is just to tie up some of these concepts and you can see what they look like in the real world  at first it can be overwhelming when looking at options chains but if you know what youre looking for theyre not that bad  im going to show you what it looks like in optionshouse but most chains will be similar in nature and information




 purple circles  calls and related metrics bid price ask price volume and open interest

 blue circles  puts and related metrics bid price ask price volume and open interest

 green circles  expiration date

 cyan circles  strike prices

 yellow circles  options that are at or very near the money

the other numbers are for a later day

also to highlight the risks involved go back and look at the february expiration contracts still open under Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) both calls and puts which are expiring worthless tomorrow  if you go back and look at marchs prices youll pretty much get an idea of what those contracts were worth a month ago  thats a lot of money lost

  actually they are bound to particular exchanges similar to stock only that they dont have a primary listing of course this doesnt really mean anything significant that i can think of since probably anyone reading this  will be using a smart router and not directing their order to a particular exchange

 another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value because after all when the expiration day comes thats all theyre worth

  thats a little bit misleading because only as we get very close to expiration do we know who is in the money in other words you could argue that it is more risky to buy a slightly in the money option than a slightly out of the money option because now you are risking the intrinsic value as well"

current stock price,investing,Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble!,"lately there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever

why the stock market is in a bubble  investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dotcom bubble  

even professional investors whom i consider levelheaded and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable

this will not last  

adding to all of this we can see that the 

while its easy to say that its all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend i feel that we might be missing the other side of the story the s are wildly different times compared to the s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens there is an immense difference in the available capital interest rates and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to  years back 

so what i wanted to analyze is should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the new normal given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in finally this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments 

the warning signs

lets first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market spoiler alert  there are a lot of them

pe shiller pe cape

the price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the marketcompany is overvalued when compared to historical trends shiller pe is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal pe

the current concern is that as of nov the shiller pe for the sp  crossed  which is the highest reading in the last two decades the last time the shiller pe crossed  was during the  dot com bubble the value reached only a max of  before the  financial crisis

the red flag here is that those who invested when the cape was above  last time  had to wait another  years to break even for a brief period of time just before the  housing market crash and then wait another  more years before the market consistently settled above their buyin price

money supply growth aka money printer go brrr

 while it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat one can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation

increasing use of leverage

there are two ways of using leverage while investing the first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past  years

 for almost  investors shows staggering results  of gen z and  of millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market more than  of the surveyed population borrowed more than k or more for investing while leverage works great in a bull market it can destroy your portfolio during downturns 

 shows an even more concerning trend retail brokers alone are now trading more options than the entire market used to do in  while this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as robinhood fidelity etrade etc its highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it

rise of new issues and speculative assets

more than  billion have been raised by ipos this year this is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the  record in the dust the cherry on top was  where the company is now valued at more than  billion with zero revenue and less than  million in preorder deposits

spacs 

this is without even getting into the speculative world of crypto where  for more than half a billion dollars a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of  billion and there are now more ICOS Corporation (ICOS) than anyone can keep track of

investor expectations

more than the pe ratio i the pricetosales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the companys sales as we can see on the chart below more than double the companies are trading above x their sales when compared to the  dot com bubble

if you consider a  stocks that had a very high ps ratio have underperformed those having low ps ratio since most companies dont grow as per expectations

now thats a lot of bad news for anyone to digest but

are we certain its a bubble

there are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally just because we are in an impressive rally it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash lets look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years

lowinterest rates

this is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the s dotcom bubble between  and  the fed rate varied from    compared to the  this means that the capital available now is much cheaper to prop up the economy after covid than it ever was this is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns

new investors

its no secret that we all hate robinhood  shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investorstraders coming to the market all of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now

k and index funds

as i have highlighted in s the amount of inflow us index funds receive is massive more than  billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the vanguard  index fund this year and index funds are expected to make up  according to  from fidelity the average k account now has a balance of k and  of workers increased their contribution

the key point being all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market 

whats the implication

as long as the above factors remain as is fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital we might see the party go on much longer than expected

conclusion

the market of  is significantly different when compared to the s as we can see there are more investors cheaper capital and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before so i feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dotcom bubble is a tad wrong

but thats not to say that all is well almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future

the expected annual return by investors which is  more than what is realistic  this is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly doubledigit return is the norm

even if we are in a dotcom bubblelike scenario  perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble

basically even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in  investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to tulip mania as early as  making money using that information was hard there were a few investors such as mark cuban and john templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected

it makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market but pundits have been calling a  right now based on fundamentals the chances do look far higher it does make sense to not make significant onetime investments in the market now but changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best longterm strategy

as peter lynch quoted

far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves

until next week

footnotes and existing research

 the amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zerocommission trading model was staggering in the s average commission per trade was 

 as always i am not a financial advisor this is not investment advice please do your own research before investing

 leverage only makes sense as long as the equity you are investing into would give better returns than the cost of capital at which you borrowed otherwise your losses are magnified as you have to pay the interest for the borrowed money as well as take your losses on the underlying asset

stock market,investing,Russian Stock Market to Partially Reopen on Thursday,"russias stock market is set to have a partial reopening thursday nearly a month after it shut down following the invasion of ukraine 
the challenge for moscow is that the resumption of trading could simply send russian stocks back into free fall on feb  the day when president vladimir putin began the assault on ukraine the main russian stock index tumbled  while the index regained a fraction of those losses on feb its last day of tradingthat was before western sanctions hammered the ruble and sent the country into an economic crisis

to limit the fallout moscow has turned to some heavyhanded policies it blocked foreign investors from dumping local stocksa move that some market participants saw as retaliation for a western freeze on russian central bank assets since a big chunk of the russian market is owned by foreigners the russian government ordered its main sovereignwealth fund to buy billions of dollars worth of shares 

the russian stock market could ultimately look very different than it did before with a plan under discussion to split it into separate markets for foreign and local investors according to a person familiar with the matter

russias central bank said wednesday that it will allow trading of  shares out of  included in the benchmark stock index the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) on thursday from  am to  pm moscow time among the companies to be traded are gazprom pjsc and lukoil pjsc bets on the fall of a stock known as shortselling will be banned

under a policy announced by the central bank on feb  russian brokerages arent allowed to let foreign clients sell securities this will prevent foreigners from bolting for the exits as soon as the market reopens which could be ruinous because of their outsize role in russian stocks international institutional investors held about threequarters of the russian markets free float as of february  according to sberbank investment research

that has raised concerns that the market will be skewed by the absence of foreign investors who accounted for nearly half of equities trading volume at the moscow exchange in the first half of last year
there will be an illusion of a working recovering russian stock market even though a huge class of players in the marketforeignerswont have the opportunity to sell said vladimir kreyndel CNOOC Limited (CEO) of etf consulting a moscow firm that advises issuers of exchangetraded funds 

among the western investors that held russian stocks before the freeze were assetmanagement giants vanguard group and fidelity international both firms have said they are reducing exposure to russia
due to the freeze foreign investors wont have much to do when the stock market reopens 

but the plan under consideration by russian officialswhich is still in the discussion stageswould effectively split the countrys securities market in two with one market for foreigners and another for local investors the person familiar with the matter said in this arrangement foreign investors could sell their shares or bonds but would face restrictions on moving the proceeds out of russia because of capital controls that moscow has imposed since february the person said

such a bifurcated market could result in oddities such as the same stock having two different prices that isnt completely unprecedented in china there have long been discrepancies between shares on mainland exchanges in shanghai and shenzhen and those listed in hong kong
it could also prevent further erosion of the rubles value russias currency has stabilized in recent sessions to trade near  rubles to the dollar though it remains  weaker than before russia invaded ukraine

the biggest fear is that the central bank is under sanctions and they dont want foreign investors to sell their shares and take the ruble and buy hard currency said jacob grapengiesser head of eastern europe at emerging markets fund manager east capital

the moscow exchange said monday that it would allow for the settlement of trades that foreign investors had placed before feb  that were still being processed mr grapengiesser said his firm had trades still awaiting settlement from the start of the war that he expects to go through soon 

its a natural step before opening the market you need to take care of those unsettled trades he said things are slowly moving forward
shortly after the war began russias prime minister ordered the countrys national wealth fund to buy up to one trillion rubles equivalent to  billion worth of shares this year analysts also expect some russian oil companies to prop up their share prices with buyback programs

local investors may buy stocks too when russia invaded crimea the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) fell almost  between midfebruary and midmarch of  but by the end of that year it had rebounded more than  from that march low the broad index has posted gains in all but one year since  stocks in unstable countries can also serve as hedges against inflation because locals expect companies can offset rising costs by charging higher prices

the governments efforts have led some to be cautiously optimistic about the reopening initially i think there will be a moderate correction said natalia smirnova a financial adviser in moscow but i wouldnt rule out the possibility that the first day could end up with a modest increase

russia is a minnow of a financial market by global terms in december  the total market capitalization of companies listed on the moscow exchange was about  billion according to the world federation of exchanges which is just under  of the current value of tesla Suncor Energy (Inc.)that made the moscow exchange the th largest bourse by market cap just above brazils b exchange in the wfes ranking of global exchanges

until the war russia mostly attracted attention from specialist emergingmarket funds and hedge funds though it made up only a fraction of holdings for most globally minded investors 

msci Suncor Energy (Inc.)said it would drop russian stocks from its influential indexes that track emerging markets before the war mscis emerging market index had a  weighting for russia ftse russell has also announced plans to remove russian stocks from its indexes the moves will force investors whose holdings track the indexes to sellwhen they can 
wars have led to stockmarket shutdowns before although it is unusual the new york stock exchange closed for about four months when world war i broke out in  the longest closure in the nyses history the beirut stock exchange reopened in  after a nearly year shutdown caused by lebanons civil war",1074,deleted,for anyone thinking to buy the dip my parents still have state obligations from  to sell you,im curious if finra will remove the trading halt on russian adrs they are currently halted under a code related to the exchange being closed but the halt may persist with sanctions

a former longtime investment adviser who is a very active trader iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also worked in private equity for several years

im here to share my strategy on trading and significantly increasing overall income

i have rules that i trade by they work for me theyre guidelines they may or may not be for you

i will share my trades and results i will not discuss or offer opinions on the fundamentals of a company im happy to comment if asked as to what trade i would enter on a company i am not licensed to give advice

what i do is rather simple  yet most advisersinvestors know nothing about it 

its called coveredcall writing im sure many here have heard of it or used this strategy there are various ways to implement using covered calls  i keep it as simple as possible

essentially  you are buying a stock then selling the right to have the shares taken away from you at a particular price on a specific date for selling that right  you receive a premium income

my personal trading rules

  invest in companies you know and want to be invested in quality companies

   diversify industries bankssteeltransportationtechpharma etc

  hedge i keep at least one precious metal company in my portfolio at all times

  keep your emotions in check the market is fluid you will be right you will be wrong dont chase a stock in any direction

  use income to average down if you are invested in several companies not all will move in tandem take some of the income youve generated to average down

  sell the call option right after the purchase of shares or previous option expiry

  if you use margin  only use half of what youre allowed to use none if you dont understand the risks

  stay shortterm the call options i sell are typically  to  weeks out i can always by back shares if theyre taken away

  be patient dont stare at your screen all day unless this is your career

  try to have an options expiring every week generate income weekly

i will put up a couple examples as well",99,"invest in companies you know and want to be invested in quality companies 

thank you for making this rule  where iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) gone wrong with covered calls in the past has been to chase yield rather than trading companies i actually wanted to own kids learn from my mistakes",you didnt mention how you choose the strike price isnt that a fairly important part of covered calls,"this guy probably wasnt a very good investment advisor the income is already accounted for in the premiums and the risk that you are taking in the long run theoretically you would break even with this strategy if you were to just buy and hold except for the fact that covered call premium will typically be taxed at a higher rate than long term gains 

this isnt some secret cheat code for investing the risks and the premium are priced in 

if you really want to sell covered calls heres a potentially better strategy buy etfs with deep options chains sell monthly covered calls about  out of the money during times of high volatility youll still capture about  of the upside while generating bps per month in premium meanwhile etfs allow you to stay diversified spy MidCap SPDR Trust Series I (MDY) iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM) iShares MSCI EAFE Index Fund (EFA) iShares MSCI Emerging Index Fund (EEM) iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG)"

methodology

the program begins by back testing a predefined set of tickers sp in this case using the buy and sell signals listed above in order to reduce biased results i walk through the time period that is i fed the program a single day at a time each day i calculated buy signals and if the conditions were met id purchase the security hold it and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals
once the security was bought and sold id write down the trade and move onto the next day the end result was a list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred in the predefined date range with the predefined list of tickers

id sort these entries by purchase date in ascending order oldest first and every trade that fell on the same day was put into a list and archived in a dictionary with keyword purchasedate the result was a data structure i could query and pull a list of all trades that could have occurred on a specified date

i then had all the information i needed to begin the actual back test i began with the first possible purchase date searched the dictionary to obtain a list of all possible trades that could have occurred on that day chose one at random wrote down the trades information and moved onto the next available purchase date

once all dates were exhausted i calculated an annual return by finding the product of all the years trades i did this  times in order to obtain the average and standard deviation of annual returns since my data didnt tell me which trade occurred when it was impossible for me to define the exact sequence of trades my idea was if i got enough random trade sequences i could create a universe of possible scenarios with the most likely being the most prevalent  it was a way for me to calculate a return and cover all my bases at the same time",215,you know i backtested hundreds of moving averages holding period dates crossovers technical signals and many various combinations  i even tried various backtests with quantifiable macro numbers like monthly ism and even with fundamentals likes pes  iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) backtested a lot of these and found returns above that of an index  when i implemented these systems however they do not work  i was curve fitting and data mining  i suspect you will find the same conclusion,great work what program do you use,"i own a quant trading shop and i tested this out in my simulation system for fun  i expanded the universe and did some basic screening to filter out stocks that arent liquid or easily executed  i bought k per position round lots so youd need about  million to run this at that level assuming my liquid universe

this indicator seemed to have worked ok until fall  but hasnt worked since  a  million investment in spy would have been more profitable over the past  years"

trading strategy,investing,Does this stock trading strategy have a name?,"curious what this may be called besides gambling laugh out loud

so i have  stocks i like in a particular sector that have been following for a couple years very close in price with minor variability talking about usually  cents in difference in extremes

instead of timing price i like to sell a majority of one stock at the higher price and buy the lower price stock for a few cents cheaper per share this results in increasing total number of shares of stock  then the lower priced stock will rise to within one or two cents or higher priced stock sometimes surpass it i will then liquidate shares back into the other stock and rinse and repeat

focused on two penny stocks in the energy sector but i wonder if this is a common strategy with blue chip stocks and if so which ones",0,"i sometimes will hear the term correlated pairs trade when discussing this sort of strategy

if you are trading different issues from the same issuer for example trading a preferred against a common from the same company that could be described as an arbitrage",this is pairs or spread trading a type of stat Arbitron Inc.

options market,stocks,"THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS","from many news media outlets and youtuber finance experts and stock gurus i keep seeing the notion that the stock market is heavily overvalued currently relative to its former valuation metrics that have held for decades 

to be honest this is true and theyre not wrong but what they fail to take into account is that until interest rates go up andor median home prices come down for the vast majority of americans there are only the following ways of avoiding poverty education becoming less and less worth it for most degrees fraud risky and makes you a piece of shit literal gambling poker which i dont classify as gambling if youre highly skilled but is not easy to be consistently profitable starting your own business  youtube  social media risky if you go all in and not definitely for everyone and investing in stocks admirable and dramatically easier than all of the above to be profitable investing in housing is a very viable way to make money but when the median home price is  this is no longer accessible to the everyday american for younger generations as a means of building wealth fuck boomers they have literally written and enacted laws that benefit them and only them throughout their lives

until investing is no longer the easy and accessible way to succeed in life for the everyday american the stock market is going to perpetually be overvalued by former metrics and dips will always have rapid recoveries   


so when people and institutions say that the market is overvalued take this with a grain of salt and when the market reaches insane valuations rest assured you can ignore this until there is another more reliable means of actually being able to fucking retire some day",2684,are stock prices going up or is money losing value,the very fact that ks are the primary retirement vehicle for the overwhelming majority of americans ensures the markets over time are guaranteed to be higher billions are pumped into the system on a monthly basis that will continue to occur,an argument can be made that its overvalued because trading and investing have become more accessible to the average american
options market,stocks,Why does pre market exist and why are options not included?,"seems pretty unfair that the market is only open from pm yet trading can still take place practically all day long it really sets you up for failure when a stock closed high but then opens at half its price i know that i can trade after hours too but seriously i cant possibly pay attention to something from ampm every day 

and why arent options tradable i am supposed to just sit there and watch my options loss all its value in PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) market but cant do anything about it if the price can change after hours why cant i tend to my options 

doesnt make sense to me",925,"mostly to concentrate liquidity

most options arent sufficiently liquid itm and otm ones even during normal open market hours with wide big ask spreads

even stocks when they trade in premarket or afterhours have bad liquidity

a stock has just a single ticker but for every stock there are maybe hundreds of options prices across strikes and all expiries

for market markers it isnt worth the trouble in non market hours for options they generally have to hedge their option positions they are selling you by immediately buyingselling stocks but the afterhour stocks market isnt liquid enough to do it efficiently 

thus providing mm activity of those hundreds of quotes for each share which themselves are illiquid isnt lucrative hence nobody demands afterhours for options

it is better to have option buyers seller concentrate their trade activities in limited market hours window than spreading it over entire day 

index futures which are way more liquid for example are allowed to trade  hours each day so it is all about liquidity","market hours those are a holdover from nonelectronic trading days its hard to change up the status quo it forces everyone to trade in the same time period and not give an advantage to hedge funds located in different time zones theres no reason this couldnt open up more but its been this way for its entire history up until about  years ago so itll take time to change

xb

after hours trading this isnt done on the same market as the market is open market its happening on what is called the ecn this system matches up buyers and sellers and is independent of the market price thats why a stock can run up or down crazy amounts after hours but when the market opens the prices in the ah dont matter  thats why they snap to the opening price ah price can affect market price but usually the volume in the ah is so low compared to the open market that it really doesnt this isnt to screw the retail trader its just the way it works

imagine you and a buddy buy a bunch of candy and after the grocery store closes you decide to sell the candy you may be able to drive the price up because the supply is low and demand is high but as soon as the store opens again the price of that candy is going to snap back to market prices

xb

options options prices are affected by the stock prices as stated above after market close the actual real price of the stock isnt moving so options prices arent moving either you selling your candy after the store closes isnt affecting the price of the candy in the store so the options you bought for that store candy isnt changing price either you cant trade options after hours because theyre in the grocery store with the candy and the store is closed thats not to screw you its just like asking why isnt my gas mileage improving when your car is off because youre not moving",isnt original poster describing the functions of regulatory bodies the hours are limited so retail doesnt get fleeced while they are asleep after a day of hard labor
options market,stocks,"Can anyone explain the theory that ""they"" (market makers/hedge funds/whoever) push a price down to avoid having to pay out for call options?","i heard a commentor somewhere mention it in passing but they didnt explain it in detail

they hypothesized that people would have calls on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) which went up a lot in the after hours last night but that today they market makershedge fundssomeone would push the price down to avoid having to pay out for those calls

can someone explain this in more depth 

also can someone who actually worked in an institutionhedge fundmarket maker verify whether they actually do this it sounds very odd is it illegal it also seems dangerous because if they think a stock should go up and they force the price down by selling tons of shares it seems like a risky gamble because what if it doesnt work and now they have even less shares

 i feel like when this idea gets brought up its always by people who have no experience working in the industry so how would they actually know it happens what if its just a conspiracy like oh the bad guys came and pushed down the price of my stock and thats why i lost money 

does anyone have links to interviews or youtube videos where industry people actually say this really happens no offense but if a person has never worked in the industry how would they know that this kind of stuff happens it would be like trusting a person with no military experience to tell you about secret strategies only people deep in the military would know",491,"i worked at a relatively large options market maker as a trader and thought i would drop my two cents here fair warning my company mostly focused on commodities and futures in the big index funds 

first ill say it plainly there was never a time where the price of an underlying was purposefully manipulated in an attempt to avoid loses from the price of the underlying at my company this has happened before and been prosecuted the most high profile case that i know of being optivers hammer manipulating the price of oil  and it is very illegal there are cases though where from an outside perspective it can appear to happen that way in options markets specifically smaller markets think oil natural gas and agricultural products  there are often large participants putting through order flow that dominates not just one market maker but all market makers inventory this type of flow is typically initiated through direct brokers to market maker connections by doing it this way the customer putting on this large position is able to get more size at a better overall price than if they had traded it electronically or thats the idea  this then causes the entire position held by mms to be relatively similar because its being dominated by this big trade  where we begin to see effects on the price of the underlying is when we approach expiration close to one of the strikes with a huge position this reduction in time and relatively small difference between inventory position and underlying price causes the gamma of the options to increase and change very quickly  with this rising gamma and the assumption that most market makers dont want to hold any position causes them to start to hedge this hedging is in a direct relationship to the gamma they hold the strange behavior starts to arise when the entire mm group is short gamma in this area the situation starts to play out like this

 price of the underlying is  mms as a whole are short a large amount of gamma from shorts on the  strike 
 the price of the underlying moves to  mm have picked up more a lot more short gamma and have accumulated negative deltas 
 mms individually decide when their delta risk has become too great and buy the underlying to hedge this risk this pushes the price of the underlying up 
 the price of the underlying is  and it is expiring in  hours mms have either hedged their delta one or multiple times driving the price up causing them to hedge more if they havent hedged they have huge short deltas more than likely dominating the risks in their book on top of this they are looking at pin risk of expiring near their short 
 mms continue to hedge through  and push the price to  this causes their short gamma to decrease and forces them to sell the shares they bought on the way up driving the price back towards  

this type of situation is amplified by a small market where futures trade thinly creating competition for the available shares now in the case that you are the luck person or even better other mm who happened to avoid the massive trade earlier and can remain long gamma in that area you get the opposite effect and get to buy on the way up and sell on the way down aka gamma scalping the bottom line is from the outside it looks like the price is being forced to a certain price but its only that way because of individual action being taken by market makers with a similar position 

hope this helps feel free to drop questions if you have them",market makers have the ability to route broker trades through the exchange they fancy securities being sold will go through lit exchanges impacting price negatively while they will route buys to dark pools that dont end up impacting the demand side of the equation they can do the opposite as well this is how market makers can suppress or pump the price of certain securities whenever they want to its in their rights,"the price of calls didnt go up the underlying went up after hours options dont trade after hours so it would be impossible for the price of the contracts to go up when the market is closed

what youre asking about is something called max pain which is the largest number of Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) on a specific strike price market makers will hedge based on certain formulas that assume possible movements in the underlying but they dont control the price theoretically the price should be based on supply and demand thats a whole different discussion though based on your understanding of atss"

hes been buying the dip on stocks that give you best  to borrow against and selling puts he mentioned he was trying to raise his margin few days ago the market continued to sell off and now hes liquidating everything hes also refinancing his property to buy in march pigs get slaughtered",he makes money from people like you viewers and followers his youtube account and other means of income probably make him more money than trading and thats how it usually works he can afford to sell and buy whenever he wants if he has large amounts of income coming in,anyone whos new to stocks dont listen to any of these guys they push their own stocks and act like they know what the markets gonna do and if they are right act like a god and if they are wrong its the markets unpredictable

my goal is not doing  in a year or buying low and selling high my goal is to outperform the index modestly at maybe  annually which would compound very nicely over decades im okay with the risk that i underperform at a modest rate i want to avoid making drastic changes to my portfolio depending on macro environment

i like stocks that are quality companies with

	a sustainable business model  high cash flow generation high roic  roce good balance sheet bonus points for recurring diversified revenue and optionality
	business model and products i understand or at least understand their value i dont think ill ever understand asmls machines but i understand why its one of a kind company
	a wide moat bonus points are for brand value network effect International Paper Company (IP) barriers to entry  high switching costs supply chain etc i am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem almost every company i own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist
	high margins i focus mostly on gross margin but consider other margin metrics too
	sustainable buybacks and dividend growth
	great management

not every company i own scores high in each of these but together they fit my investment goals very well

i used to have an allocation for growth in my portfolio but overtime i have decided to fully target quality companies and compounders with a great track record i realized that it is never too late to buy into a company once it becomes profitable and sustainable and if i miss a few baggers because of restraint from unprofitable companies ill be okay with that

if you have gone beyond that  that is a good thing but it is not the average and in the long term few investors beat the market as time goes on generally beating the market is an anomaly and hard to replicate over  and  year periods

i think as a whole investors have been spoiled by the last year the market was so awash with cash and continues to be from fed action that a monkey could throw darts at a board and make a lot of money

i make this post only to say that for newer investors those who have been investing just in the last few years dont be disappointed when your performance doesnt match that of  as far as statistical returns show us that was far and away an anomaly

i think its prudent to temper your expectations i dont mean sell i dont mean you wont beat the market in the future i just mean to say temper your expectations so that you dont become disenchanted with investing as time goes on if you beat  in your portfolio it is a good thing however expecting  growth in less than a year is only going to make you feel disappointed when your stocks dont meet that expectation

year,stocks,Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This Year,"share prices continue to plunge denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade



it is the worst year for buying the stockmarket dip since the s  

instead of rebounding after a tumble stocks have continued to fall burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale the sp  has dropped  on average this year in the week after a oneday loss of at least  according to dow jones market data that is the biggest such decline since 

the extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buythedip trade a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightningfast pandemic recovery

major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records convincing many investors that any downturn would be shortlivedand an attractive opportunity to buy

the trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the sp  down  so far in  on track for its biggest annual decline since  the selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates driving sharp swings across stock bond and currency markets all three major us stock indexes fell at least  their fourth decline of at least  in five weeks

many investors have been wrestling with high inflation a continuing war in europe and the prospect of a recession in the days ahead fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping americans behavior and the extent to which the federal reserves interestrate increases are rippling through the economy 

the volatility has been stomachchurning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) really been taking a beating said santi tafarella a yearold communitycollege professor in the lancaster calif area im uncomfortable 

mr tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock marketincluding on fridayonly to see his positions quickly sour 

other investors said they are hanging on and havent yet backed away from buying the dip trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on longterm returns at least one trend has persevered individual investors have tended to buy more shares of us stocks and exchangetraded funds on days when the sp  is down than when it is rising according to vanda research 

that includes sept  when the sp  tumbled  in its sharpest oneday fall since  individual investors bought more than  billion of us shares and exchangetraded funds that day the secondhighest total of the year they bought  million of the spdr sp  etf trust alone that day the highest oneday amount of  

us households have poured more money into us equity mutual funds and etfs than they have pulled out for the year us funds have drawn  billion of net inflows in  according to epfr global data analyzed by goldman sachs that is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market 

yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in  has evaporated a basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes tesla Suncor Energy (Inc.)amazoncom Suncor Energy (Inc.)and chip makers such as advanced micro devices Suncor Energy (Inc.)and nvidia corp has fallen  this year underperforming the broader market technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates leading to especially steep losses 

meanwhile intraday trading among individuals as defined by daily dollar volume has dropped to levels not seen since january  before the pandemic according to vanda research analysts individual traders activity in bullish call options popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years according to deutsche bank data

the frenzied frothy behavior isnt there said lule demmissie us chief executive of the brokerage etoro but that longterm thesis of investing for the long term is

some of the momentumdriven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors attempting to buy the dip in cathie woods ark innovation etf for example has been particularly painful 

on wednesday shares of the fund jumped as much as  as traders piled in hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down  this year instead the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the feds interestrate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year the rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market 

the ark etf drew  million of inflows wednesday the most for a single day since july according to factset the fund resumed its slide thursday falling  and heading toward a doubledigit decline for the week 

caleb adams an yearold university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account a type of investment account for minors said the ark fund has been one of his biggest losers 

i fell into the trap of the highgrowth highflying companies and invested money into her etfs and they have not done very well he said 

still mr adams who started investing by buying into tesla shares said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly cash he received for his highschool graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom 

mr tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the covid pandemic when he tried his hand at day trading with little success he was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans 

i started off feeling very greedy mr tafarella said i thought i can probably turn this into k within a year

since then he has shifted to a basket of diversified etfs into which he has steadily poured money 

one factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive high inflation and the feds rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade

claire de weerdt a yearold consultant and business owner based near vancouver british columbia said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market she has also parked some cash in a fixedincome investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession still she said she has no plans to sell her stocks  

i think itd be silly to sell stocks Morgan Stanley (MS) de weerdt said i dont care what the markets are like in one or two years i care what theyre like in  years



i want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year



individuals willingness to backstop markets throughout this years selloff demonstrates that the groupfor nowhas been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year helping the sp  cruise to  records and rewarding those who waded in

this current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor

also the cape is currently still at   cape is simply the way ben graham uses pe ratios in the value school of investing cape being an aggregate measure  the inverse of cape gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock marketat  aggregate rate of return is   long term average rate of return of the stock market is around  ie  ror is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return far less than   what this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market its rate of return will need to increase ie cape will have to decrease  at cape  you get the  rate of return  during the s the last time we had persistent inflation cape fell below",760,its backfiring this year if  your time horizon isless than one year,yes dont buy on the dip buy after it returns to all time highs,what wrong with buying cheaper shares if youre long you have nothing to worry about

i understand the concept of people buy price goes up people sell price goes down this is straightforward and makes sense but is not detailed enough for what i need to know

so really how is the ticker price calculated every few seconds what is the mathematical process that has to happen a friend who works in finance said he thinks its just the mean of all the bids and asks in the exchange but i was shocked he didnt know for sure

any help is greatly appreciated",250,its not a calculation  theres a bid an ask and a last price  there is a size behind all of those numbers  the last price essentially is the stock price and its just the last transaction that took place  thats why its important to consider the volume or size behind the last trades  low volume trading in premarket or after hours doesnt always translate to a corresponding move during regular hours,since everyone here is clueless the answer is you have a buysell order matching algorithm where sell and buy orders are ranked by price time and volume then the lowest sale price is matched to the highest buy price until the sell volume is filled the price at which was transacted is a weighted average of all prices,after reading some of these posts it becomes clear why so many fail in the markets

i actually like twitters current direction which is follow me because i seem like an authority then buy my productservices and i give twitter a cut

if you think elon cares about twitters revenue margins growth employee morale youre crazy hes treating twitter like his little pet toy he cares about tesla and spacex not twitter

for obvious reasons youd imagine the stock price would have dropped today

stock price,stocks,How do companies make money from stock price?,so i understand companies make money at ipo by selling a big chunk of stocks to a bank and then the bank sells those shares to the public but after that stocks go to secondary market i buy from you and you make money the brokerage makes money how does apple make money because the stock price goes up does that mean companies own their own stock,430,they use it as collateral for loans or alternatively they may pay other companies for acquisitions buyouts etc with shares instead of cash one recent example is the nvidia  softbank deal for the acquisition of arm,usually its by borrowing money against the stock price or by selling the stock they have on reserve,"the company doesnt but the board and the executives who make the decisions do as they usually have a lot of stock andor options

the only way the company makes money off the stock price is if they do a secondary offering and issue more shares but that is only done by companies that really need the money not successful companies as this dilutes the shares and is bad for the shareholders the board and the executives"
stock price,stocks,Is Amazon's stock price too expensive?,"i have many conversations with individuals who say that amazon is too expensive for them to invest in obviously this is not related to the metrics of the company but rather the fact that they dont want to fork over  for one share 

i own multiple shares of the company because i believe in what amazon is and will be in the future but all the discussions i have where people refuse to buy into the company makes me think that it loses many opportunities because of its price 

its been stated that bezos is probably keeping from a stock split because he wants to keep frequent trading by retail investors away but i believe it might lead to an increase in stock price 

if the price was lower say after a split would you be more inclined to purchase the stock

edit so peoples perception on the stock based on this post are a stock splits are stupid everyone can do fractional shares b not everyone can do fractional shares c yes it is expensive and therefore stupid to buy d the stock is great the price is undervalued and i wish i could buy more",91,id like to add that fractional shares are a lot like instagram to boomers they just dont do it and even people i know in their early s refuse to buy a stock if its price is too expensive even though they have the option of fractional shares,"in terms of value id consider Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) a great buy the pe has stayed within its long term range so it hasnt bubbled like so many other stocks furthermore its traded sideways for quite a while and will likely take a big leap in the nottoodistant future

when the stock hits  or  questions of whether  is expensive will be painful to reflect on

furthermore the company has so much potential to grow theyre in cloud theyre in streaming whats next  amazon banking amazon mortgages i see london has an amazon supermarket now  i personally believe theyll be the largest company in the world in the next few years

if youre more reflecting on the cost per share that shouldnt matter with fractionals and is probably all the more reason to buy now when they do eventually announce a split you want to already be in",id absolutely buy a ton of amazon if it was lower

for example i was talking with someone the other day about copper stocks specifically scco i was arguing its in a dip and a strong buy someone else pointed out the very valid reasons that the price is down heshe was very polite about it and gave me an alternative view to consider

disclaimer i originally created this tool for wsb but it looks like i am muted there for some reason so i figured i would share on some other subs where people are also talking about Gamestop Corporation (GME)

this whole experience has been and will be a crazy trip but you dont want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth have an exit strategy everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance some of us can afford to you only live once away sixfigure investments while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand

your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing and how much profits you would be happy taking im not here to tell you what your strategy should be but i did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself 

xb

how to use the exit strategy planner

 note  this is for shares only im not smart enough to make this work for options

 note  the link i provided is read only so the first step is to make a copy for your own use file  make a copy

 now enter your current position provide the number of shares you have in a and your average cost basis in b these cells are highlighted in yellow your total investment will automatically calculate in c

 columns ef are the roi calculator column f tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the roi listed in column e column g tells you what your total value would be at that share price

 columns ik are your breakeven analysis which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling x number of your shares and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price you will probably want to adjust the s in column i based on how many shares you currently have in your position columns j  k will automatically update when you do

 columns mn calculate your profits at different share prices how much money will you make if you sell when Gamestop Corporation (GME) hits  what about  or  or even  these columns will tell you feel free to adjust the share prices in column m if you want but i have most of the big milestones covered

 columns pr are your exit strategy planner you will need to provide the following information  of shares if any you want to hold long term postsqueeze cell p maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing q profit amount you would be  happy cashing out with no fear of missing out of future gains r cell q will calculate your worst case scenario sell price set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses to the amount you entered in q while still holding your desired  of longterm shares cell q will calculate your best case scenario sell price set a limit order at this price to cash out with your  satisfied profit you entered in r while still holding your desired  of longterm shares

 columns Grupo Televisa S.A. (TV) is an incremental sales planner some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit ie sell  shares when it hits  another  at  etc simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point column u and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues net profit and remaining shares

too long; didn't read use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on Gamestop Corporation (GME) when all of the shorts are officially squeezed make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and riskreward preferences

of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments but lets be honest half of us seem to be all in on Gamestop Corporation (GME) right now big week ahead may all of our profits be plentiful

edit a few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy fear not i have made some alternate sheets you can use instead they are all the same",5196,"temporarily locking this post and will unlock later today

strategy,stocks,Warren Buffet's stock strategy is more relevant now than ever.,"over the last couple of weeks there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growthtech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to reopening or value plays the key take away here has to be this

if a  drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock you should have never bought that stock in the first place

contrary to popular belief stocks do not always go up in fact most stocks fail to beat the market in the longterm with few exceptions buffet makes this clear a good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year or because it has shown growth in the past it is only a good buy if it has value beyond a shortterm horizon and most importantly if you buy at the right price if you had bought ge at its peak a company that is invested in all aspects of life and wont ever disappear you would be down nearly  why is this is ge a bad company with bad products or a shrinking customer base no you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable 

think of this scenario you are the owner of a snack shop summer is coming up so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream after all people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days right this cant possibly bad investment so you go to your supplier and he offers you a price of  per pint of icecream what would you do would you buy just because icecream is guaranteed to sell in the future no not unless customers were willing to pay more than  per pint

conversely your nextdoor competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate this is ridiculous to you who would buy hot chocolate in the summer however your neighbor buys in at  per cup of hot chocolate for his supply once summer is over you sell out of your inventory but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than  a pint then winter comes and guess who profits more

the point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one if your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit you did not believe in the price in the first place if this scares you enough you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise there is nothing wrong with that picking stocks is hard and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top 

my two cents is this lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd and calling companies like amazon and microsoft growth stocks is disingenuous if you lump in palantir and tesla in that same category the market right now is doing just that however in the sense that highpe growth stocks like tesla are dropping alongside with apple in my opinion all this is doing in the longrun is that you are buying triedandtrue blue chips at a discount 

kohls is not going to be larger in  years than it is now and its price now does not make it a good buy  conversely just because tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a pe of  is a wise investment reopening plays are just market chatter cruise lines have tremendous debt banks are tied to riskycredit loans and government regulation and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel just because they are outperforming now does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the longterm

buy into valuable companies future growth good price at a discount ignore shortterm market sentiment and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks",2824,warren buffets portfolio is a freighter its big slow but always moving forward and hard to stop everyone else is looking for rocketships sure some get to the moon but many blow up on the launch pad,not hard to hold but its very strange to see a several thousand dollar loss each and every day for weeks on end mondays are the only green i see very discouraging going to take months to get back to even thats after averaging down,"i dont get the buy into re opening chatter

the time to do that was  months ago not now unless you can still find some industries and companies that havent rebounded i think re opening is starting to get priced in Carnival Corporation (CCL) is up  since i initially bought in and probably wont see returns to PartnerRe Ltd.

strategy,stocks,Easy trading strategy.,"disclaimer im dumb

when a company pays dividends the stock usally drops the same amount on the xday the owners will get the money like  weeks after the day the xday
lets say a company pays a  dividens so the stock drops  on the xday 
wouldnt it make sense to buy it right there because the stock should go up later when the owners gets the dividens and reinvests it is this already priced in


edit i came looking for confirmation bias but found real advice not happy this subreddit gets a",347,just try it out and tell us your experience,little known secret is that you can actually profit by doing this with any stock even if they dont pay dividends by buying it when it goes down and selling it when it goes up,if the company yields  and pays quarterly the dividend will be  also assuming a stock does not fluctuate randomly and is perfectly priced relative to its dividend its value will gradually increase until the next dividend date then drop again so its not like it would drop  then go back up   if they were paying  a quarter that  would accumulate over the course of the three months
strategy,stocks,I Interviewed 20 Leading Wealth Management Firms: Here Are All Their Strategies,"i sold a company i created and after the press release went out i was inundated with very gracious offers to take and manage my new found money for fees at the time i presumed these wealth managers after managing hundreds of millions  if not billions  of other peoples money for decades would have developed advanced strategies and tactics for ensuring success surely they would have teams of analysts scouring the markets for opportunities technical indicators news events macroeconomic data and breakthrough innovations at all times to stay a step ahead of the pack i was dead wrong

what i discovered was an antiquated industry that relied heavily on the belief that they knew better and were on top of things in fact there was very little effort that went into managing opm other peoples money and that most of the energy went to finding and onboarding new clients

im not saying that their strategies were bad or didnt work i am only stating that they were neither complicated nor impressive in short anyone here could repeat the same strategies and save  of their money a year in perpetuity without further ado heres what i learned

goldman sachs

its important to note that there are various divisions within Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) (GS) wealth management that handle money differently i break it down into low net worth midnet worth and high net worth offerings the low net worth folks are given marcus an automated investment system that simply relies on etfs paired with some basic bond funds its the same as buying vanguard target retirement funds

the midnet worth offering is where i spent the bulk of time understanding they find  stocks to invest in from different sectors with an attempt to represent the sector weighting of the sp  as the spx is largely tech they are overweight technology basically they take the spy and cut it down from  companies to  companies

why would they offer a less diverse array of stocks

they state as the reason that they are better able to manage  investments than  and since they are not trying to beat the returns of the index  their words  theyd rather find stocks with lower beta volatility and thus likely lower returns

they locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within the sp  once per quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments they target a  annual return after accounting for their  fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over a certain amount of money invested with them  this amounts to  per year for a m portfolio for many years  a lot of money to part with

did i mention you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them unless you happen to already own one of the  stocks they pick so there are tax consequences of getting involved

for the hnw folks the above offering is available and they offer additional products such as the ability to invest in private equity reits and hedge funds as you might imagine the more money they manage the more free accounting services they include

personal capital

this may actually be my favorite given the simplicity of it they take the main sector etfs and eliminate any stocks that are losing money to recreate their own etfs by sector they charge you a fee to use their etfs

they start with an equal amount of capital going to each sector etf but allocate more money to the sectors with the worst performance record from the year before they do this annually they do nothing all year

they charge a fee for managing your money i recall it being  or  basis points but you have to also pay to use their etfs so it creeps towards the better part of a percentage point very quickly and is much more expensive than simply buying a vanguard sp   fund or a group of the sector etfs calling it quits

ritholtz wealth management

if youve watched cnbc regularly youd recognize the commentator josh brown  a partner of ritholtz wealth management hes the one with the thick new york city accent when i found out i may have the chance to have his insights managing my money i was excited as he always seemed so knowledgeable but the wealth management shop was not impressive

in fact their model was exactly the same as that of goldman sachs they pick about  stocks stick your money in them rotate them every quarter and keep volatility low on the stocks they pick they target  annually net of fees yes you heard that correctly 

the next group of wealth management shops all fell into one of three other categories spy collars etf aggregators or tactical investors

spy collars

this strategy involved putting all of your money into the spy etf then selling call options on that investment out of the money a few months out at a time they take the income from the sale of these options and purchase out of the money puts on the spy for similar expiration dates this strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside for those who are not used to options heres how it works

lets say the spy is trading at  you own it you sell someone else the right to buy it from you for  for  per call so long as the spy stays under  the other person will not execute the call and you get to keep the money for the call premium if the spy goes above  you have to either sell your shares at  plus pocket the  per call option premium making this a sale at  or buy the call back at a higher price than what you sold it for youd lose money on the call but the spy shares have gained in value so you still come out ahead you are just not as ahead as you would be had you simply bought and held the spy all the way to  this creates a ceiling in terms of the max amount you can obtain on the upside of your investment

the option puts work the other way protecting your investment on the way down since you used the premium collected on the sale of the call to buy the puts you havent spent any new money but have bought yourself insurance if the spy drops the value of your put option a short on your own investment increases this increase offsets your losses protecting you especially in the case of extreme correction

if the spy rises you lose the value of your put so you have to account for that in your net income for the investment

if you dont follow this dont worry the net effect is they use options to prevent a major loss but in doing so they also prevent you from having any major gains you are trapped or collared within an acceptable range of returns over time you will not beat the sp  index with this strategy and they say this

so there is only value to this strategy if you simply are unwilling to trade a really bad year once in a while for a great year once in a while its mostly about your investment time horizon and whether you need regular access to the money

etf and mutual fund aggregators

about  firms i interviewed used this strategy i heard the same thing so often i thought maybe they were dumbing it down for me essentially they just bought all sector etfs or a basket of mutual funds for you a few of the firms would use the collars i spoke of above if the market got a little choppy but most did not

this strategy was most common with smaller wealth management shops  under m aum  which tried to differentiate themselves as financial planners that happen to look after your money the bulk of them did very very little to watch the market and most flat out stated they only looked at these quarterly

i could not understand what they did all day until one referred to himself as a market psychologist because his job was to calm clients down when the market shits itself i have vodka for that so this strategy was not for me

tactical firms

these firms were harder to find and their Genentech, Inc. (DNA) was more similar to day traders in terms of their mentality they invested in a basket of stocks they thought represented a blend of value growth and good dividends they chose them annually but were much more likely to liquidate and go to cash if they thought a correction was coming so they had cash to buy the dip

one thing i did learn from them though was tax loss harvesting  a term for specifically taking losses on investments to offset gains on others

the best way they did this was by rolling calls on equities that had risen in value imagine holding apple stock and selling a call on it if apple goes up you must then choose to sell the stock or buy the call back at a higher price for a loss if you do the latter in year  and sell a second option in year  at the same price or more than the call you bought back you can write off the loss in year  while avoiding actual losses

you can roll calls like this forever amassing paper losses while you actually gain in the value of the underlying equity it was a nice trick iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) used many times now especially when i want to sell something iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) held for years with significant gains

their desire to protect the portfolio i felt prevented them from participating in the quick rebounds in the market in  when i spoke to them they felt a crash was imminent and had gone to  cash in their portfolio i never reached back out to see how they did but i suspect they were buying the dips in march 

their overall returns were around  but not as good as simply buying the spy and holding but they did seem to be able to minimize the downside of some on major events

in the end i never hired any of them i decided instead to use what i learned and what i knew and manage my own money in case you read this far and are curious yes my returns have beaten all these firms average returns and iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) actually learned a lot in the process sharing in case anyone could use the strategies",4769,"one way to look at all these firms is that their primary job is not to make money but to avoid losing it  their clients would be happier with lower returns if they can say that they have lower downside risk 

which is fair if i had a few million or more id  be a lot less willing to you only live once my entire life savings on the market if i did not know how it worked  great post and very informative",private wealth management firms dont really help you investment your money in the sense that they have some secret sauce to beat the market that is what investment managers are for a private wealth firm should really be helping you with you estate goals not generating alpha you use them to help you set up trust wills tax planning etc of course almost all of them offer investment products but anyone who can beat the market will work at a hedge fund and not a private wealth shop,so in summary  just buy spy

strategy,stocks,Why simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing 3 decades of market data to find best DCA Strategy,"by now we have all heard the virtues of dollarcost averaging dca and that you should never try to time the market basically it has been repeated ad nauseam that

time in the market beats timing the market

but what is interesting is that i could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollarcost averaging

theoretically there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hardearned money once a month into spy right

so in this weeks analysis we will explore various methods to do dca and see which one would end up giving you the best returns

 

analysis

given that dollarcost averaging is about holding investments longterm we need data lots and lots of data for this i have pulled the adjusted daily closing price  shiller pe ratio of spy for the last  years 

now we have to devise different methods to do the dollarcost averaging that will maximize our longterm return we will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles all of them would be investing the same amount   every month but following different strategies

average joe invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending this would be our benchmark

cautious charlie invests in the market only if the price to earnings ratio  is lesser than the last year rolling average else will hold treasurybills 

balanced barry invests in the market only if the price to earnings ratio is within   of the last year rolling average else will hold tbills

analyst alan invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last alltime high else will hold tbills 

given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment i have considered the starting point to be st jan  so the analysis is based on someone who invested  every month since  in all the above strategies we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied ie in the case of cautious charlie he will keep on accumulating tbills every month if the pe ratio is not within his set limit once its below the limit he will convert all the tbills and invest them into spy 



results

based on the time period of our analysis we would have invested a total amount of  till now

return comparison  different dca strategies 

investment strategyportfolio investment strategy

average joe
analyst alan   drop
analyst alan   drop
balanced barry
analyst alan   drop
analyst alan   drop
cautious charlie

 

no matter what strategy we use the most amount of returns were made by the average joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending a close second was analyst alan who accumulated money in tbills and only invested when the market dropped more than  from its alltime high

the least amount of returns were generated by cautious charlie who only invested if the pe ratio was lesser than the last year average basically by trying to avoid overvalued rallies he ended up missing on all the gains followed by the analyst alan persona who waited for a  drop from ath before investing



limitations

there are some limitations to the analysis

a tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis both of these would adversely affect the overall returns

b since i am only using the monthly data for the pe ratio and my spy investments due to data constraints a much more complicated strategy involving intramonth price changes might have a better chance of beating the market at the same time making it more difficult to execute

c while we have analyzed the trends using the last  years worth of spy data the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say   or even  years

 

conclusion

i started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month i also checked for various time frames   years and various endpoints just before the covid crash after the crash before jpow etc in none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average joe in the total returns

since this is an optimization problem i am  in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive riskadjusted marketbeating returns

 

footnotes

 the data was obtained from yahoo finance api and longtermtrendsnet while the pe ratio was available for the last  years the daily closing of spy was limited to  years

 we are using the shiller pe ratio  this ratio divides the price of the sp  index by the average inflationadjusted earnings of the previous  years this solves for the brief period in  when the normal pe ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis

 we are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the tbonds

 the  cutoff is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends

 the idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (JP) morgan which stated that  of the best days in the market happened within  days of the worst ones",1436,how about leveraged larry who borrows an amount equal to future contributions invests that money now and gradually pays down the loan with what would have been the future contributions a la the lifecycle investing book,"nice job on this now can you calculate gains for someone whose investment strategy consists of fear of missing out buying and panic selling only to rebuy for a loss when it goes back up of course

asking for a friend","hey its unobjos back with this weeks analysis do let me know if you have any better strategies before you jump to comment about lumpsum investing having better returns it assumes that you have enough money at the beginning of investing period to put in a lump sum amount which is not the case for most of us

trading,stocks,This killed day trading for me..,"i havent told hardly anyone this because it kills me to think about  i had started day trading paper stocks i was reading day trading books by reputable day traders watching live youtube traders and actually was doing pretty good in  year i had turned the original  paper money i started with into  it was like i couldnt lose for every red day i had  green days i was doing everything by the book and it was really working  
   
   so not having any money i took out a personal loan for k put k in the bank and k into my day trading platform i was so confident in myself that i laughed when the loan guy told me  years at  i told him id pay it off in full within  months 

   now in day trading they teach you to look for a catalyst a reason why a stock will go up they also teach you to set a stop loss at no more than  so you dont lose everything if it drops well i started day trading for real and was doing only ok i would make  dollars then lose  dollars lose  then make  i was about  red days and green days my k was down to about  after a week then it happened  i read a stock twit at am about a small company that just had their product approved to sell on amazon i looked it up and it was true i told myself i would buy k worth when i looked up the price it was only  a share

   the bell rings and i buy like  shares it instantly goes up about  percent and im getting excited then literally as im setting my stop loss not even  minutes into the session it drops alot below where my stop was gonna be set im down  so im like well shit i go to set another stop but it falls so fast that i cant set it in time im down  then  then  and im freaking out i finally set a stop and it sells immediately for a  dollar loss this was the first  minutes of the session over the next  minutes it dropped to  a share i thought well at least i got out before it went that low upset and confused about why it would fall so low on positive news i ieft to work i had about a  min drive and decided about  mins into it to check on that stock it was  a share the app for the particular platform at the time was only for checking stocks i could not perform any buysell action from the app and i was driving to work i checked again  mins later it was at  a share i got to the supply house about  mins later and checked while i was waiting on parts  a share i couldnt stop watching it all day so when the market closed and it was at  a share i literally felt sick the next day it fell a bit early but then ended at  dollars 

   over the next two weeks it had massive swings but hit a high of  dollars a share now i dont know if i would have held it to that point but i beat myself up for months thinking i lost  dollars when i could have made k it completely killed my spirit i started sucking at my trades it only took a few months and another almost k in losses for me to lose all motivation and pull out my  bucks i had left and put it in a different stock trading account close my day trading account and completely lose all confidence in my ability to day trade

   they say  of day traders claim a loss at the end of the year i guess i was part of that statistic i went from being on cloud  with my paper account for a year just slaying the market to being completely shut down in just a few months every time someone brings up yo man you still doing the day trading thing i just lie and tell them no i dont have enough time to dedicate to it anymore but really i think of the perfect trade that i knew would go up that i sold for a loss and unable to do anything i watched it go up  and it still makes me physically queasy this was  years ago i am what they call in the business an emotional trader just thinking of day trading for real money now actually gives me anxiety thanks for reading my story  true by the way nothing in this is made up or exaggerated real prices real time frames i just cant remember the ticker 
 
   it ended up falling to about  or  dollars a share over the next year and yes i watched it for the next year but k into k in one day would have been great k into k the next day would have been better  turning it into k would have been life changing for me at that time but i think what hurts the most is that i found that obscure twit i did the research i truly believed it would go up i knew it would go up then i panic sold my perfect trade that was truly perfect thats worse than losing the money


edit ok so i found the stock tickeri was able to log into my tc account from my browser and look at my trade history it was obln i had trouble finding a chart for it for some reason but i did find one the prices are totally different than what they were that day they must have had some splits or reverse splits or something 

   i also got a couple details wrong i didnt buy  shares that was actually a different stock i yolod my whole  dollars and bought  shares at  each on may   another detail i got wrong it wasnt almost  years ago it was almost  years ago i sold  minutes later at  a share it wasnt a  dollar loss it was a  dollar loss according to the only chart i could find that recognized the ticker symbol on may   it opened at  hit a high of  a low of  and closed at  a share exactly the same as the open totally different than what my trade history says there are some other weird things about this stock besides having trouble finding a chart on tc it is now listed as oblnold also my trade history is wonky and not correct i bought all those shares watched it drop and sold them then watched the price skyrocket for the rest of the day according to tc i bought  shares at  which is correct but then it says i sold them all  minutes later for  this is not correct it also shows me buying  shares the next day at  then selling   minutes later for  then selling the other   minutes after that for  none of that happened i never traded it a second day i bought at  then sold a few minutes later at either  or  it was one transaction on one day tc was always a little funky and i grew to not like it all im sure since the chart and my numbers do not match there will still be people saying im lying or this is fake or whatever if those people would like i can send them screen shots of my buy at  on the same day that the chart says it was  i wish it matched but i currently have both up on my computer and i can send them i dont understand it either but i found the ticker yea",2007,biggest mistake was trading money that wasnt yours that makes your trades much more emotional,stocktwits is manipulative pump garbage stay off of there and find another source of leads,"if you sold at the top and netted k it probably would have stoked your confidence and made you more comfortable taking on even riskier behavior and exposing yourself to even greater downsides  just some food for thought  lack of sustainability is a key feature of day trading

tesla stock advanced  to  wednesday during market trade with tesla model  vehicles going for as low as  on the companys website 

tesla is officially saying the model  starts at  after the  ira tax credit meanwhile reports circulated early wednesday that tesla has agreed in principle with a plan to set up a manufacturing plant in india teslas website recently stated that the base model  vehicle was eligible for the full  tax credit under the ira the model previously only qualified at the  level tesla has not disclosed how it brought the model  into alignment with ira requirements for the full tax credit meanwhile the irs made the official change to its site tuesday morning it announced all model  and model y vehicles qualify for the  tax credit

the biden administration said on march  that vehicles eligible for the full  tax credit must have batteries with specific quantities of components manufactured in north america and critical minerals sourced in the us or from certain countries

vehicles that meet only one of the critical minerals or battery components requirements are eligible for a  tax credit at the time the base rearwheeldrive model  with its battery from china did not qualify for the full tax credit

underlying stock price,stocks,Facebook/Meta price move shows that no individual stock is 100% safe,"its a lesson that everyone who invests in individual stocks should keep at the back of his mind microsoft google amazon and facebook have been praised on here for many years as stocks that will  outperform the overall market with relative safety its very possible that meta will grow for years to come and the stock will recover but at this exact moment

 facebook has returned  over the past  years  not bad but below the  for sp  and the   for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) despite the fact that holding a single stock is significantly riskier than holding the index
 the price has been cut almost in half from its ath 
 it is trading at its lowest ps and pe ratios ever the stock is cheap now the pe ratio will return to historical levels doesnt always work out 

again not to say that facebook is a bad business or the stock wont recover but if it was a big part of your position youre probably not doing too well right now it just highlights that market dominance over decades is exceedingly difficult there will eventually come a time when microsoft apple tesla and google underperform start stagnating missing earnings and decrease in value if you invest in individual companies you should make sure that you are willing to stomach that risk",1021,i see the hindsight gang is here,i dunno while its true no stock is  safe i wouldnt say facebook was among the safest given all the controversy over privacy,it makes me feel super uncomfortable whenever people say stuff like apple is my savings account

do i own  of underlying stock

or it is possible that the etf has a value that is much higher than the actual stock

for example i buy for  of an etf but that corresponds only to  of actual stock

is there any way o ensure that there isnt too much difference between the direct ownership of the stocks and being part of an etf",84,deleted,compare the Navistar International Corporation (NAV) of the etf to the price  thats how you know if you are overpaying or not for the underlying assets but the difference is generally not that significant because market makers will react to correct it when it happens,"etfs have convertability which means certain traders can exchange the basket of stocks that make up the etf for shares of the etf or vice versa
this creates an arbitrage opportunity that keeps the etf close in price to its underlying stocks  thus the price will vary slightly but tend to come into line as market participants take advantage of this"
underlying stock price,stocks,AT&T's stock is sinking under the weight of future litigation over toxic lead cables - The telco's stock hit a 30-year-low,"att stock closed at its lowest price in  years on july  following a series of downgrades in the aftermath of a wall street journal investigation into toxic lead cables

shares of us telecommunications giants like att have been falling since the july  report revealed that abandoned leadsheathed cables that have been contaminating soil and water sources in the us analysts have been raising red flags about telco stocks anticipating legal and reputational damage from the wsj report to grow and persist",739,its crazy how poorly managed the major telcos are in the us they wasted so much money in the past  years trying to owncontrol the content instead of investing in their core business and networks think about it what exactly was stopping att comcast or verizon from being major players in cloud infrastructure they made their bets on stupid shit like dish network warner media direct Grupo Televisa S.A. (TV) aol and yahoo wasting billions in shareholder value along the way they tried so hard to break into the content game at a time where the market was diversifying and the margins had immense downward pressure then they tired to use old tactics such as long term contracts that limit consumer choice to protect market share not understanding the shift in the market att is the prime example of a company with the boomer mentality,they should say something about ai to get their stock back on track,took  years of litigation before sherwinwilliams had to pay a fraction for the lead paint issue i honestly doubt the us would allow their telecom infrastructure to be completely hobbled and unable to update an already outdated infrastructure
underlying stock price,stocks,"If the price of underlying assets rise, does the price of an ETF like VTI also rises?","for example if someone wants to buy a million shares of apple or nvidia right now the demand for apple or nvidia stock goes up and therefore so should apples and nvidias stock prices  
in this case what would happen with the price of Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) will its value also rise due to the above 

if this is correct then why schd has outperformed Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) since inception knowing that most assets in schd are value oriented while vtis are growth oriented  
thanks in advance",20,yes thats the point,"schd has outperformed Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) because the underlying stocks have outperformed 

why

well value doesnt mean it wont grow and growth doesnt mean it will growth typically just means more of the current price is based on future growth expectations and future earning potential rather than present earning potential but most of that growth is priced in so if they perform any worse than expected even if they still grow significantly the stock is likely to go down similarly a value stock trading at x cash flow can repurchase  of their shares per year thus the stock price would increase  per year if the market cap stays constant leading to outperformance 

this is why i hate the growth and value stocks labels newbies assume that cause its called growth its a better long term investment and bound to outperform long term all good investing is value investing and that doesnt mean just buying value stocks  growth stocks can be undervalued too","in an efficient market with a large enough etf yes

etfs have a creation and redemption mechanism that keeps the value of the etf and the underlying basket at the same value

for Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) specifically yes it will be a fair price 

if you go to etfcometf symbol on the page they will show the history of the etfs price relative to the basket a price sold higher than the basket is a premium and below is a discount

this will give you an indication of how fair the etf is on average historically

now that you understand the holdings dictate the value then yes better etfs will occur because the underlying holding did better in the period reviewed"

do they lower prices too to try and compete making an even bigger loss or rely on their own brand loyalty for people to pay their asking price to minimise their losses

the article

bloomberg  russia defaulted on its foreigncurrency sovereign debt for the first time in a century the culmination of evertougher western sanctions that shut down payment routes to overseas creditors  

for months the country found paths around the penalties imposed after the kremlins invasion of ukraine but at the end of the day on sunday the grace period on about  million of snared interest payments due may  expired a deadline considered an event of default if missed

with the final deadline passed focus shifts to what investors do next

they dont need to act immediately and may choose to monitor the progress of the war in the hope that sanctions are eventually softened time may be on their side the claims only become void three years on from the payment date according to the bond documents 

most bondholders will keep the waitandsee approach takahide kiuchi an economist at nomura research institute in tokyo

its a very very rare thing where a government that otherwise has the means is forced by an external government into default said hassan malik senior sovereign analyst at loomis sayles  company lp its going to be one of the big watershed defaults in history",2673,"hi youre on rstocks please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being offtopicpolitical feel free to edit it now and be more specific

time,stocks,Gasoline prices top $5 a gallon nationally for the first time and are likely headed higher,"the average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose above  nationally for the first time due to increased demand from the economy reopening from the pandemic and depleted oil supplies stemming in part from the war in ukraine

prices look set to continue rising into the summer months analysts said

the average national price reached  on saturday thats up from about  a year ago and a record price not adjusted for inflation at the end of the week prices had already averaged  or more in about  states with the highest prices on the west coast

by my calculations the typical household is spending about  more on gas a month than a year ago said mark zandi chief economist at moodys analytics thats a big bite

gasoline prices normally peak in midmay but this year they have continued to rise and the average price is about  cents higher than a month ago due to short supplies this year analysts are forecasting that prices may not top out until midjuly when summer driving season traditionally peaks

i dont think were far away from the highest prices said patrick dehaan head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy i dont think it would eclipse  i would say  is the top but again the market is unhinged

however if there are any serious refinery outages this summer or disruptions from hurricanes gasoline prices could spike he added

gasoline is in shorter supply than normal because the us has lost about  million barrels a day of refining capacity since before the pandemic at the same time sanctions on russian energy has sent oil prices sharply higher and created tight supplies of both oil and fuel globally

analysts say while consumers are feeling pain at the pump the price of fueling a car with gasoline is not as big a part of a households spending as it had been in the past that is in part due to more efficient vehicles

according to a cnbc analysis drivers were spending an estimated average  cents per mile on gasoline as of june this year even with the steep price increases in  that same mile would have cost  cents in todays dollars",6817,i just paid  for gallon here in europe today these gas prices really suck,"guys just dont drive problem solved

time,stocks,Oil stocks - the time is now,"hello there

i posted about  about defense being undervalued and theyve climbed  since then besides hii which completely whiffed earnings hope you hopped on now i am now starting to see value in the oil sectors the june high and subsequent recrash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up with covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now i present my case for a break in those ranges

there are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI)

 new covid cases in the us have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend  globally it seems to be seesawing in a confined range
  potentially  million barrels 
 after flooding the us market with  they have now cut exports to a 
 the dual storms in the gulf have caused a lot of 
 after stalling in july air traffic is starting to  and routes are being added again although still way way down

which all support W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI) prices in the coming weeks should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online which will add to the inventory how much i am not sure you can see from  that we added  rigs but are still down a net of  rigs from last year next we can take a look at the  for some more insight into what current inventories are like

 m barrels of crude  above average peak was m barrels on june th
 m barrels of gasoline  above average peak was before covid due to build over the winter
 m barrels of distillates  above average peak was m barrels on july st
 refinery inputs at m barrels low was m barrels on may th 
 refinery rates at  at the low on april nd it was at  normally around 
 W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI) is trading in the  range with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the spring

the last several eia reports have been good in general  drawing down of products with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down 

whats my point here the takeaway should be this the worst is over and it seems were about halfway recovered now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving

right now cyclicals have been beaten down to earths core as tech goes up and up cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and i expect a rotation at some point strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines covid cases going down and a general resumption of normal any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well

worried about a democratic administration unlike the defense stocks i had previously looked at i think its a real issue for this industry the democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations its weird that big tech has been climbing  companies like amazon apple facebook etc that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a tax bill fear from the dems closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits i havent seen any hints of this in the market so i am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors environmental regulations should be however

however i still believe these low valuations are still too low even with headwinds some of the majors have already been adjusting shell in particular and refineries like valero already have strong renewable fuels segments phillips  recently announced plans to build the 

what am i looking at in particular

right now refineries have the best value to me psx is criminally undervalued with a safe dividend Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) is another that is set for strong performance mpc has a strong position after its speedway asset sale but i would rank psxvlompc at this point for value

 psx target price  sitting currently at 
 Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) target price  sitting currently at 

from a producer standpoint ChevronTexaco Corporation (CVX) and cop are both fundamentally solid i prefer cop at this point rds is the closest its been to its covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil its been beaten down since losing its dividend but i can only assume it will be back im not a fan of Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) going forward but right now its at the low of the range its been confined in and wouldnt be a bad temporary pickup fang  EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG)  Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) arent bad pickups either

ps  stay away from oxy its very clear theyre going to continue to issue shares until theyre through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved it was popular for a while not sure how its still viewed just stay away

too long; didn't read buy refineries and the producers worth buying that arent drowning in debt or have terrible assets

disclosure i have a large position in psx calls",2173,i traded oil for too many years mostly unsuccessful   just remember it always does the opposite of what you think its going to do  its ran and manipulated by opec a literal cartel  you think the price is going down  next day nigerian rebels come to blow up a pipeline and create a shortage  you think the price is going up because of demand  nope because we just turned on  rigs to pump more  its an endless game and very hard to make consistent gains  oil does not trade like any other sector  be careful out there and best of luck,"its crazy how a well thought out post like this gets nothing but hate on this sub but some dude posting should i buy tesla at  will get hundreds of upvotes and two dozen comments saying yea Brown & Brown, Inc.

stock market crash,stocks,Ok so you think a Market Crash is coming. Paint a picture of how it happens and the near term fallout.,with so many crosswinds its hard not to imagine that a market crash is possible im curious what this crash would actually look like for the market and the us economy how long would it take to really take hold what could daytoday life look like for americans how long could it last how much pain is possible,0,no one knows obviously but i think its a scenario similar to september  qqq to  and bounce the market doesnt really have anything left to rally on at the moment in my opinion,"powell fails to contain inflation Brunswick Corporation (BC) it is structural due to demographics and the real estate cycle and underinvestment in commodities he eventually is forced to pivot or pause due to treasury market dysfunction the one thing that could be more important than the dual mandate inflation roars but sp doesnt crash in nominal terms but instead climbs while slowly going down in inflation adjusted terms but the general public might not necessarily notice Brunswick Corporation (BC) it lives in a nominal dollar world

either that or commercial real estate or bank of japan cause a quick crash that can be recovered from through the slashing of interest rates

i have no idea how likely either scenario is or if they are even the most likely bear cases but that is what i can think of","not a crash  a drawnout bear

first the zombie companies start failing because their business models are broken  this causes layoffs then the viable but overleveraged companies start to fail as their lowinterest debt matures at significantly higher rates  more layoffs

then consumers start realizing that eating and paying the mortgage are more important than shelling out for a  phone or k  k for an Eaton Vance Corporation (EV)  the magnificent  earnings start to fall  more layoffs

then laidoff workers stop making rentmortgage and car payments cars are repossessed  tenants are evicted mortgages are foreclosed layoffs at car dealerships management companies and real estate brokerages

multigenerational or blended families sharing a single house or apartment become common taking in boarders to make ends meet becomes common for families with spare bedrooms a single car shared among multiple adults becomes common maybe no car if most work from home

laidoff family members provide child care cooking and cleaning services for room and board layoffs at daycares restaurants and maid agencies

the economy which is  consumer spending shrinks debts are defaulted on  collateral gets marked to market  asset prices fall

or if too many banks are in jeopardy the fed steps in

the fed takes mortgages that are in default and swaps them for us treasuries at book value same for auto loans in default no collateral is marked to market  the price of the average us singlefamily home increases to  million the price of the average car to 

interest rates are lowered to zero so that the laidoff workers can still buy iphones heck maybe negative to create a huge incentive to spend  people start taking out loans to finance their over consumption hoping for the eventual debt jubilee

maybe congress authorizes another round of fiscal stimulus

the economy picks up again the sp hits  but it might as well be called the sp with alsorans"

s first half was the worst half to a stock market year in the last  years this saw the sp  move down from  to  this is a range of  of this range an ideal fibonacci retracement bear market shortterm rally would be  back up in this range that takes us  up from  which gives  yesterdays high was  this high was within  error of the ideal  fibonacci retracement

thus the  week simple moving average of the sp as a further catalyst for resistance will reject the sp down thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue

that said the first half of  was the worst in  years the third quarter was one of the best and the fourth quarter may end up being the worst stock market quarter on record here is a visual

 both the  week simple moving average and the completed  fibonacci retracement are now serving as the catalyst to resistreject the sp thereby allowing for the continuation of s worst market downturn of all time

 is just as bad in this case the price is rejected by the  day sma

 crashlike margin deleveraging

fibonacci of this graph shows that margin has to collapse up to  billion more from augusts expected margin value depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging

finra margin totals adjusted for monthbymonth inflation dotcom crash left bubble  crash and great recession middle bubble and the current bubble right fibonacci retracement values are listed for  and  of each deleveraging period one can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding  seems to correspond to slow and weak and  seems to correspond to fast and strong the data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash

options,stocks,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them

first and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options

there are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised

 

now the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information

as for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price

 

i know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario

whether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay

time decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay

time decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches

theta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support

 

although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling

the reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post

regardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time

maybe after this youll see why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns

hope this was helpful let me know what ya think",1862,so one of the main reasons to trade options is to be given the opportunity to trade with leverage,"great post by the original poster one aspect he did not touch on is the fact that all the pieces that go into the value of an option act like exponential curves why is this important to understand

lets start with theta or time value theta decay is not linear if we compare an april and july option of the same strike the value of the option will drop more tomorrow in the april option than it will in the july option in fact there is virtually no theta decay in the july option right now theta decay really becomes important to consider  days before expiration

in my trading i prefer to trade in options  days out it will cost me more to own that theta but it also gives me the chance to change my mind in the first few weeks without losing theta value this is a more conservative approach i use options to generate small incremental returns or to add some profit opportunity to core positions when i think a news item might move the stock sharply

the next variable to consider is called delta  this variable measures the rate of change expected in the option relative to the underlying stock price if i buy a  strike call on a stock trading at  the option should rise  for each  rise in the stock  this is called delta  in the industry the one is shorthand for  or   the option price change will reflect  of the stock price change delta  means  optimally you want an option that goes from delta  or  to delta  with  days left before expiration you get the benefit of the share price move and preserve some theta value you can recapture in the sale  unfortunately there are no freely available tools that will tell you the delta of a particular option without them you have to just feel it out but a good rule of thumb is a  differential is roughly delta  and a  differential is probably delta  ie the option is not going to budge much even if the stock moves 

you will get the most out of an option if you can play those periods where the delta is increasing rapidly take that  stock again lets buy a call option with a  strike price if the stock goes to  the option will not move much as the stock rises more the option will react more this is how you can make a very high rate of return on options that  strike premium will make the option quite cheap maybe a  depending on the other variable if the stock gets to  that option is probably close to  triple your money

the last important variable is vol short for volatility a stock that has large frequent swings is more likely to hit any given strike price than a slowmoving stock traders price the options differently as a result in bull markets general stock market vol declines which generally means that individual stock vol declines as well on average but if markets start behaving dramatically stock option values increase as this vol becomes more valuable this is why having some puts in your portfolio after strong bull markets might make sense puts increase in prices as stocks fall and as vol increases its a double payday

the value of an option is largely the sum of these three variables theta is a cost you have to just accept the higher the delta in an option the less risk you have of losing everything at the cost of muchreduced upside since changes in vol are very hard to predict it is really just a bonus if you catch it",public service announcement this post is missing a lot of key pieces to options trading

these are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation  someone trying to increase net worth not increase income  and they may not be suitable for everyone

understand the trading environment

one mistake i made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment i was in before picking out a strategy what do i mean i need to know where things are in the year in relation to earnings season and in relation to sector rotations i need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and i need to watch the vix

mind the gap between earnings seasons i cant stress this enough when earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in investors watch those like hawks good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market 

in between earnings seasons there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation year bond yields and what the fed is doing this makes for a much jumpier market thats more likely to pull back  its also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios they manage billions so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class eg value stocks energy and underweight in other asset classes eg growth stocks technology

i try not to get caught by these patterns i anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly simply put i buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule of course i dont do this if i expect a terrible earnings season 

take advantage of sector rotations

the sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year i do this by plotting sector etfs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside if i run the pe ratios for the sector etfs i can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over  pe vs other sectors that are more modestly valued just keep in mind that certain sectors like tech will always be valued more richly given their growth so looking at pe ratios is not apples to apples  its just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range

last years worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year this is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high i dont bet against this trend its been around longer than i have and will continue to be around long after im dirt 

last year you couldnt give away a barrel of oil last week oil reached  a barrel 

one of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector etfs that underperformed the previous year i buy calls with expirations in  months knowing that i will sell at my exit point which for me is a  gain sometimes this happens  weeks into the year other times it takes  months so long as i dont overpay for the options it works i dont like to pay more than the average price return of the sector for example if the sector etf averages a  annual return and the etf price is  im not going to buy a call for more than  that way if the sector only moves  i can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough

make the vix your friend

the vix is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks if the vix goes up the market is worried if it goes down the market is getting bullish if it stays up everyone is on edge its hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button so be careful buying during times when the vix is high on the flip side if the market has pulled back and the vix starts to retreat away from its highs that makes for a good entry point 

another interesting phenomenon is when the vix is higher than normal there tends to be a selloff the friday before a long weekend this happens because investors dont want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their tuesday with losses piling up iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day friday or to run some weekly puts on thursday afternoon before the dips 

selecting trades  investments

have an allocation plan

the first thing i recommend is determining in advance the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies anything shorter term is higher risk higher reward i break my portfolio in the following buckets

  longterm market investment using equity etfs that largely track the spx or do a breakdown between bonds and the market i use vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called calf i will not touch this money for  years
  cash i like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare this way if a black swan event happens i not only have money to invest i have money to live on should things go bad for a while this philosophy enabled me to buy options when covid hit in  without worrying if i could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job its also very useful if i have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions i took this from buffet fwiw
  options mostly in tax advantaged accounts iras i aim for a  annual return overall with this portfolio though it fluctuates a lot year to year
  long term blue chips stocks like visa apple Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) etc i defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them andor buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur that can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls 
  longterm bets in a roth ira these are equities i think all have a chance at a x return but that will take  years its a lot of ipos small tech companies and biotechs i have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of  on the belief that a few of the  in here will more than compensate for it this is a new strategy for me so ill let you know in  years if it works
  leveraged hedgesthese are puts on my own positions stocks or the market at large generally i use vix calls buy puts occasionally buy calls on the spxs and run strangles on investments betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts  
  in other things i cant mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe

use technologies to find ideas

unless you want to spend  hours a day reading news or are ok getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends you need to use tools to help you locate investmenttrade ideas and be willing to pay for them i value my time and am willing to pay  of my portfolio a year if it saves me time and more if it generates higher returns 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried about a dozen or so services including stock picking services like fool and investorsplace ultimately i decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because i did not want to wait  years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps so i switched to analytics tools and my fidelity platform 

my favorite tools to use are zacks vgm score levelfields and fidelity the zacks vgm measures a stocks value growth rate and momentum its an easy screen i can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at the caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved  of the way they are going to move so you need to keep an eye on whats new to the list to avoid losing money that part is crucial 

the list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next  months warning they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit i use fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price

a friend recently turned me on to an ai tool called levelfields they have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically it helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to midcap companies you dont usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites they often send alerts on company events before theres any news out which is really helpful the interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen so its easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success   
i use it a lot for pinpointing entryexit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies i hadnt ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings not sure why but they never came up in any of my fidelity stock screens i suspect its because theres a lag in the data fidelity is getting from sp but havent confirmed this they send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that theyd have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so i didnt have to look up the stocks on fidelity

i use fidelity for basic news reading running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations looking deeply at the history of earnings results actually trading options and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity  i sell puts when i see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a midpoint in its week price range in case it shoots up and then down i always set an automated exit

fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options i use when selling puts it tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range i use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk i do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like Gamestop Corporation (GME) and tsla my typical goal is to make  a week from these plays which i use to fund new call positions

be wary of analyst opinions

if youve invested actively for a while youve likely noticed a peculiar trend as a stock is cratering analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it this is not for your benefit brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts so there is inherent bias in the system 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings they are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks one study found less than  issued sell recommendations whats more the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping cnbc has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms eg goldman sachs says these  stocks are ready to explode but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right 

i am embarrassed to say i lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality its easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if  analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect which is tradable but it boils down to needing to do your own research

good things come in pairs

just about every stock has a peer or competitor most have several i stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) owned visa and mastercard i own olo and tost i have a handful of um herbal medicine providers i like etsy and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) if you bet on a small group of competitors its likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially 

similarly it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy what do i mean if mastercard reports low cross border transactions its highly probable visa will be experiencing the same thing so you can use the information from mastercard to alter your position on visa

exercise financial discipline

even when iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been successful picking investments iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) run into problems with how to handle my successes weve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go thats usually the moment iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned i should be taking some gains a few rules i try hard to follow but still screw up

 take profits often   
when an option or stock hits  return i look to take some profit it may not seem possible if you only bought  call but it is just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return you can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up this ensures you cannot lose money my rationale here is simple at a  gain i now have more to lose than i have to gain you will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up  then down to  on the same positions which makes me want to break things  
if you find yourself up huge on an equity investment switch to options i did this for my baba position and it saved me when it hit  i was up  i sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares i had about k in stock and switched to something like k in options when baba crashed down to  i really didnt care much i was only down k instead of k i had my profit of k locked in so being down k was no big deal  

 fail fast   
if the option price sinks to  in value its likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to praying is not a strategy the other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as i wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date if theres negative news driving this im out i want to fail quickly that allows me time to take the remaining  and generate gains with it on a better investment i think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as i tend to be an optimist  

 profit both ways   
if a stock i hold hits an alltime high in price or valuation i look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts this enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave i hold visa and when it hit  headed into earnings i sold  calls and bought  puts this offset a paper loss for me of k yesterday alone by k in gains which i secured as real profits assuming visa will recover that k adds  to this years returns for visa  

 be patient but not greedy   
i have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea especially if using good tools asset managers wealth managers and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every  months not daily so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness example i held upstart from april to august this year and sold it because it was running flat a couple weeks later the stock tripled fml were the only words i could think of at the time the second thought i had was that i shouldve bought just one call option to replace the stock i sold  
on the flip side once a stock does move a lot higher dont be greedy what goes up fast can come down just as fast i feel a lot worse watching a stockoption go up  then come down all the way or more than i do exiting with a  gain watching the stock go up more dont chase the perfect trade its a white whale just make money  

 everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth   
this is as true in boxing thanks mike as it is investing thats why its essential to have a plan a and a plan b should plan a not work out as you thought waiting through it can work but it isnt a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment   
so if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising covid rates and covid rates stop rising i try to have plan b ready i keep a lot of notes i track every trade i review what went wrong with trades quarterly i learn i avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest i try not to fall in love with any stock and i know that even if i lose k theres more money to be made in the coming years and decades if i stick it out",7844,and you started with k,"great post but an important question seems how much you started with

market,stocks,Amazon Becomes World’s First Public Company to Lose $1 Trillion in Market Value,"amazoncom Suncor Energy (Inc.)is the worlds first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year 

shares in the ecommerce and cloud company fell  on wednesday pushing its market value to about  billion from a record close at  trillion on july  amazon and microsoft corp were neckandneck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone with the windows software maker close behind after having lost  billion from a november  peak 

while technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector the top five us technology companies by revenue have seen nearly  trillion in market value evaporate this year 
the ecommerce giant has shed  trillion in market value
  
the worlds largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in ecommerce growth as shoppers resumed prepandemic habits its shares have fallen almost  amid slowing sales soaring costs and a jump in interest rates since the start of the year cofounder jeff bezos has seen his fortune dwindle by about  billion to  billion according to data compiled by bloomberg

last month amazon projected the slowest revenue growth for a holiday quarter in the companys history as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty that sent its market value below  trillion for the first time since the pandemicfueled rally in tech stocks more than two years ago",1943,so reversed the pandemic rally,what the absolute i bet they rally in the end,its all imaginary value so no biggie
market,stocks,"Can't make sense of this market, so I'm still doing nothing","i dont know what the f is going on anymore  heres whats running around my head at the moment

 markets sold off before the election on the apparent theory that it was looking to be closecontested and the markets dont like uncertainty
 markets rebounded in the days leading up to the election as it started looking better for a clear biden win
 election is incredibly close and contested government will likely be split and yet the markets are rallying super hard  the prevailing theory is that a biden win with republican senate will make it less likely that biden will attack big tech and increase taxes
 in spite of  a split government will also make it more difficult to pass a stimulus package which increases the likelihood of a doubledip recession
 covid still spiking but nobody seems to care anymore which makes it more powerful as a potential risk  if the numbers keep spiking eventually that will lead to one of two headlines that people really wont like hospitals getting overwhelmed andor increasing lockdowns  the latter will be much more likely to happen under biden than trump
 the rally today seems broader but there were some real breadth concerns yesterday  breadth indicators like the tick and nyad were flat yesterday  this suggests the rally is being driven primarily by a certain segment of the market big tech and not an everything is great pile into the markets sentiment
 the ridiculously sharp rally over the past few days has made it extremely difficult to find good entry points on anything  stocks have gone from pullback to megaoverbought in  days  major indices are more extended beyond their day emas than since late nov  shortly before the markets plummeted to major lows
 iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned several valuable lessons over my years of investing that all seem to be coming into conflict right now i time in the market is better than timing the market ii think long term and focus on weekly charts iii dont make emotional reactionary decisions iv dont get caught up in fear of missing out v dont invest based on what you think the market will do or what you want it to do but on what its actually doing

given that i cant make sense of all this right now im sitting on my hands  at the very least im going to see how this week plays out",1311,it seems every day people forget the market couldnt fucking care less whats going on,"overvalued i will buy when the dip happens
dip happened but i dont want to catch the falling knife

market,stocks,Some words of advice for those who are entering stock market for the first time.,"if you are a first time investor especially a young investor it is very easy to fall in the trap of buying the stock that your friend relative or a stranger on internet recommended just because someone made  gains on something doesnt mean you are going to make that

remember that the faster any asset climbs up the faster it comes down like a house of cards if it had no resistance going up there is no support going down and when such stocks crack they fall through the roof in a matter of hours not even days

nowadays you get Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) on youtube every  seconds with someone shouting in your face with so called their magic formula where their students make  every trade dont fall for these snake oil salesman if making money were that easy nobody would work their ass off for years just to buy a house or a car

pick up a book and learn the basics of finance fundamentals will help you get a handle of how to start valuing a company while technical charts play a role in short to medium term movements of the stock long term is always going to be based on fundamentals watch peter lynchs videos on youtube he is an old school investor just like warren buffett but has some really good food for thoughts in his videos

needless to say if you are investing in crpto be extremely conservative  of your portfolio is too much anything more than that and you lose your hard earned savings very quickly if things go south

i understand there is a euphoria when you make quick money but derivatives like futures and options are sure shot way of getting screwed if you dont know what you are doing everyone has an itch to make a lot of money in a short period of time but trust me losing your original investment is one the worst feeling you can ever have if you earned that money by working hard

if you dont know anything at all about investing and want to start putting some money into an investment account buy a broad market based etf like spy or qqq on a regular basis think month time in the market is always going to beat timing the market

lastly as warren buffett said  rule  never lose money and rule  never forget rule 

too long; didn't read dont invest blindly in stocks that some friendstranger recommended you efforts to make money quickly on stocks crpto or derivatives futures and options without understanding the fundamentals and risks will make you lose your hard earned money and your shirt if you dont know anything about investing buy broad market based etf like spy and qqq on a regular basis",936,"very well written and important advise for those starting out in the markets

if i may add there is a fundamental difference between investing and trading which i think is not emphasized enough to people who are just beginning  it scares me to think that these guys or gals in their teens have  to trade   and not invest",my advice buy low sell high,im  now and a good  months ago during the dogecoin craze i thought it would be fun to dabble in it and try to make a return after almost dying of stress for a few days and yoloing the money loads i luckily made an  return since then just been cruising with etfs cause i never want to feel that stress again laughing my ass off

market,stocks,How to profit from a market crash,"hello first post here

say i think the market is going to drop over the next  months how would you gamble your money to best profit from that is there a specific company you would short because they stand to drop the most and the premium on the short is the lowest

any advice is really appreciated

edit a big thank you to this community for taking the time to educate me i think by putting crash in the title i triggered a lot of people saying short instead of puts also seemed to trigger a lot of people 

i am sorry to waste your time i think if i wrote it like this it would have gone over better

just theoretically if you were a long term bull investor but one day you thought there was going to be an event that would cause the market to pull back  and you thought it might happen in the next  months how would you invest that money so you are risking the least but stand to make the most from it

the conclusion from the comments suggest puts on inverse etfs but because the period of time is  months then just buy the inverse etf but in the end you are stupid for even considering this 

thanks rstocks you are a great",435,go cash and buy the dip when it happens will be the most sensible,deleted,i would forget about shorting and focus on picking up really good companies at really good prices  prepare beforehand  make a list of companies  these dont have to be growth companies a slower grower at a fantastic price can result in growth stocklike returns until the stock comes up to fair value and the slower growers are usually less risky   calculate the intrinsic values of the companies then come up with dream prices that will give you fantastic returns  wait  during the crash use limit orders to capture an extreme inter day price  maybe you get lucky with a few of the companies  the stocks you do buy are good for above average returns for at least a few years and maybe they turn into long term holds

price,stocks,Ford CEO Jim Farley says Tesla price cuts could start an EV price war,"ford CNOOC Limited (CEO) jim farley said teslas price cuts could spark an electricvehicle price war and transform some into commodities

price wars are breaking out everywhere farley said whos going to blink for growth

teslas price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share but the strategy has cost the company

on wednesday the automaker logged revenue of  billion which was roughly in line with estimates according to refinitiv but its profits took a hit as net income plummeted  yearonyear to  billion during the three months ending march 

seth goldstein an equities strategist for morningstar told insider teslas price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling he said ford which previously predicted its Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) business would keep losing money until at least  was faced with the potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more

that makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond goldstein said

share price,stocks,TESLA will Cyber Truck sell well and move share price to a new all time high?,"have to be honest with you i dont currently have a position in tesla but i am intrigued about what im hearing regarding the release of the cyber truck evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits along with a backlog of  orders waiting to be filled with a late  or early  release date  
according to this article that is a fiveyear backlog  

tesla cybertruck orders surpass  million  year wait times 

there are now over  million orders for the longawaited tesla cybertruck per a crowdsourced data tracker speaking on an earnings call earlier this week tesla CNOOC Limited (CEO) elon musk stated that demand for the cybertruck is so off the hook you cant even see the hook

given that tesla plans to produce  cybertrucks a year at peak capacity new orders will technically take around  years to arrive 

it seems to me that tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to  per share  i dont see it going much lower than  

recent history
 week history  low and  high",0,would be impossible not to look like an ass driving one it looks like homer simpson designed it,no all that matters is fsd they still look decades away,no look around there so many new vehicles coming out that qualifies for tax credits it may reach a new ath but not because of releasing new vehicles
share price,stocks,"Robinhood IPO Prices at $38 a Share; at the low end of expectations, after the popular trading platform met tepid demand","robinhood markets Suncor Energy (Inc.)priced its initial public offering at  a share at the low end of expectations after the popular trading platform met tepid demand for its highly anticipated debut

the price chosen by the company and its underwriters is at the bottom of the range of  to  a share they had been targeting it pegs robinhoods valuation at about  billion far higher than the nearly  billion it fetched in a funding round a year ago but below the lofty prior expectations of some investors and bankers

robinhood has said it and some executives would sell  million shares so the offering should yield more than  billion

the price reflects both hesitation on the part of some investors who bristled at what they saw as the high valuation robinhood sought as well as a conscious decision by the company and its underwriters to be conservative in order to help set up a successful firstday of trading according to people familiar with the matter

next up for robinhood is its trading debut which the company will make thursday on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) stock exchange under the symbol hood it is a markedly different debut than the traditional ipo while most companies only allocate a small amount of stock to individual investors at the time of their ipos robinhood sold a big chunk of its ipo shares to individual investors over its new platform that gives users access to ipos before they start trading

that high individual investor allocation is an x factor for thursdays debut the large chunk in the hands of individual investorsas well as the buzz around robinhood by other individual investors who didnt receive shares in the iporepresents a wildcard and some traders at banks that underwrite big ipos say it is hard to predict how that will impact the stock at the open

robinhoods decision earlier this year to stop users from buying meme stocks like gamestop corp Gamestop Corporation (GME)  during the height of the frenzy for such shares rankled some investors and could prompt some to eschew the offering

past ipos in which a significant percentage of shares were allocated to individual investors have struggled in  facebook Suncor Energy (Inc.)fb  sold about  of its ipo to individual investors the stock closed slightly above its  ipo price in a rocky first day of trading before tumbling the next day in part because many individual investors received more stock than they wanted it took more than a year for facebook to close above its ipo price again in  vonage holdings corp vg  allowed longtime customers to buy into its ipo its stock also wobbled in early trading

the robinhood listing is another landmark in a historic boom in ipos as a rising stock market and hearty investor appetite entice a slew of successful private companies to shift to public ownership some  companies are going public each week this year according to dealogic traditional ipos had raised more than  billion as of tuesday on the cusp of surpassing all of  and  as the biggest year ever for uslisted ipos

in the nearly seven years since it launched its app robinhood has gone from a tiny startup to one of the largest us retail brokerages the firm which popularized zerocommission trades says its mission is to democratize investing it is a philosophy robinhood reinforced saturday by hosting a livestreamed roadshow presentation for individual investors

as of the end of june the firm had  million funded accounts and its users held about  billion of assets on the robinhood platform

the company went viral earlier this year when millions of amateur investors downloaded its app to participate in the explosive rally in meme stocks like gamestop the breakout moment nearly broke robinhood as the company had to restrict purchases of some highflying stocks and raise billions of dollars in emergency capital to meet regulatory requirements that kicked in because of the increased trading volumes

robinhood bounced back and continued to attract new users but more recently it flagged that its growth is slowing the company said in a securities filing last week that it expects its thirdquarter revenue to fall relative to the second quarter partially due to decreased trading activity

its popularity has brought increased regulatory scrutiny too in the past nine months the company has agreed to pay more than  million to settle investigations into a range of its business practices there could be more on the way robinhood disclosed this week that it got a new request for information from wall streets selfregulatory body finra",1940,back in january you could hear matthew mcconaughey saying this little maneuver is gonna cost us  billion dollars,do not short it  i assume theyre gonna get pumped up and get people liquidated,their support is a joke they never respond to user inquiries b is overpriced

stock,stocks,Shouldn't the Nvidia stock be skyrocketing?,"gamer here live in a basement play games  dont have money dont own stocks

but i do know what the stock market is

so here is my question why on earth isnt the nvidia stock going up and up until there is quite literally not enough money in any investors pocket anymore to buy another share

do the people with money not understand whats going on nvidia has  competition and every single one of the richest people on earth is buying as many gpus as they can probably paying doubletriple to get their hardware delivered first this is happening right now as we speak

sooooooo  uhm  do only people that game  actually get what the ai revolution entails isnt it obvious are nerds with  years of experience in their field the only people that can actually tell whats happening like do i have to be a hobby pilot for  years to see when a revolutionary invention is happening in the aerospace industry is everyone else blind to that im confused do people always think they are being tricked when it comes to stocks you could have had a nerdy friend working in machine learning and he could have told you everything thats going down now back in 

if i understand this correctly then the only reason nvidia stock isnt rising every week is because people think they are being tricked by nerdy gamers

xb

update alright thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts really appreciate it to wrap up heres a summary of the reasons why nvidia stock isnt continually rising

 people only trust their own eyes which i think is fair i could sit here forever explaining how the ai revolution will play out and people would still wait until they can actually feel the impact themselves for example in the next  weeks chatgpt will roll out an image creator a large amount of normies will absolutely love that feature normie subs to chatgpt  normie loves it  normie understands nvidia hardware is driving it  normie invests  stock rises thats the only way it happens no reddit post can compete with that
 supply nvidia just can not keep up with the orders the demand is wayyy higher than the supply and this isnt changing anytime soon takes forever to build these factories
 ursula got wind of the numbers nvidia is crankin out and is preparing a  billion fine for being smarter than the competition

(AMD) nvidia and apple the delays and difficulties in its transition to the nanometer and nanometer chip manufacturing processes and the rising costs and supply chain disruptions caused by the global semiconductor shortage however intel is also trying to improve its situation by investing in its own chip fabrication plants and expanding its foundry services to other customers launching new products and platforms such as alder lake sapphire rapids and arc and acquiring or partnering with other companies such as mobileye sifive and globalfoundries these moves could help intel increase its revenue and margins boost its performance and competitiveness and enhance its capabilities and diversify its portfolio in the areas of autonomous driving artificial intelligence and advanced chip manufacturing so is  even worth it buying and holding onto stock or is it better avoiding buying all together",355,how heavy are your bags,their financial performance is worse it appears in gaap statements they switched from  year to  year depreciation schedules for major semi equipment this year  the idea is that their foundry services will increase useful life of the equipment  of course the foundry services havent done much yet  in the meantime its decreased depreciation expense by b per quarter this year  using last years depreciation schedule theyve lost about b from operations so far this year,"is the first part chatgpt and the final sentence your own im just curious if i can spot the writing style

stock market prices,stocks,Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market,"i along with probably many others here are new to the trading world Gamestop Corporation (GME) sparked our interest but we know this isnt how the market usually works with that being said iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so i figured id share some basic info here to try and help some others

here is a very basic explanation of the different indicators i have got i guess some of you already have in your charts

  this gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading their risk factor is also improved through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market  
  this finds the position of a security within bollinger bands b is simply a percentage measure of a securitys location between the bands b can be lower than  or higher than  if price moves outside the bands generally speaking a b near or above  can suggest an overbought market while a value near or below  can indicate an oversold market

  are used in technical analysis to measure a markets volatility it is a banded indicator similar to bollinger bands b besides measuring a markets volatility donchian channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overboughtoversold conditions when price reaches either the upper or lower band these instances would indicate possible trading signals

  this is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment like a stock or commodity over time the ema is a type of weighted moving average wma that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data

  a collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels as well as momentum and trend direction it does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart it also uses these figures to compute a cloud which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future

  a banded indicator similar to bollinger bands and moving average envelopes they consist of an upper envelope above a middle line as well as a lower envelope below the middle line the middle line is a moving average of price over a userdefined time period either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used the upper and lower envelopes user defined are set a range away from the middle line this can be a multiple of the daily highlow range or more commonly a multiple of the average true range

trade,stocks,What $GME has taught me in 36 hours of day trading,"jumped on the Gamestop Corporation (GME) bandwagon on friday    my  hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out i will never you only live once on a bubble ever again

the principle seemed straightforward hedge funds got lazygreedy overshorted their positions bet against a company that wasnt actually going under and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market the basic premise makes sense but the devils in the details and hype is blinding

first red flag was when i realized  did not bet on the short squeeze he bet on undervalued stock price over a year ago he has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze he walks away with  figures so the people screaming if hes still in im still in and look at those brass balls if he can lose mm in a day then i can hold are really living up to the dumb ape meme he didnt lose mm yesterday he lost mm in unrealized gains there is a huge difference

second red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds wont go down without a fight and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience you dont get that without learning how to game the system in complex subtle ways so even if they are still heavily shorted which they might not even be anymore and even if somehow  is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them that doesnt rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about

but even in the off chance that somehow this turns around and Gamestop Corporation (GME) does go to the moon that doesnt change the fact that its bad longterm strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons they almost certainly fail and if they dont they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble im still holding my shares but i dont expect to see my  ever again in the off chance i break even or see a profit here i will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains

edit holy shit rip my inbox no way i can read all that

want to clarify a few things not financial advice

my position i knew i was late to the party i wanted to gamble i knew what i was doing and mostly why i did it hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than i wanted to admit but still im not surprised by the outcome so far and im totally ok with taking the l and calling it a lesson learned i dont blame dfv wsb or anyone for my choices i own them even proudly because i wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss im holding because i already bought my tickets to this ride want to see this thing play out and im fine with gambling the final  on the outside chance things turn around

your positions brothers sisters nonbinary siblings you are not your portfolio whether up or down your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is you are a human being on the bleeding edge of  billion years of evolution you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than youll ever know  years ago i was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on  steel reserve i hit my bottom joined aa and now im a network engineer wife kids the whole lot anything is possible if you dont give up on yourself but i know its not that easy we all need borrowed selfesteem before we can see the real value inside so if this Gamestop Corporation (GME) gamble hit you hard please reach out to someone dont give up hell this bubble isnt even over it might even turn around but either way dont give up

wow never expected this to go this far wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation read a ton of replies probably missed most of them thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween a few more points

 agreed that rh deserves to be held accountable no question they manipulated this
 agreed its not over yet the squeeze could happen but if it does my main personal takeaway from this experience will stand i wont speculate on bubbles anymore this is my position if i lose everything or make k
 if you posted gains thats awesome so glad for you i wish you the best

edit 

full disclosure i closed my position this morning at a  realized loss

my gut says the squeeze happened short interest isnt what i thought it was on friday and the stock will return to actual value soon

i stand by my decisions both to buy and to sell i dont speculate on bubbles period but you can do whatever the fuck you want with your money and youll never find me shaming you about it",26721,"unlike most  i actually watched most of dfvs videos he was never bettering on the short squeeze  he was campaigning for Gamestop Corporation (GME) being around for much longer

wsb was shitting all over him when he was posting his losses up until he started making great profit thats when they all started calling him their god","another good lesson that you performed is to never invest more than you can afford to lose especially on a risky play by going in with just    its easier to look at things from a more objective lens and not fall prey to the hopes hypes and hysteria when the price swings big

trade,stocks,Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,"hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers actions a wall street journal investigation found

thousands of officials across the governments executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made a wall street journal investigation has found

more than  officials at agencies from the commerce department to the treasury department during both republican and democratic administrations disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies that amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across  federal agencies reviewed by the journal

a top official at the environmental protection agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks the food and drug administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its nobuy list a defense department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the pentagon

the journal obtained and analyzed more than  financialdisclosure forms for about  senior career employees political staff and presidential appointees the review spans  through  and includes data on about  financial assets and more than  trades reported in stocks bonds and funds by the officials their spouses or dependent children

the vast majority of the disclosure forms arent available online or readily accessible the review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executivebranch officials who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy


among the journals findings

 while the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies more than  federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks meta platforms Suncor Energy (Inc.) facebook alphabet Suncor Energy (Inc.) google apple Suncor Energy (Inc.)and amazoncom inc

 more than five dozen officials at five agencies including the federal trade commission and the justice department reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions such as charges and settlements against those companies

 more than  senior epa officials nearly one in three reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency epa employees and their family members collectively owned between  and nearly  million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between  and 

 at the defense department officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between  million and  million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the journal some held stock in chinese companies while the us was considering blacklisting the companies

 about  federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading with some individual trades valued at between  million and  million in all the forms revealed more than  trades of stocks during the sixyear period reviewed

 when financial holdings caused a conflict the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules in most instances identified by the journal ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agencys work
number of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks 

federal agency officials many of them unknown to the public wield immense power and influence over things that impact the daytoday lives of everyday americans such as public health and food safety diplomatic relations and regulating trade said don fox an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the us agency that oversees conflictofinterest rules

he said many of the examples in the journal analysis clearly violate the spirit behind the law which is to maintain the publics confidence in the integrity of the government

some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading but such trades still can create conflicts under the law the buck stops with the official said kathleen clark a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the washington dc government its the official who could benefit or be harmed that can occur regardless of who made the trade

investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest the rules were tightened in  by the stop trading on congressional knowledge stock act passed following a series of journal articles on congressional trading abuses

journal reporting last year on federal judges revealing that more than  jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest led to a law passed this may requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make

this article launches a journal series on the financial holdings of senior executivebranch employees and in some instances conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms

us law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances additional regulations adopted in  direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest

the  ethics in government act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income assets and loans the financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges

a view of washington dc

most officials financial disclosures are public only upon request the journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency

some made it difficult to obtain the forms and several agencies havent turned over all of them the department of homeland security hasnt provided any financial records see an accompanying article on methodology

under federal regulations investments of  or less in individual stocks arent considered potential conflicts nor are holdings of  or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry the law doesnt restrict investing in diversified funds

some federal officials especially those at the most senior levels sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict

the office of government ethics which oversees the conflictofinterest rules across the executive branch is committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government said a spokeswoman she said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies

at the epa an official named michael molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while mr molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy epa administrator according to agency records such companies stood to benefit from former president donald trumps pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects

mr molinas job gave him a frontrow seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy he reviews and coordinates sensitive reports documents and other materials said his job description provided by the epa in response to a publicrecords request he served as a personal and confidential representative of the epa deputy administrator in communications with the white house and congress according to the job description

in the month he started the job may  mr molina reported purchases totaling between  and  of stock in cheniere energy Suncor Energy (Inc.)a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas he reported adding cheniere stock five additional times over the next year at the time senior epa officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the us

reported trades in energy and mining firms

made by spouse through a financial adviser

the trades were made through a financial adviser in his husbands account according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the journal mr molina was required to enter the trades into the epas electronicdisclosure system within  days of receiving notice of the transactions under the  stock act

officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings dont conflict with their work regardless of whether they use a financial adviser the journals review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks

in an interview on sept  mr molina indicated that he didnt know much about the energy trades i can say this on the record i didnt even know what cheniere was until  hours ago he said

in february  mr molina was promoted to epa deputy chief of staff he attended scores of meetings on environmental issues reviewed matters for the thenhead of the agency andrew wheeler and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings according to records reviewed by the journal and people familiar with the matter

in about  years at the epa mr molina reported more than  trades in energy and mining companies including duke energy corp nextera energy Suncor Energy (Inc.)and BP p.l.c. (BP) plc about  of the transactions were for between  and  each according to mr molinas disclosures those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser

in the month he was promoted february  his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in cheniere and williams cos which builds and operates naturalgas pipelines

two months later mr trump said the epa would propose new rules to help the gas industry

after publication of this article mr molina said in a written statement neither i nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account and these same trades were made on behalf of a pool of several dozen clientsnot for us individually

mr molina left the epa in january  an epa spokeswoman said the agencys ethics office counseled mr molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations epa officials signed mr molinas financialdisclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflictofinterest rules

us law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflictofinterest law the federal energy regulatory commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas interstate oil pipeline utility and other energy firms

the epa doesnt have additional agencywide rules a spokeswoman for the epa said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they arent working on policies that could affect their investments mr molinas boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters

greg zacharias was the chief scientist for the defense departments director of operational test and evaluation until last fall he repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the pentagon announced it would pay the company  billion to deliver more f combat jets while his division was overseeing testing of those planes

mr zacharias made five purchases of lockheed martin corp stock collectively worth  in august and september  according to figures he provided on sept   the defense department said it was buying  f jets from lockheed for the air force and marine corps lockheed shares closed up  the next trading day the stock made up a small part of mr zachariass portfolio

mr zachariass office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets and testing officials regularly met with the pentagons f joint program office and with lockheed directly according to former defense officials mr zacharias who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems didnt attend those meetings

in an interview mr zacharias said he wasnt involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract beyond the public information that the pentagon remained committed to the f program he acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems i could always walk downstairs and ask them how its going but that really wasnt an interest of mine he said adding that his focus was emerging technologies

mr zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors including lockheed because of their dominance of the defense market he said he didnt pay much attention to the timing of trades adding im just the pipesmoking science guy

the lockheed investments were among more than  trades mr zacharias reported in about a halfdozen defense contractors in  and  according to the journals analysis

i apologize that things dont look good on the buy side mr zacharias added of the trades in defense contractors he said i just decided that would be a good investment at the time

he said ethics officials didnt raise concerns about his trades in lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies he said ethics rules could be a little tighter

a pentagon spokeswoman said mr zacharias worked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications she said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials ethics officials certified that he complied with the law

some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies misunderstanding of their own rules

the fda prohibits employees their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are significantly regulated by the agency the fda maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check

an fda official named malcolm bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about  pharmaceutical diagnostics medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in  and  including drug giants pfizer Suncor Energy (Inc.)and takeda pharmaceutical company Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD) all were on the prohibited list

mr bertoni a career executive ran the fdas planning office from  to  researching and analyzing agency programs most of the investments he reported were in the range of  to  but his  disclosure showed he and his wife owned between  and  in each of allergan plc sanofi sa takeda and zoetis inc

mr bertonis lawyer charles borden said mr bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the fda ethics office

the stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of mr bertoni or his wife the attorney said he said that years ago mr bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds

they did not the ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of mr bertonis forms in early  mr borden said the fdas office of ethics and integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to mr bertoni the attorney said in an email

after considering the tax and retirementplanning consequences of having to sell the stocks and other personal factors mr bertoni chose to retire instead his lawyer said

an fda spokesman said mr bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his familys holdings in them the spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure

the fda takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made and actions taken by the agency and its employees are not nor appear to be tainted by any question of conflict of interest said the spokesman

when federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities they often receive light punishment if any according to records reviewed by the journal

valerie hardymahoney a lawyer who runs the national labor relations boards oakland califbased regional office held tesla Suncor Energy (Inc.)shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and chief executive elon musk and considered whether to file more

members of the labor relations board appointed by the president review decisions made by agency administrative courts Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts she is a career employee who joined the nlrb in the s

Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoneys office filed complaints against tesla in  and  she reported holding tesla shares worth  to  in  while those cases were ongoing the next year her disclosure form shows she owned tesla shares valued at between  and  in etrade accounts she purchased two chunks of tesla stock in august  each valued at between  and  according to her disclosure form

the nlrb ruled in march  that tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that mr musk in a tweet had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized it ordered tesla to reinstate the employee and mr musk to delete the tweet tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court

Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoneys office has in other cases rejected charges against tesla filed by employees including allegations her office received in  after she bought more tesla stock according to an nlrb case docket an employee who worked at the tesla gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers rights Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoneys office dismissed the charge in january 

last november an nlrb ethics official declined to certify that Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations according to her disclosure form

the nlrbs inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest an agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoney

the report said that the matter was referred to the local us attorneys office but that federal prosecutors declined to take it the report said the subject of the reportms hardymahoneyreceived additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed

Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoney declined to comment she recused herself from tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflictofinterest rules the nlrb spokeswoman said

at the federal reserve an economist named min wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses a fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Morgan Stanley (MS) weis husband

in june  fed chairman jerome powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank in a very very difficult position even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana mr powell said he just would love to see a clear policy on the matter

because mr powell didnt dismiss the idea investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as tilray brands Suncor Energy (Inc.)a leading producer tilray went public the following month and its stock skyrocketed

in early september  Morgan Stanley (MS) weis husband bought between  and  million of tilray shares according to her disclosure form and the fed the stock continued to surge

it then became clear that neither the fed nor the treasury would take action it would be up to congress with no quick fix in sight in october shares of cannabis companies began to fall

Morgan Stanley (MS) weis husband sold his tilray stake in five sales in early october by then the shares had nearly doubled worth between  and  million according to Morgan Stanley (MS) weis disclosure

the fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents fed board governors and senior staff after the journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two fed banks who subsequently resigned the new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades even in mutual funds be preapproved and prescheduled

the new fed rules for top people dont apply to Morgan Stanley (MS) wei because she isnt senior enough the trades were permissible then and are permissible now said the fed spokeswoman

Morgan Stanley (MS) wei referred questions to the fed the spokeswoman said Morgan Stanley (MS) wei had no responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services she said the fed did not assert any interest at the time in the federal reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the congress

ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem even if Morgan Stanley (MS) weis trades didnt violate conflicts rules

roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than  financial transactions apiece over the sixyear period analyzed by the journal some traded a single stock frequently while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks bonds and funds

in one instance the commodity futures trading commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the cftcs own rules

the financial disclosure of lihong mcphail an economist at the cftc showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the journals review her husband made more than  trades in an average of about  each trading day according to her disclosure form and the cftc

about onethird of those reported  tradesinvolved shorting stocks or betting on a fall in their price they ranged from amazon to ford motor co to zoom video communications Suncor Energy (Inc.)the cftc said all the short sales were made by her husband

over the years to safeguard the cftcs integrity congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees investing in amending the commodity exchange act congress also declared that any breach by a cftc employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a  fine and five years in prison the cftcs role doesnt include regulating stocks but in  the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families

nonetheless a cftc ethics official approved short selling by Morgan Stanley (MS) mcphails husband joseph mcphail a cftc spokesman said fearing that the commission could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no the spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commissions statutory authority

mr mcphail referred questions to the cftc the cftc spokesman said he didnt speak for the mcphails Morgan Stanley (MS) mcphail didnt respond to requests for comment

at the cftc employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the cftc to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest said the agency spokesman in this instance several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouses investments and received approval from career ethics counsel

mr mcphail was a senior policy analyst at the federal deposit insurance corp until september  in a written statement that agency said the fdic expects our employees as public servants to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nations banking system

the defense department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in chinese stocks even as the pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering china

across the federal government more than  officials owned or traded chinese company stocks including officials at the state department and white house the journal found their investments amounted to between  million and  million on average a year

reed werner while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast asia in december  reported a purchase of between  and  of stock in alibaba group holding Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD)

at the time discussions were under way at the pentagon over whether to add the chinese ecommerce giant to a list of companies in which americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the chinese government

defense and state officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist while the treasury feared this would have wide capitalmarkets ramifications mr werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist former defense officials said

nearly two weeks after the alibaba purchase the treasury updated its list and didnt include alibaba the companys stock rose  that day

three days later mr werners financialdisclosure form shows a sale of between  and  of alibaba stock

the sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist thentreasury secretary steven mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort

in an interview mr werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding alibaba to the list saying he attended a meeting in late  and was on an email chain about the matter he said that he wasnt involved in blacklist discussions during the period the alibaba trades were made and that the trades resulted in a  gain he declined to answer further questions

the pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didnt own stock in affected companies and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employees duties ethics officials certified that mr werner complied with the law

at least  other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded alibaba between  and  including jack wilmer who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the white house and then as the pentagons top cybersecurity official

between  and  mr wilmer reported at least Swiss Exchange (SIX) trades which he said totaled around  in the chinese companies alibaba searchengine giant baidu Suncor Energy (Inc.)and china petroleum  chemical corp

mr wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didnt direct any of those transactions he said he wasnt involved in policymaking decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didnt see a conflict between his job and investments he left the government in july  before mr trump signed the executive order barring americans from investing in certain chinese companies

within federal agencies ethics officials generally dont consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs ethics officials ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually dont know what employees are working on

when ethics officials do see a potential violation they can refer it to their agencies inspectors general who refer cases on to the justice department if they find evidence of wrongdoing

a journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts as more federal officials invest in the stock market ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing when findings have been referred to the justice department prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation

one matter at the securities and exchange commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouses financial holdings and trades for at least seven years the trades included stocks that sec employees and their families werent allowed to own some of which the sec inspector general determined posed a conflict with the officials work according to a report the inspector general provided to congress

when a us attorney declined to prosecute the secs inspector general reported the findings to sec management the unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up  hours of leave time

the sec declined to comment a justice department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said we take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them consistent with the principles of federal prosecution

are stock trading rules for federal officials ok or should they be further restricted join the conversation below

most federal agencies dont have protocols to verify that officials financial disclosures are complete one agriculture department official disclosed wheat corn and soybean futures and options trades the journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in  and  and omitted them from his reports

the official clare carlson who is no longer at the usda said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures and that the omissions were honest mistakes the agriculture department declined to comment

at the epa mr molinas financialdisclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials

the conflictofinterest rules say executivebranch employees may not participate personally and substantially in matters that have a direct and predictable effect on their investments and those of family members

when the ethics officials contacted mr molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms they were told he didnt have any influence over environmental policy

his duties are administrative in nature his boss the epas chief of staff at the time told the ethics officials he provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect on his financial interests the chief of staff said according to mr molinas financial disclosure

in his time at the epa mr molina clashed with ethics officials many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy according to epa emails reviewed by the journal at one point he didnt file accurate monthly trading disclosures for  months according to the epa emails mr molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports as required

ethics officials said they contacted mr molina scores of times to press him to file timely reports according to the emails reviewed by the journal

in one email a senior ethics official said his office had provided you with at least  times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee yet the required ethics reports were still late

mr molina told epa officials that he initially didnt know he was supposed to complete regular stocktrading reports he later struggled to keep up with the epas electronicdisclosure system according to the emails reviewed by the journal

in september  the epa fined mr molina  for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time mr molina refused to pay

we have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee wrote one ethics officer in an email to mr molina on oct   so i will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings

the next month mr molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him i feel that i am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else he wrote in a nov   email

if the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior mr molina wrote the epa should open an investigation i believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that i have done something wrong in this regard

ethics officials didnt investigate mr molinas trades or refer the matter to internal investigators

on the evening of jan   mr molinas final day working for the government epa ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of 

mr molina wrote out a personal check to us treasury and sent it to officials in the epas ethics office including to justina fugh an official with whom he had clashed",1816,buffet says invest in what you know,at this point what even is there to do  rules regulations exceptions waivers traders spouses senior officials inspector generals every agency we have all involved in one way or another we know they know they know we know rules exist to prevent and still goes on blatantly who watches the watchman,thanks for posting this original poster one of the better posts on this sub

current stock price,stocks,Profiting from a stock buyback where the current price is lower than the buyback price?,"i have stumbled across an investment fund that announced a share buyback at around  cent per share however the fund is currently trading at   cents a share they are yet to publish the full buyback documentation

my question is isnt this technically a  risk free investment assuming i am able to sell my shares in the buyback process

the number of shares they plan to absorb pretty big around  to  times the daily trading volume of the ticker in the local stock market 



i know the price range looks fishy the fund is safe and well known here

edit it s a tender offer",30,if its done through a tender offer you tun some risk that the offer will be over subscribed and not all your shares will get bought so not risk free but if you intend to hold it forever then it could be a fun thing to try,youre confusing this for an acquisition arbitrage opportunity,instead of looking at ratio of number of shares to be bought back and traded volume you should look at its ratio with overall floating shares if that number is not significant there would be negligible price impact of buyback

bullish signs

 founded by facebook cofounder left in  to start asana who just bought m in shares on  different buys at average of share in the last two weeks partner is exgoogle executive so they know their tech
  meaning last years customers spent  more this year to continue using the product  expand their use sign that current customers not only like the product but want to use it more
  were recently increased by  from m to m for fy

bearish signs

 without owners continued purchases the stock would lose a lot of momentum and return to a more normalized volumeprice
 m in revenues and m in  but now a b valuation doesnt add up cant be sustained
 has set a new alltime high almost every day for the last two weeks correction seems overdue
 above the upper bollinger band shown in image reference which is a big sign it is oversold and likely to return closer to the current mean  even if the company performs well in the long term went down significantly within  months the last time it went above the upper bb
 rsi above  meaning it is oversold and should return closer to the mean soon
 revenue increased by m last year but marketing expenses increased by m and total expenses increased by m basically every  spent on marketing only brought in  in revenue which is awful for any business it is especially bad for a product that doesnt have long term contracts and easy access to market for competitors however weve already determined current customers seem to like the product so maybe spending a lot of money to get new customers is good for long term growth
 july putcall volume is basically even shown in image reference stock went up huge in june on a  pc volume ratio but the next  days are  pc ratio in june x more people were betting it would go up vs down now it is even for july will be a lot more downwards pressure in the next  days if stock buyerssellers match that ratio
 accumulation vs distribution is literally off the charts x higher than a month ago this isnt the kind of stock that people will just hodl forever eventually these people that have had  gains in the last two weeks will sell for a profit and the spike will end
  with many of the bullish comments admitting they are probably going to take profits and rebuy soon rather unusual for a stock that has gone up so quickly so sentiment seems way down

trading strategy,stocks,"Swing trading strategy development, and general questions. Small account.","quick background info feel free to skip
i started trading early september and stopped about a week before the election because i thought that market was to volatile and i wasnt interested in losing money i was trading real money but only  i know  lots of people say i should have paper traded but i have consistent income and despite the risk i thought of it as if that  had bought me a new toy i was in it for fun not necessarily profit i ended up adding another  over the course of the weeks i traded i mostly traded by obsessively watching the news and being a bandwagon i made it up to  up  i also ended up losing all of my profit i dont remember why i should probably find out so i dont do it again anyways after i lost all my profit i was down to  again and with the election near i took my money out

a factor i entirely missed was technical analysis i wasnt interested to be frank and just wanted to play the news not only that but i didnt even know exactly what kind of trading i was doing day trading swing trading and so on i had zero strategy

im getting back into stocks theyre fascinating and exciting and a lot of the stuff that didnt make since before has settled and now makes much more sense but im still kind of stuck with a few things

id like to swing trade and here are some things iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) picked up and would like corrected confirmed as well as some follow up

i have seen several swing trading strategy videos where an rsi below  is a must why is this and how important is this when doing more research i see people analyzing charts and often times other criteria are met like macd but the rsi may be at  or higher which again raises the question how important is rsi

what are the most important swing trading indicators in your opinion from what i can gather its rsi macd  and moving day averages that being said i also see people who just make trend lines on consistent graphs zig zags that are higher peaks higher lows and these people pretty much just say buy in when the Post Properties, Inc. (PPS) meets the bottom trend line

what are the most useful patterns in your opinion i see cup and handle being mentioned the zig zag and big gap downs where you just wait for the stock to recover i know there are many more than these but im trying to simplify this for myself which is why i only ask to have  very good ones provided

is risk management pretty much as simple as understanding the ratio of how much you can lose vs how much you can make paired with stop loss orders anything more in depth on this is appreciated

i think i understand the general difference between large cap and small cap companies but i dont understand why youd trade one over another so far the only difference i see is that large cap appears more consistent which i assume is easier to play

what factors go into choosing your price range for stocks the most consistent i see for swing trading is  obviously thats dependent on capital though given ill start with around  where should i aim the main reason i ask is because the more expensive it is the less shares i own the more the stock has to run for me to make profit whereas i could buy the cheap stock and since i own more shares i need less percent increase to make the same profit 

sorry if these are bad questions or have been asked before iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried youtube but every video looks the same or they go over the same things three quarters of them dont even give you a real strategy or real information they just explain a mindset i wont lie i probably could have found this info somewhere but this is so much easier that being said and resources for those questions are greatly appreciated",3,"it is very difficult to make real money swing trading  there are lots and lots of strategies out there based on dozens of different technical indicators  i tried it for years with very mixed success  and i put a lot of work into it too  youll think you finally have a signal nailed down so you trade it only to have the stock behave differently than you expect  or it climbs  and you think youre off to the races only to see it drop right back down again

trading strategy,stocks,Trading strategy for when you’re up?,"i have a rough idea of a strategy for what to do when a stock i hold goes down  i can dollar cost average to lower my cost basis  this strategy works as long as i have money to throw at the stock and if i assume that the stock will go up again  thats a big assumption i know

what do you guys do when you hold a stock that has made gains and is up  when and how much do you sell

for a while i thought that i should hold for a year or more to pay the lower long term tax rate but that idea seems fairly poor when the market is extremely volatile 

a strategy i have considered is to sell all my shares and then rebuy at the same level to lock in gains  i think this would lock in any profits in the near term and could enable further dollar cost averaging if the shares go down again  if the shares continue to go up then at least i still have them

basic stock jargons  shortlong positions

long  youre buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value

short  youre borrowing shares from a lender brokerage investment firm individual investors selling it to someone and hoping to buy it back at a lower price your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price ill provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex

 person a is a share lender they want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation
 person b asks person a to lend him that share temporarily person b does not pay anything upfront but he promises to pay person a in the form of interest over time
 person b finds a buyer person c person c wants to buy a stock so it can go up person c is long on this stock person b however is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down
 person c pays person b  for the stock now person c has spent  and person b has gained  
 two hypothetical situation happens now
    scenario  stock value increases to  person c is now up  and he sells because hes making nice gains person b needs to buy back that share at  but he only gained  profit initially now he needs to fork up  to buy back the share and then return the share back to the lender  any interest accrued in this scenario the short lost money the long gained money and the lender made interest money 
    scenario  stock value decreases to  person c is now down  and he sells to cut losses person b needs to buy back that share at  but he already has  in profit initially now he pays  for the share leaving him still with  profit and returns the share back to the lender  any interested accrued in this scenario the short made money the long lost money and the lender made interest money 
 the above scenarios help to show why shorts typically hedge funds or experienced traders might want to manipulate the stock price to go down hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market which i will explain in a bit and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves shorts therefore have the opposite intention of longs they want share prices to go down and in the process can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat in other words when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt grow the business develop new products pay for expenses etc 

market manipulation

market manipulation is not new to the scene investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics and every day we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks specific categories or industries of stocks or the entire market market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator in this case these are the wealthy whales or hedge funds both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds keep in mind not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are shorts some are neutral and act as lenders to make money some are growthbased and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices and others are short which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch below i will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales

manipulation tactics on a spectrum

market manipulation can happen in certain stock sectors or the entire market there are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know but i will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it

scenario 

lets say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock x stock x is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value so they can hedge or protect themselves by selling put options when they sell puts they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration but on the contrary they will be collecting the premium or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put at the same time this hedge fund will slowly cover or buy shares of stock x so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money the manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover if they want to add another level of manipulation to this they can also purchase call options which will result in profit if the stock price goes up in this scenario hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy

scenario 

lets say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock x stock x is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock this hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position by buying shares selling put options or buying call options so they try a different route keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops take for example if apple and google began to hurl downwards this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss this in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly conveniently enough hedge funds own a lot of these big name fang stocks

 if i am a moderately sadistic hedge fund i can sell off a large holding of shares in the scale of multi millions or billions that are in the same sector as stock x which would incite fear across the sector creating panic sell offs the price will drop sharply across the board including stock x and the short position will produce big profits because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price they can now cover their short position essentially getting rid of it and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier only this time at a much cheaper price the hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again this can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades publicizing newly purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it etc 

scenario 

this one involves technology algorithm trading commonly referred to as algo trading this one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around algorithm trading is the process of using highspeed supercomputers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise in this case the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market which makes this  legal how this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made for you general investors we have mobile apps and webbased trading platforms to trade when we like a stock we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol the amount of shares the price we are willing to pay hit submit and confirm the trade for hedge funds using algorithm trading all this is done autonomously which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker when an order is submitted it goes through a brokerage fidelity webull etrade tda rh etc and the data is rerouted to a clearing house intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled but they take it on a first come first serve basis so if a stock is moving quickly hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster 

algorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios which is why they can almost guarantee profit algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability and it acts on various factors such as volatility volume interest activity news etc in some cases these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things ill start by talking about market orders vs limit orders before you make a trade on your brokerage you will notice an option that says market order or limit order market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time there is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time there may not be anyone selling at a good price and instead some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices for example some people set a sell limit at  for Gamestop Corporation (GME) if you did a market order and you get really unlucky you might end up snagging a share for  each when the actual share value might be  however when you set a limit order you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated 

in the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit remember when they buy or sell its processed significantly faster at the clearing houses so if youre that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves moral of the story do not purchase as market order  always purchase at limit order

trading strategy,stocks,Swing Trading Strategy Seems to be Working,"strategy is simple buy sqqq when fear and greed index is over  and sell when it reaches under  if its under  start to buy tqqq then sell when it goes over  again

the last dip under  was the th buy tqqq time to sell the st up over   
bought sqqq at  or after google earnings terrible report up  so far holding until under  again

is this a good strategy basically doing the opposite of the market shorting when others are greedy and buying when others are fearful the fg index seems to catch the days when market flips",5,"how far back did you backtest it there are a lot of false signals from what i can tell

for example you would have bought tqqq when the index dropped to  on april  only to watch the qqq make a lower low if you sell when the index hits  you would have sold for a small loss 

you would have shorted on july  when the index hit  only to watch the qqq rebound after a brief pullback and make a significant new high",i did this a couple years back  after about  months i made about the same amount as if i would of just left my funds in voo,good luck being contrarian is rarely a good strategy
trading strategy,stocks,Trading Strategy on Capital Gains/Losses,"i  same question over in tax and didnt get any actual input

has anyone taken this approach  if so what are the upsidesdownsides

i  have  in long term and short term capital gains this year and im looking at a pretty hefty tax bill  between state and federal taxes i estimate ill owe 

im under the impression the odds are in favor of me day trading   theoretically there is a  the markets will go up or down  if i buy k of spy for example and only hold it for the day  i  theoretically have a  chance of making money  however if it goes down  and i sell i realize a  loss  this would lower my capital gains to 

instead of me paying the govt  on   id pay  on    which means my  loss of  is essentially a loss of  or   and if it goes up same thing  i make  and have  left over after taxes

as long as i have capital gains is there any downside to this strategy",5,there is essentially never a benefit to intentionally losing money to offset capital gains you will always lose more money then you would have had to pay in taxes the only benefits could be if you had an opportunity cost to allocate capital elsewhere or if for some bizarre reason there was changing legislationtax brackets upcoming just pay your taxes,"man you robbed  min of my life thinking about this shitty theory making any sense

it does not losses are losses gains are gains only thing you can decide is you want to have more cash now tax harvest or later hold 

at best market tanks and you lose k if you harvest you have k more cash in your pocket today instead of some point later in your investment life but market did fuck you nice strategy","i was just thinking the same thing sort of sell a chunk of net losers wait  days and rebuy it would reduce my taxes from other income sources 

also depending on your tax bracket long term gains are lower tax  than short term the trick would be to realize your enough losses to cover realized gains while holding the unrealized gains long till next year to lower the tax bracket while also avoiding wash sale

you can deduct capital losses up to the amount of your capital gains plus   if married filing separately you may be able to use capital losses that exceed this limit in future years 

so in your case you could lose up to  this year  

this is known as taxloss harvesting by the way"
trading strategy,stocks,Do you hold cr*pto on Coinbase? Your assets could be seized to satisfy creditors in the event of COIN's bankruptcy.,"a filing late tuesday by coinbase included a new risk factor based on recent securities and exchange commission requirement for public companies that hold crpto assets for third partiesbecause custodially held crpto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate in the event of a bankruptcy the crpto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors coinbase wrote in the filing coinbase will take additional steps to ensure that it offers protection for its retail customers that match those offered to prime and custody consumers armstrong said in twitter thread late tuesday we should have updated our retail terms sooner and we didnt communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added armstrong wrote my deepest apologiesshares in the company  after regular trading as firstquarter revenue missed analyst estimates

see ceos twitter thread 

this disclosure makes sense in that these legal protections have not been tested in court for crpto assets specifically and it is possible however unlikely that a court would decide to consider customer assets as part of the company in bankruptcy proceedings

emphasis added

i made a  last week about coin asking for opinions because it was trading with a deep margin of safety based on dcf the stock is down another  in the last  days since my post following an earnings miss on the top and bottom lines

i listened to the earnings call yesterday and thought management had a good strategy and plan for execution however this news is making me think of the ceos response to a question from an investor about coins moat long story short coin doesnt really have a moat but the CNOOC Limited (CEO) claims consumer trust in coin is like a moat because it allows coin to sell people who come to their platform to buy or trade crpto new services like nfts staking defi etc they really made a big thing about how much their consumers trust them and how big a competitive advantage that is in a space like crpto where people coming into the market for the first time will generally get into the game through the most trusted name i think this news  that your assets held by coin including their custody business could be seized in the event of coins bankruptcy  should undermine customer trust in coin failing to disclose such a significant risk in a timely manner is a huge red flag for me as a potential investor and attorney

if theres enough interest from coin bagholders i can do a preliminary legal analysis of the bankruptcy issues to assess the ceos claim it is unlikely a court would allow the seizure of coinbases customers crpto the fact the claim is untested in court is enough for me not to trust the ceos conclusory opinion

i personally would not hold my crpto on coin until there is legal certainty the assets are safe in the case of bankruptcy consequently i have a negative outlook on coins custody business therefore i have a negative outlook on coins socalled moat and ability to upsell new customers into more products if people start using coin for bestprice execution only and begin moving their coins to another platform to hold and use their crpto then coins ceiling is a crpto trading platform not the allservice crpto platform management is selling to investors",2233,deleted,holy fuck i better cut my losses fron my  shiba investment,ps mods the autofilter removing posts mentioning crypto is annoying as hell when it comes to discussing coin
options market,wallstreetbets,Upcoming Week 2/19 Geee Em Eeee ITM Options Targets: Playing The Market Fuckery... Pt. 2...,"well as i predicted they kept the price over  so that the stack of  yes ten thousand options put contracts didnt get executed that tells me that they arent just tanking the price and that they are playing the options spread at the moment

it also tells me that they are scared shitless of shares needing to be delivered and taken off of the open market theyd rather keep the price boosted over  to stop delivery than to risk an extra  shares getting into long hands

but thankfully that also lets us know that theyre still playing the game if they were giving up and going into allornothing mode they wouldnt give a shit about the deliveries theyd either flood the market with  ftds while tanking the price to cover at  while hoping they have enough left over for the fines or theyd cash out what they have left now and file for bankruptcy while leaving the clearing houses to pay the bad debt

no theyre still planning on finding the cheapest way out of this without any or minimal legal trouble that means were still getting paid eventually

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been watching this for a while now and i think iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) gotten a hand on what they are doing this coming week will be the tellall and im going to explain why i believe the price can only go up

so lets crunch the  option chain and see where this train is headed  this week oooon gaaaaaame theeeeory queue intro music

current price 

put itm 

put otm 

call itm 

call otm 

at current price a total of  option contracts are itm

now lets look at possible price movement see they are keeping gee em eee at the line of demarcation between the singledollar price change contracts E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ET) al and the fivedollar price change per contract E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ET) al

that means that for every dollar that the stock drops it executes a new put option contract but it would need to climb five dollars to execute a new call option thats why i told you in the last thread that they are playing between the  range all week

see because of the contract price structuring it actually costs them more to knock the price down any lower allow me to explain

lets look at both the call and put sides of the option chain and for the nearest  swing in prices

there are  put options for  strike

there are  put options for  strike

there are  call options for  strike

there are  call options for  strike

now lemme explain why i believe this matters in predicting where the price is going to drift this week

if the price were to drop by  the net difference would be an additional  options that would be executed because of the contract price structuring  put options would become in the money

conversely if the price went up by  the net difference would be  extra contracts that would be able to be executed because of the price structuring only two new call option strikes would be able to be executed between 

if we were to just look at the next five put option contracts below the current strike price it equals up to  that means if the price were to drop  they would need to find delivery for an extra  shares

if the price were to go up by  they would only need to find  extra shares to cover the extra contracts that would be itm at 

let me say that again if the price goes down it takes more shares off the market because of the put options going in dollar increments while the call options go up in  increments

it is also interesting to note that ending the week at  would cause less deliveries than ending at 

my hypothesis they cant hold the price at  this upcoming week simply due to the lack of shares available and the buyer demand staying so consistent we only had milmil volume the last two days the shares are drying up

so if they cant hold the price steady they need to decide which direction to move it and based on the math moving the price up would save the shorts money by causing the lesser of two evils in extra deliveries

but one thing is for sure they cant let the price tank any lower this upcoming week it would trigger too many new deliveries

theres actually some serious game theory that says the best move to trigger the squeeze would be for us to allow the price to drop to exactly  at close of next week as odd as that seems

so whats my nonfinanciallyadvisingcrystalball predict that this weeks close will be on 



they are going to allow some big singleday swings tuesday and wednesday to send the stock price from  up to tickle the  mark so that they can go ballsdeep selling c premium and then they will hold the price just below the line

the next target after that would be  giggity as there is a large offset of calls vs puts at  that would cause the delivery equilibrium to start going net positive again i just dont think theyre going to let us get  in a single week as that would cause retail investor interest to start going up again

too long; didn't read we end next week at  and the slow bleeding continues until the week of feb 

ill be back when i finish another model im working on

 orgininally posted by u  thatguyonthereddits",4204,"nice job but here are the two things you are missing

 if there is a significant upward pressure these puts will back fire since they will have to buy back the shares that they shorted to hedge them they clearly orchestrated a massive reverse gamma squeeze to bring down the price but here is the thing about gamma squeezes they are not sustainable once these options expire the price will shoot back were it originally was

 a lot of put options expired last week less than what we have this week but still there were a lot of them mms have to buy back the shares that they shorted to hedge those puts this in itself can create the needed upward pressure i mentioned in  once the price starts going up especially if institutions also help the push youll see a the biggest inverse of a reverse gamma squeeze youve ever seen in history

here is also an important difference between a gamma squeeze and a reverse gamma squeeze when a gamma squeeze is over market makers are in control since they have a lot of shares they can now dump at whatever price they want but once a reverse gamma squeeze is over market makers are at mercy of whoever bought the shares theyve shorted and have to pay up any price shareholders decide

options market,wallstreetbets,Buyer Beware: The saga of my DGLY options “market” order.,"posting for a friend who is too new to post himself good rule by the way i am my boy from the setup his words below 

greetings to my fellow autists sharing this story to hopefully save at least one other soul from going through the last  hours of hell i just endured 

the setup me and my boy were looking to make a play on dgly thanks to some research on his part and some good E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) from some of yall here on wsb well when the market opened today we went to place our calls i put in a  limit orders at the current ask price about  at the time but no takers i put in a limit order at  above ask still nothing finally i say fuck it and throw in a market order figuring ill end up paying  or so order goes through all is well or is it i look at the transaction and i got the contracts for  each what the actual fuck 

i immediately shit myself and stare at my computer screen for about  minutes in shock my account immediately reflects the loss and im now down about  as reality slowly starts to set in and i wipe the tears away i decide to call my broker of course im on hold for about  minutes waiting for them to pick up but finally i get through i regale cliff with my dreadful tale and he gets to work talking with his office to see what he can do after about  more minutes i hear back apparently during the time i was trying to buy my calls there was a  minute window that no trades were going through i put in my market order and some how or another someone nabbed it up for the tasty  tendies he says that his guys in the back office are going to call down to the trading floor but not to hold my breath because hes never seen a trade get reversed in his life he says that this process may take a few hours but that he will get back to me asap then politely hangs up 

as i put my phone down i start to think about all the amazing trades i could have made with this  and slowly come to terms with the fact that  im never seeing this money again  my wife is going to absolutely murder me and  i am probably not going to work today as i am far to depressed to do anything other than play my ps and try to pretend im not living in this horrific nightmare 

after a few hours of gaming im just as sad as before and i decide i need to eat something even though im very nauseated and not at all hungry at this point its past noon my time and this ordeal has been going on for almost  hours suddenly my phone starts exploding and its my broker app i see random trades start going on my account for dgly calls  at a time first they are buys for  then buys for  im confused but also excited as any action is good action at this point about  minutes later i check my account balance and its back to normal my broker calls and tells me that somehow the market makers saved my ass and gave me the trades for  each instead of  he also informs me that in the  years hes worked there he and his coworkers have never seen a trade reversed like this and that its an actual miracle im literally speechless after cliff says hello a couple times and i come back to my senses i thank him for his hard work and offer to name my first born after him to which he laughs and politely says he was just doing his job we part ways and i stand in my kitchen staring out the window wondering if this all really happened or if it was just a terrible dream then of course i look at my account again and see the calls which are of course still red but hey i just got  back so im not complaining 

i fully expect to get absolutely obliterated by some of you all for not knowing this could happen but i genuinely didnt realize how bad you could get fucked by a market order as i said in the beginning if this saves even one person from what i just went through then all the downvotes will be worth it 

too long; didn't read i used a market order on a stonk that was mooning and bought it for x the ask price by some jpow money printing miracle my broker convinced the market makers to change the trade and i got  of my money back 

takeaways for everyone 

 if i were using robin hood i would most certainly be out all that money use a real broker and pay the commission fees for your trades you never know when it might save you 

 always do limit orders im sure someone out there will be happy to tell me why a market order could be better in some situations but you can go fuck yourself Cousins Properties Incorporated (CUZ) ill never do it again 

 buy dgly calls and help me get the rest of my money back 

i hope you all enjoyed my saga i look forward to reading the comments happy trading everyone",394,so you were the guy,"market makers have pretty wide latitude to fill market orders at reasonable prices this is why you should never put in a market order however in your buddys case this fill was at a plainly unreasonable price the market makers who filled it probably decided to reverse figuring the cost of a likely finrasec case against them would be higher than eating the trade

edit if you ever get destroyed by a bad market order talk to your broker first maybe you will get lucky like this guy then if that doesnt work call up the sec and finra they may be able to help dont bother though unless you paid more than double the securitys going rate

stocks,wallstreetbets,"About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.","sec data show  million of gamestop shares failed to deliver
bloomberg  on jan  the day after gamestop corp mania hit its crescendo on the back of a short squeeze for the record books about  million worth of shares were caught in limbo

more than  million shares were deemed failedtodeliver that day due either to buyers lacking cash to complete purchases or sellers not having the shares to settle trades according to us securities and exchange commission data

the sec report which covers trading from jan  through the end of the month is just one more indication of the dislocation in the market for the video game retailers shares

gamestop stock for months among the most heavily shorted on the new york stock exchange surged more than  from jan  through jan  as a legion of reddit users piled on forcing bearish traders to scramble for shares and brokers to take the highly unusual step of curbing trading

while the secs list highlights the extent of the short squeeze on reddits wallstreetbets forum where the gamestop trade was galvanized its evidence of something else the unproven theory that hedge funds were engaged in naked shortselling of the shares

short sales  when an investor borrows shares sells them and then tries to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference  are an everyday market occurrence naked short selling the illegal practice of selling shares that arent known to exist is just one possible cause of a failuretodeliver with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays

failstodeliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales reads a disclaimer on the sec website therefore failstodeliver are not necessarily the result of short selling and are not evidence of abusive short selling or naked short selling

failures to deliver can result in fines losses as well as reputational harm and in rare circumstances theres also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity

one thing is clear the grapevine texasbased company is an anomaly in the data ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldnt be delivered  a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of gamestops shares  it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top  during the period and it was only one of two companies the other being li auto Suncor Energy (Inc.)to feature atop a list dominated by exchangetraded funds

the data which is released twice a month tracks securities that had at least  shares that failedtodeliver on a daily basis the total number of shares for each day is a cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day plus new fails that occur that day less fails that settle that day according to the secs website

about  million gamestop shares failedtodeliver on jan  before falling to  on jan  the day after robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in socalled meme stocks",19046,"how long can they stay without delivering  does it reach a point where they are obligated to pay or just keep getting fined until they do

i know Gamestop Corporation (GME) amc and clov are not the same and i am not here to bash either Gamestop Corporation (GME) or amc just pointing out some similarities between the three i support Gamestop Corporation (GME) both amc and Gamestop Corporation (GME) full disclosure i am not the first to point out these similarities but i have looked into them myself using the charts i pulled off of the sec website al trades is where i first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and i just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided 

looking at the charts you see peaks in ftds in both Gamestop Corporation (GME) and amc before the price run up for Gamestop Corporation (GME) happened  times and the ftd pattern has an Erie Indemnity Company (ERIE) correlation the share price in my opinion 

the peak ftds for Gamestop Corporation (GME) were just over m and gmes float is m according to google

m ftds  m shares  just over  of the float 

the peak ftds for amc were just over m and the float according to google is m

m ftds  m shares  just over  of the float 

the peak ftds for clov were just over m and the float according to google is m

m ftds  m shares  just over 

another thing i want to point out is that amc before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from clov in june 

amc went from around  to  then back down to  

clov went from  to  and is now in the  range which it has been for a couple of weeks now is the bottom in for clov i dont really know but i hope so 

full disclosure i am a clov shareholder and very bullish on clov from all of my research i have done and that others have done 

i am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice just pointing out some things i see from the charts 

i hope that everybody does theyre own due diligence before investing and hope that everybody makes some money investing

trading,wallstreetbets,I am never trading options again,"this was the original title and post i wrote up before the events of thursday transpired everything in quotes was written by past me 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) disabled options trading i will dump all my money into blue chips and index funds iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) just made k over a span of  days 





the screen shots are incomplete because i was trying to sell quick its about k profit when you factor in i lost k entering the trade on shorter dated puts 

im going to be completely candid whether that gets me banned or not i will take that risk 

from the moment i uttered this comment i set fourth the most regarded scheme in history 



at the time frc hadnt halted trading i reached out to robinhood support to get their stance on what would happen during a halt i didnt show the full conversation but they were extremely unclear they said that i would be short if i exercised but id have a hard time covering that short position although this is not saying yes or no its definitely terrible communication on their part 

a lawsuit based on the hypothetical scenario we discussed is a complete long shot out of curiosity i asked a lawyer that day they said i was likely to win if robinhood backed out but they needed more details i did not trust this scummy lawyer i had another option  they have a history of bending to social media backlash theres even this disclaimer when stocks are halted 



i thought i could increase the odds by creating viral posts about robinhoods misdeeds hopefully robinhood would crack knowing their name was being smeared on the front page of reddit wsb backing me would have been helpful but not necessary i just needed to make noise 

i believed the chances i could cash out were high to begin with i was sortve right multiple brokers allowed exercising into a short just not robinhood they still may have made an exception as their support told me multiple times it might happen but i wasnt about to wait till expiration without a fight 

within the quest to fight robinhood i made this bet 



robinhood did not allow short selling for frc put holders as the terms of the bet demanded i sold the contracts instead of exercising based on the terms of the bet i do not have to pay anything i still planned on donating a few thousand until yesterday

whether this scheme would have worked i guess well never know frc began trading otc and exercising was not necessary anymore 

despite being correct iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) taken up a reckless unsustainable trading approach if i continue on this path i will lose everything iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen it so many times where someone makes a very intelligent correct trade then starts thinking theyre a trading genius they start making reckless bets in things they have no business buying this is an extremely slippery slope for me iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) blown up multiple accounts and i refuse to make the same mistake i hope i can set an example dont keep rolling the dice take the money and run 

i know its very obvious to everyone cashing out is the smart thing to do but in my position the rush of euphoria from a massive win like this is intoxicating the sobering despair of previous losses melts away its very hard to fight the imaginative ideas of becoming a multimillionaire and retiring under  i hope i can set an example and inspire others to break the gambling cycle hopefully i will be able to maintain self control but the urge to make one more bet is always there i refuse let myself squander this life altering amount of money

present moment

i saw pacw tanking after hours based on news that they were looking for sellers they had already said this in their er that they were looking to sell assets i felt the drop overblown fear from frcs collapse 

i bought when it was at  but because i didnt put a limit order in rh averaged purchase price was fucking  my god immediate k loss



 then i think to myself pacws drop is not completely overblown the need to shore up liquidity is bad in this environment and a recovery is higher risk so i thought let me buy a regional that is being pulled down just because everything is tanking First Tennessee National Corporation (FHN) 

the Toronto Dominion Bank (The) (TD) CNOOC Limited (CEO) firmly stated they were committed to buying First Tennessee National Corporation (FHN) so any massive drop has huge upside surely Toronto Dominion Bank (The) (TD) wouldnt back out of the deal  hours after i go all in 



i am completely spiraling into whirlpool of gambling and degeneracy i am trying to control myself i lost another k yesterday and made it back just as quick im playing with fire and im foolishly dead set on making back what iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) lost iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) finally found an amazing risk reward trade to make all my money back plus profit selling wal puts i still stand by the idea that this current panic in regionals is far overblown wal especially is nothing like frc and its odds of collapse are extraordinarily low currently selling  puts for a huge premium while that stock is at  this is a very safe bet to make back everything i will roll into the  puts for an even safe bet iv is at  this is almost free money wal is not like frc even if pacw falls wal will be ok 



then i can finally end this nightmare quit the gambling and move on with my life no more sleepless nights no more insane schemes i will finally come out on top and follow my original intentions after i made out on frc i am jumping into a wild ape cage posting this i am revealing myself to be a reckless fool to the millions that believe i owe an autism charity k the internet is brutal do with me what you will",2472,"im never trading options again

trading,wallstreetbets,I've been trading for almost 2 years now and lost everything 4 times.,"hi guys i decided to share my story with you because none of my friends in real life trade or invest their money so they dont understand how it is possible to lose it so fast i didnt lose big numbers because im from poland

run i

so my first what i like to call a run started  years ago when i was in high school i worked through the summer of  and made a couple of grand as a rational  yo i decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me for i am more ambitious that the rest of the society oh how wrong i was i started with trading what i thought were stock cfds with fixed x leverage as you could predict after  months of trading i lost everything and got depressed completely neglected school and made the worst decision of my life got into crypto

run ii

so in  i bought a gaming laptop with rtx and heard you can make some money by mining crypto at the time i thought crypto was i scam but hey who says no to free money right so after mining it i thought that it is such a waste for it to just sit in my wallet and started trading with it dont fucking do it i got rugged in crypto more time than i can count every single project that i got into was a scam tried some airdrop hunting but all i got from it was  usdt and  coin that i decided to hold and it went from  to  lost everything again

run iii

so we fast forward to  my th birthday so i get a lot of money from my family and friends and as a young and ambitious man i decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me again and put  of my life savings into a certain crypto ponzi called time wonderland and of course as a young and ambitious man i decided that mere spot holding is beneath and used leverage please dont do this after  days there was a massive liquidation of founder of the said ponzi and i got liquidated lost half of the money i got for my birthday in  just  fucking days after that i decided to quit crypto and went back to trading cfds longed the shit out of dax  days before russia attacked ukraine and lost the other half of the money

run iv the last one so far

so i live in poland and we border russia and after the war in ukraine started our government started a really good marketing campaign of the military forces so after finishing high school and being a broke degenerate i decided to join the army fast forward next month i get my first military salary and go back to trading after losing everything in crypto  times i decided that the lessons were learnt and its time to make it all back summer  ethereum goes up from  to  due to the merge narrative shorted the shit out of it at the beginning of september with x leverage and made like k more than the average yearly salary in my country thats actually the only time when i made a lot of money than shorted another coin dont even remember the name just dumb fucking luck and made another k all in the span of one week and after making what a the time for me was a life changing money i decided to you only live once it all trading altcoins with high leverage lost almost everything by the and of september  lost my last pennies in ftx crash trying to long their token i know its really fucking stupid i also longed luna during the crash im just really bad at trading

run v when 

so right now i study computer science and accumulate money to make it all turbo back trading i know i dont learn any lessons im a gambler i really love trading and want to do this for the rest of my life but feel like im addicted to it sometimes when i was about to get liquidated i would stare at the charts an literally pray even though im atheist not to get to

what do i do should i stop or keep grinding and just hope to get lucky

update i

the fifth run is going to happen sooner than later i think i will start with k and hopefully get to k if not than i will have some loses to flex

will cover it on my

 bear gang  a relic of the wall street where men were men and companies had to earn money adherence to bear philosophy comes with a natural selfrighteousness in the confidence that western civilization is an unsustainable debt bubble just a few more coronavirus deaths and youll be content you promise you lose money but youre morally right


 bull gang  your only regret is that you didnt buy more you sleep well at night because you are invested in the engine of the country you love your faith is rewarded when stocks only go up your wife may not love you for your intelligence but shell be content with taking half of the investment account in fifteen years


 kangaroo gang  thriving on market volatility adherence to the principles of the kang gang means that you attempt to execute multilegged options strategies no matter which direction the underlying stock moves youll still lose to the computers who do it better like a kangaroo youll bounce right out of this gang when you fully realize that profits are capped and youre too poor to give up gambling so young


 sloth gang  if you hadnt slept through market open you might have made a really good play today youre sitting mostly in cash because nothing is a sure thing often you hover over the limit buy button until the price of the underlying moves up and becomes too expensive or down that was probably the top even though you rarely ever make moves you still hang around every day 


 tortoise gang  you invested your pension in a broad index of stocks fifty years ago you never came close to paying the taxes that youve taken out in social security youve been receiving deliveries of physical gold bullion for years to better weather the downturn that wont come until after youre dead at least your offspring will provide liquidity in the options market for a time with their inheritance


 housefly gang  persistent annoying and attracted to whatever excrement the market dumps out you breed freely in the corpses of hertz ford and J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company (JCP) you are numerous but never alive for long


 vampire bat gang  known commonly as theta gang outside of the taxonomic hierarchy you gain from siphoning the profits of other gangs your toxic presence is a carrier for harmful options that infect bulls and bears alike you are perfectly content to bide your time in the shadows clinging to large outcroppings of capital you might eventually sell naked and get turned into soup


 opossum gang  primarily nocturnal you feed on futures and premarket movements from tokyo to frankfurt youll eventually end up run over and dead on the side of the road which is an excellent indicator for other gangs to trade on


 white rhino gang  still technically alive but teetering on the brink of extinction your account is down  alltime after getting blown up by a play on a chinese stock nobody remembers after the reddit upvotes fade youll still be there alone and with no hope for the future

underlying stock price,wallstreetbets,"Preparing for the possibility of a 1/29 squeeze - the importance of a solid sell wall, holding the line, and avoiding prisoners' dilemma cascading sell offs.","alright boys and girls weve made it to a pretty critical stage here tomorrow we face the possibility of a massive squeeze fueled by short coverage and the inevitable gamma squeeze that will come from thousands of call contracts being exercised some things to note  mms buy  of the underlying shares represented by call contracts to hedge each time theyre bought as weve seen in the past few days in this case mms are almost the same group as the shorts this throws a wrench in things that i dont know how to interpret anyone they worked together today to lock us out tank the price and make a  million dollar short sale while liquidating massive share quantities at a price so low it margin called anyone holding that many shares on margin in the first place we can expect buy lockouts and other bullshit but the gamma squeeze remains inevitable the gamma squeeze will not necessarily lead to or indicate the short squeeze happening no one knows it seems like the most important thing each investor has to prepare for on their own is an exit strategy for call contracts expiring tomorrow regardless of squeeze height and shares in the case of the actual squeeze happening if that investor wants to sell

as has been explained here a few times now shorts need our shares  period tomorrow they will buy shares and they will buy contracts to convert into shares they must meet the prices we set  again period hypothetically if every single person that is holding shares set the sell limit to k which rh now prevents as an aggressive limit then shorts would have no option but to pay that price if they want to cover or  and this is important  they can wait for holders to defect and sell early undercutting the sell wall the prisoners dilemma describes the problem of achieving maximal collective outcomes in situations where individual selfinterest comes into play in the event of a squeeze all holders will be faced with the question of when to sell even if a sell wall was established by  of holders at k if  of holders create sell orders at  the shorts will purchase all of those and then someone holding at k in the original  says fuck i dont want to miss out and lowers their price to  lets say  of that group holding at k does that now  of the holders are still at k but  of all shares have now been sold at or below  this would cascade and bring the price down

we are not a hedge fund or a hive mind and there is no way to ensure we all sell at the same time and i am not telling anybody when to sell this is all entirely hypothetical im not encouraging a specific price point  im merely describing a predicament we face  a market phenomenon perhaps right now if you look at the Gamestop Corporation (GME) order book the sell wall looks like a staircase moving upwards at a pretty natural slope that kind of sell wall will not produce the optimal collective outcome in terms of sale price in the case of a squeeze in that scenario the actual sale prices would likely never reach the top what would produce the optimal group outcome is a true sell wall where limit orders are flat until a massive kingdom of the fucking north wall at a single price thoughts i personally just love the fucking stock play with the bull you get the fucking horns

edit  this is the current sell staircase versus a sell wall none of this post is financial advice im just a retard drawing in my notes app

stock market crash,wallstreetbets,Imminent Stock Market Crash,"my thesis has several layers which provides a margin of safety 

 fed policy currently the fed is tapering and has said that if inflation persist they may increase the speed they taper if you look at history every single time the fed tapered the market corrects  the same can be said when they fed announces they are increasing qe the market reverses a downtrend and continues on a bull run this has proven to be  accurate in the us the market is forward looking and sees this coming in my opinion the market has already topped of course the fed could reverse there decision and decide to continue qe for longer if this occurs i will cover my short
 stocks under pressure arkk etf and the vast majority of speculative stocks are down  these are the first to be hit when we extend to the end of a bull run and the stock market participants are looking for a safe cash flowing companies to ride into the end that is essentially a flight to safety in anticipation of tapering and an increase in the funds rate
 fed announced taper on november rd the fed announced the taper since then weve seen stocks get smashed on any miss earnings and just the way the market is reacting to news has drastically changed most recent example is the new c variant any potential bad news the market is no longer just brushing off participants are confused and see the market as being irrational for no reason where in fact the real reason is because of the taper we will continue to see large draw downs on any negative news
 valuation the faang stocks is holding up this market as they are seen as the safest and best companies the world this has pushed there valuations to all time highs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is trading at a  pe and  ps not seen since the dot com bubble normal Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) or Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) trade at a pe of  and that was during the last decade where they had a massive run rate of growth ahead of them
 shift to small cap from large cap i have thought about the possibility of a shift away from large cap allowing them to correct while small cap coming back into favour keep the market propped up  however every single time Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has corrected or crashed the market does the same so unless this is the first time we ever see this happen it just isnt probable
 forward guidance aaple is only expected to grow at  in  and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) ish demand has been pulled forward and we are going to see a reset in their valuations based on forward looking guidance currently it is completely unsustainable and they have no way to grow into there valuations
 economic outlook inflation is rising which will put pressure on companies margins if they dont have pricing power on top of this i expect we see a much weaker consumer in  the cost of living is rising significantly in every aspect of peoples lives leaving them with less disposable income to spend on non essentials any correction in the stock market or housing market would further pressure consumer confidence making them think twice about going on that vacation or buying a new macbook etc
 china the chinese economy is on the brink of collapse the real estate giants such as evergrande are barely meeting payments on interest evergrande has  billion in debt and is selling assets to meet interest obligations real estate sales are down  in october the chinese see the inevitable real estate crash as these giant companies fail which will cause the economy to collapse and will have a ripple affect on the world china is the  purchaser of commodities from countries around the world as their economy slows they will purchase less which will put pressure on other countries gdp  we have already seen a massive slow down in china doing just this
 market is currently crashing the russel  peaked a couple weeks ago on november th and is already down  in nearly ever case small cap lead a crash not including black swan events and the sp follow behind within a matter of weeks also technical analysis on the faang stocks all show they were extremely over extended and have peaked which would be very consistent with the russell leading the crash and  weeks later now the faang beginning their crash   thank you for reading please poke holes in this thesis and invest at your own risk  dont fight the fed adapt to their policy

stock market crash,wallstreetbets,Imminent Market Crash DD. Why I believe the U.S. stock market and U.S. Dollar will fall.,"this journey began for me with a random conversation i was at a grocery store on my break from work and while i was looking at different greek yogurts i overheard a man say something i couldnt believe i turned around and said sir im sorry what did you just say he introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store locally owned in stpeteclearwater Venator Group, Inc. (FL) area the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around  for a crate of foodhe said one year later that same exact crate is now  this conversation was just  weeks ago 

sowhen i got into my car i had an idea i wonder what the us dollar index is trading atim sure its bloody red i assumed what i saw literally made my jaw drop im not jokingat that time the us dollar happened to be at a  month high i couldnt fucking believe it at that moment i knewwe had fucked up 

after already doing mini E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) on why the us dollar might fall just days before just watching random videos on youtube about dr burry and stock shit 

i immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation which was call options in tbt an etf with x inverse exposure on  us treasury bonds in simple terms this is a bet on hyperinflation i believe that the federal reserve will be forced to raise rates as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation faster than anyone is anticipating which in turn would collapse bond prices making the calls print i currently have a small position right now

the dollar index after j pows jackson hole speech  

now this brings me to the us stock market i sold all my stocks  days ago i have long exposure in only one position currently a  call debit spread in viac simply put if im wrong and the market just keeps going then the  i paid for spread will generate nearly  if viac is over  on expiration which is in  years

                  technical analysis

let me start with my ta firstwhich is alarming  

this was yesterday friday september 

here is one from thursday september 



spy is at a critical resistance leveli meanit literally is hitting the fucking roof here and with everything going on in the worldyou want more sorry to burst your bubblebut how was that even theoretically feasible its impossible in my opinion 

let me explain why

              updated gdp forecasts

am i literally the only one who saw on thursday that morgan stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter gdp expectations let me fill you in on a little secretthey cut their fucking estimates by more than half

for fuck sakes people this is huge this is a quote from a brand new article literally posted  minutes ago from the washington post 

the team at morgan stanley led by chief us economist ellen zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to  from 

gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the united states soyeah were fucked which in turn has an impact on some companies future earnings and we all know that wall street has extremely high expectations now 

             wall streets high expectations

so far  of s and p  companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of  according to data provider factset

the strong results put the s and p  on track to be the best quarter for beats since factset started tracking the data in   so what happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen you could have a slow correction based on this alone just on companies missing earningswhich i guarantee that will happen its going to be an earnings miss galore 

                     lumbergold ratio

simply put when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth

when gold goes down safe haven assest less risk that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive

so investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio

this ratio calculates how many contracts of lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold

get it good now feast your eyes on this   

i like this one better compared to the dow  


the lumbergold ratio has plummeted in the last  monthsliterally fucking straight down which is a key indicator for an upcoming correctioncrash rememberplay defense

side note lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation butgold was up big this week as welland say prayers for the people suffering from hurricane IDACORP, Inc. (IDA)

                consumer confidence

in simple terms increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money indicating higher consumption

sofor the month of july the conference board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about  households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability business conditions and overall economic situation

they reported  on the index for the month of july boywere they in for a surprise the month of august has a consensus estimate of  the number was a very surprising miss i wasnt surprised at all to be honest with you


                      conclusion

let me be cleari believe jerome powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus its going to collapse our financial system possiblyalso with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm also with rising delta concerns the new variant mu and mass evictions will soon begin

since the start of   the spy has hit  all time highs this is more than the epic run from  where spy hit  all time highs

no big deal right 


this is a chart of the total assets held in all federal reserve banks 

no big deal right
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

median american home prices have now surpassed the  housing bubble peak 

no big deal right 

i mean for fucks sakes i literally could go on and on but you get the point by nowlets not forget the craziness in the middle east right now massive devastating storms crippling our country rising food costs im sure gas will be very high soon also expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage you will see this trend dont get me started on the mass evictions as welland the fed has been buying mortgage backed securities the very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 

nowmy positions take this into consideration im  years old and i have about  combined in all of my different portfolios i may or may not have just got out of prison  months ago after completing a  year prison sentence sonot financial advice

 in cash

simply putcash is a position people seem to forget that and i will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies my choice of extremely cheap shares trust me i already have my shopping list ready 

good luck out there guys timing this is almost impossiblebut my timeline is within  months we will experience at least a  correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash its hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be and for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money

the company pltr has positioned themselves for what they call a black swan eventby purchasing  million in solid gold barsnot gold etfs solid gold barslet me remind you that they deal with information

im not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me im saying that maybe its time to scale back a bit on the margin move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big dont forget sleepy joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax possibly very soon from like  to as high as  if you make over milanother bearish catalyst for the market i literally could go on and on guysits pretty obvious at this point well at least to mebut what do i know i just got out of prison last december

options explained

the basics

buying an option gives you the right to buy call or sell put  shares of a stock at a specific price strike price on or before the expiration date european options are specifically on the expiration date  buying calls is bullish buying puts is bearish  to buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade premium explained more later

 if you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day you buy calls
 if you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day you buy puts

selling an option obligates you to buy put or sell call  shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option

 if you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price you sell calls
 if you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price you sell puts

the money

for calls

 at the money  a call with a strike price equal to the current stock price
 in the money  a call with a strike price below the current stock price can immediately be exercised
 out of the money  a call with a strike price above the current stock price  the stock must rise to or above the strike price to be exercised

for puts

 at the money  a put with a strike price equal to the current stock price
 in the money  a put with a strike price above the current stock price can immediately be exercised
 out of the money   a put with a strike price below the current strike price must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised

calls explained

buying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub and thus will be covered first  i will be using Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) as my example stock  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is currently trading at  and i believe that the sale of the new xbox around christmas time will increase the stock price to  by christmas  i would buy a call  i decide to look at the dec  options which you can see below



this is robinhood on a computer  at the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below

 strike price  the price the stock has to rise above to be exercised
 break even  the price the stock has to rise above to not lose money
 to break even  percent change in the stock required to break even
  change  daily change in option price in percent
 change  daily change in option price in dollars
 price  price of the option

in the above example

  strike price  in the money could be immediately exercised but the buyerexerciser would experience a loss
  strike price  out of the money could not be immediately exercised

the break even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk  this can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option  for the         the option can be exercised below the break even for a loss

buying calls

ok so the   strike is what we are going to buy that is  dollars per share for  shares so the buyer would pay a total of  for the trade depending on the bid  ask explained in the details below  we go ahead an buy that option for a debit of 

as the month goes on before  some things could happen

 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes up the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes down the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) trades sideways which will result in the value of the option decreasing explained in greeks

on  if you still hold the option there are a few possibilities

 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is above the breakeven well say  you can sell the option for a profit which would be almost entirely intrinsic value the contract would be worth around        this is per share so your profit would be  x       the  is the debit paid for the contract
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is above the strike but below the breakeven well say   the contract will be very close to break even and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below  if you are still bullish on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) this is the only time i would recommend exercising the option to buy the share and only if you have the capital to do so  if you are bearish or do not have the capital your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss  in this case it would be around   note robinhood risk management will automatically sell options if you do not have the capital to exercise them and it is close to the strike on the day of expiration
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is below the strike hold or sell to avoid max loss  your max loss in the trade is  dollars and the stock may run up towards the end of the day  if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) finishes the day below the strike the option will expire worthless

selling naked calls

if you are neutral to bearish on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) because you think the ps will outsell the xbox you could sell the  c  see below



notice to break even turns into chance of profit  this is a calculation using the greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade  you sell this call  this would mean you would be credited with  dollars initially  as the month goes on if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes up in value you will begin to lose money on the trade and if you desired to close the trade you would have to buy to close meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for  if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) trades sideways or decreases in value the options contract will decrease and you can buy to close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 

selling naked calls can be very risky  if you sell the call and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) shoots up the next day to  the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call  this means that you as the seller are obligated to sell them  shares of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) at   what happens if you dont have them you have to buy them at the current market price  so  x     you would then sell them for   your max loss on the trade will be        and that is only if the price goes to   if the price at expiration is  your max loss would be   for every  increase in underlying the max loss increases   to avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls to be discussed later

puts explained

buying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is still  and i believe the new xbox sucks  i think the stock will fall to  on or before   below are  puts



none of the metrics change except for what is in and out of the money

   in the money can immediately be exercised but the buyerexerciser would experience a loss
   out of the money cannot immediately be exercised

buying puts

the   strike is what we are going to buy so that is  for  shares so if purchased and filled this would cost us  dollars  note this is much more expensive than the  call this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price

as the month goes on before  some things could happen

 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes down the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes up the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) trades sideways which will result in the value of the option decreasing

on  if you still hold the option there are a few possibilities

 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is below the breakeven well say  you can sell the option for a profit which would be almost entirely intrinsic value worth around        again per share minus the debit would again get us around   notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration that is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is below the strike price but above the breakeven well say   the contract will very throughout the day and unless you have the capital to exercise robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not
 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is above the strike price you can sell to minimize profit or hold until it expires worthless

selling naked puts

if you are neutral to bullish on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) because you think the xbox will be meh you could sell the  p  this means you would be credited with   if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) decreases in value the option price will increase in value and you will lose money on the trade  you can hold to expiration or buy to close at any time for a loss  if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) trades sideways or increases in value the option will decrease in value and you can buy to close for a profit at any time

the same risk applies to selling naked puts as naked calls but is capped as a stock cannot go below zero

options pricing

the price of an option has two different parts intrinsic and extrinsic value

 intrinsic value  current price  strike price
    an out of the money option has no intrinsic value
    an in the money option has an intrinsic value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price
    example  Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) price   for the  c this option has an intrinsic value of  for each share or   but you can see in figure  it is  or  dollars to buy  that is where extrinsic value comes into play
 extrinsic value
    effected by theta and implied volatility
    can be calculated by extrinsic value  option price  intrinsic value
    theta
       the more time an option has to expiration the higher it is priced  this is because the underlying stock Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has more time to move
       the theta curve accelerates around the  day mark see the figure below  you can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value regardless of if it is in or out of the money it will depreciate



 implied volatility  a lot of math goes into this one but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time
    steady stocks like ko tend to have lower iv
    high growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher iv
    the iv of each option will be different depending on expiration date how far in or out of the money the stock is and the movement of the underlying
    iv crush  this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing  even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases decreasing the extrinsic value  be careful if you hold options over a stocks earnings

do i have to hold to expiration

lets say we buy the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)  c  do we have to wait until december  no  if the underlying increases to lets say  by next friday  we could sell the option for likely a pretty good profit  we payed  for the contract but the price of the call may increase to  so we could sell to close for a  profit allowing us to move on to another trade  but as we approach the strike delta increases and therefore may be worth holding  the break even information is only if you intend to hold the call to expiration and profit from exercising and then immediately selling the shares back into the market  due to time and market craziness i recommend taking profit from the option itself rather than exercising and using the shares

the details

going back to our out of the money  c on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) if you select the option you will open up the details surrounding that option  this can be seen below

xb



this explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is from left to right

 bid  highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price
 ask  lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price
 mark  often in between the bid and ask what you see on the main options tree
 previous close  the price of the most recent option sold
 high  highest price paid during the trading day for the option
 low  lowest price paid during the trading day for the option
 volume  number of contracts traded during the trading day
 open interest  number of total contracts not settled

bidask spread is the different between the bid and ask in this case   the closer the bid ask spread the more likely you are to get an order filled  slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock  if the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call by the time you enter the order the bidask spread might have moved up dramatically and your order might not get filled

open interest is important as well  if very low open interest selling or buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is

the lower the open interest and the wider the bidask spread is the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers  they will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bidask and will expect you to do it  if they are moving millions of options a day  is a lot to them and they will profit off of it

the greeks

you can see the greeks listed above for this call

 delta  how much an options price is expected to change for every  change in the underlying  calls have positive delta puts have negative delta  if Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) goes from  to  the price of the option will increase   puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases  delta will approach  as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike causing a natural increase in intrinsic value
 gamma  the change in delta for every  change in the underlying  gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike
 theta  change in the option price for every  day closer to expiration  theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date  if you hold onto the  c for a day it would decrease in value  per contract so a total of   you can see how this is an options buyers enemy
 vega  how the implied volatility affects the price of the option  a drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value  compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying  again be cautious of iv crush around earnings
 rho  sensitivity to interest rates has to do with the us treasury you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least

now the catch is that they all have hedge fund mommy and daddys that will be giving them sick stock tips so they win the candy jar at the end of the game now you take these stock tips from your students and fully leverage that on options with your measly teaching salary

market,wallstreetbets,The Greatest Market Bubble of All Time. A Full Bear Counter-Thesis.,"xb



the more things change the more they stay the same there is nothing new under the sun

xb

in every market bubble you always hear the same language the same rationalizations the same absurd arguments these people think they are offering some new unique insight in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history lets address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis

xb

 interest rates are low nowhere for money to go except stocks

when you really drill down into it this is some bizarre logic its essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable in other words its a manifestation of the greedy fear of missing out mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles

ultimately these bull arent even arguing that we arent in a bubble they are arguing we are in a bubble but that the bubble is justified

the obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a lowinterest rate environment whats the worst that can happen if i sit on a pure cash portfolio i lose  per year not good of course but not the end of the world either whats the worst that can happen if i dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes i lose  of my funds in as little as a month ouch

the idea that im forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing  a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset

of course the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply wont crash or that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious but the whole point is that the crash is never obvious especially to permabulls they see a dip and they buy it they see a deeper dip what a great opportunity so they buy more and before they realize the dip isnt simply a dip they are already fucked tale as old as time

the funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational why hold cash when bonds pay more why buy bonds when index funds pay more why buy index funds when spacs pay more why buy spacs when flipping cocaine pays more after all if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since it loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify

whats most interesting is that this argument isnt even new the ridiculously low interest rates set by the fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the  crash the fed is ultimately a bubble creator something even wsb is well aware of

 if you sit out this rally you will end up behind even if you are right

this is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls they argue that if you sat out the last  months something this is essentially a straw man argument except in reference to permabears then you would have missed out on massive gains and therefore the implicit argument is you can never sit out

if you carefully analyze this argument you will realize it is literally nothing more than fear of missing out to the extreme its fear of missing out disguised as macroeconomic theory i have to stay in the market perpetually i can never sit out because if i do i will miss out on gains and you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy

first of all i will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately permabears people who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains but not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are permabears there are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed

an intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear they adapt to the market and when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid permabear the bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out

xb

lets take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history

xb

major indicators of the great bubble

xb

 massive retail investment worldwide

what are some signs of bubbles historically well a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market do we have that today check on fucking steroids weve got people who cant change a fucking tire on their  civic downloading robinhood and gambling options on margin like what the fuck

the  iq mongoloid who was washing dishes at papa johns last tuesday do they even have dishes i dont fucking know is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking china or some shit are you kidding me do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching

not to mention the entire shortsqueeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in bangladesh is downloading robinhood to buy calls on fucking sndl or whatever the fuck

past us market bubbles were largely restricted to the us population it was mostly americans buying american stocks during the dotcom boom but wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into tesla at a  pe ratio whats that noise is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance

the max pain theory which is ironically popular among permabulls argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors this is of course bullshit but its food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo



 ridiculously speculative investments aka spacs

cciv is worth  billion dollars and it owns literally nothing no deal is in place no announced deal figures have been offered obviously the spac has no earnings or revenue to speak of just  billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium i can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed

what is a spac at the end of the day a rich guy steps up and says give me your money and ill decide what ill do with it in a few months

and a million retards step up and say sounds great take my money

tell me this spac shit isnt exactly like the dotcom boom when literally anything with a com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the hot new thing there is no way this spac mania lasts and lots of people will be hurt in the end



 options volume absolutely exploding

options are becoming the vehicle of choice for investors aka gamblers in the current market stock represents actual ownership of a company the foundation of the actual market but what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term i just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker

the question i sometimes ask is how much of this market growth is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume you know like derivative cdos leveraging worthless mortgages back in  its something to think about

ill just leave this chart here since it makes the case for me this is neither natural nor sustainable



 greater fool logic

ill just quote investopedia since im getting lazy here

the greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date this is because there will always be someone ie a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price

if acting in accordance with the greater fool theory an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality if the theory holds the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another greater fool who could also be hoping to flip them quickly unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices

the greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions in  when investors purchased faulty mortgagebacked securities it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed

basically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value this is talking about you



 buffet indicator through the roof

the buffet indicator has reach its highest ever level for noobies who dont know what this means the buffett indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by us gdp a very high buffett indicator suggests an overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom

there are two arguments against the buffett indicator as a useful metric the first argument is that gdp is a backward indicator and therefore doesnt account for future growth while this is true it misses the entire point the point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles the point is to tie market valuations to some realworld metric which is necessarily backward looking

the other argument against the buffett indicator which holds more weight is that us stocks consist of global companies and therefore arent adequately represented by us gdp

i will say these people have a good point but they are also missing several nuances within gdp and market valuations which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post suffice it to say the buffett indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation and cant simply be discarded



 valuations divorced from reality

during every major bubble people like to come up with new fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company back in the dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of eyes that is the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website

this internet thing was a new paradigm and so obviously we needed new metrics to determine how valuable these companies were needless to say the vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight

take your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation i like to pick on tesla personally because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun



 fed manipulation

most bubbles have been created by federal reserve control of currency and interest rates this market is no different they create a bubble and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new bigger bubble until that pops and so on its like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house

the catch is interest rates cant drop below zero i mean they can but who wants to be japan for the rest of history

alright iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) written enough already and i wont write a whole thesis on fed action and its consequences for now global markets ill just leave this pic here

share price,wallstreetbets,"Sir Isaac Newton secretly wrote about GME, and was a 💎🙌 💪🦍 who gave us a target share price","isaac newton is known as being one of the biggest smart smarts in history 

but did you know he secretly wrote about the Gamestop Corporation (GME) rocket ship in his work philosophi naturalis principia mathematica  years before gamestop was founded

xb

that means he was even smarter than we thought and heres the proof

xb

       

newton stated that there was a universal law of gravity and many interpreted his writings as a way to calculate the force of gravity on earth

looking at his equations they assumed he was speaking of things like mass radii and acceleration 

g  General Maritime Corporation (GMR)

xb

they took this to mean that the gravitational constant of earth was  Morgan Stanley (MS) and thought that they were the equally smart smarts for understanding newtons work

g     nmkg kgm  
  
g   Morgan Stanley (MS)

xb

however while this interpretation was heralded as a breakthrough in physics it was wrong and they were actually    who misunderstood what newton was saying

to understand what he really meant by the equation 

g  General Maritime Corporation (GMR)

xb

we have to do a bit of rearranging because he didnt want his secret code to be found out too easily

General Motors Corporation (GM) g  r

xb

next we have to change the little s and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) (GS) to big es and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) (GS) since newton wasnt a small minded hedgie

Gamestop Corporation (GME)  ge  re

xb

see what that says    

xb

newtons target price for Gamestop Corporation (GME) was the price of ge multiplied by the squared price of everest re group Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD) ticker re

that gives us a target price for Gamestop Corporation (GME) of

 coin collects revenue on trading usd volume not asset prices more trading buying and selling  more revenue
 each cycle has introduced a new volume range
 paypals and squares and affirms valuation indicate the markets are willing to price fintech at large multiples

we can readily compare coin against paypal and square they all offer peertopeer payment solutions are involved in the currency space and offer exchange services while pypl and sq both offer more established merchant solutions thats not to discredit coins efforts in enabling businesses to accept currency via its commerce service which could become popular as opinions and usage continue to increase favorably

coins 

  billion revenue
  million profit
  million users

using these numbers we can approximate the annual numbers

  billion annual revenue
  billion annual profit

this is making  quite large assumptions

 quarterly revenue is not seasonal  revenues from q q q q are approximately equivalent
 revenue is sustained  revenue is not dependent on asset prices but rather trading volume more on this later

 comparison

 coin numbers assuming share

 while a  ps ratio may seem rich this would be within reason of affirms 

  assuming that revenue streams are sustainable and continue to grow theres no reason why coin cant trade at b when compared to paypal and square multiples

 

 argument for sustained revenue

 coin collects fees on buying and selling if the assets were to suddenly correct coin will still collect fees on the sell side we can make a strong claim that coins revenues are primarily dependent on volume not asset prices



 despite huge volatile corrections trading volume has entered new ranges with each cycle
 this observation also applies to other assets

stock,wallstreetbets,Robinhood Stock Lending Experience,"too long; didn't read how much can you make about  not    annually almost nothing

im sharing my experience with robinhood stock lending because it was very hard to find information online about how much you can make

robinhood states  stocks with low market availability and high demand are more likely to be borrowed

i owned about  shares of a low volume stock that had a short squeeze in the month of february it went up about  and had x more than the average volume on many of those days thus i think the month of february encapsulates what would probably be the best month to loan out my stock

throughout february i owned about k to k with all shares loaned out for every day of february

from february i earned a whopping  and  cents just to be clear thats approx conservatively a  annual rate

so this is nothing at least with the amount of stock i own and the question becomes is it worth it for my stock to be loaned out to short sellers who are going to manipulate the stock i believe in and also apply downward price pressure for me thats not worth it and i turned off stock lending

according to robinhood they determine how much you make by a rebate rate that is  of the weighted average rebate rate we earned by lending that stock to borrowers on that day per my understanding this means they loaned it out with about  interest which makes sense

but  robinhood thats way too low its our moneyproperty after all want us to take the risk that you default which check notes  and let stockvote manipulators bet against our own companies  is too lowrobinhood stock lending experience",138,"user report

stock,wallstreetbets,Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble!,"lately there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever

why the stock market is in a bubble  investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dotcom bubble  

even professional investors whom i consider levelheaded and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable

this will not last  

adding to all of this we can see that the shiller pe ratio is now climbing close to the  dotcom bubble level



while its easy to say that its all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend i feel that we might be missing the other side of the story the s are wildly different times compared to the s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens there is an immense difference in the available capital interest rates and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to  years back 

so what i wanted to analyze is should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the new normal given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in finally this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments 

the warning signs

lets first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market spoiler alert  there are a lot of them

pe shiller pe cape

the price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the marketcompany is overvalued when compared to historical trends shiller pe is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal pe

the current concern is that as of nov the shiller pe for the sp  crossed  which is the highest reading in the last two decades the last time the shiller pe crossed  was during the  dot com bubble the value reached only a max of  before the  financial crisis

the red flag here is that those who invested when the cape was above  last time  had to wait another  years to break even for a brief period of time just before the  housing market crash and then wait another  more years before the market consistently settled above their buyin price

money supply growth aka money printer go brrr

th of all us currency in circulation was printed in  while it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat one can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation



increasing use of leverage

there are two ways of using leverage while investing the first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past  years

 for almost  investors shows staggering results  of gen z and  of millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market more than  of the surveyed population borrowed more than k or more for investing while leverage works great in a bull market it can destroy your portfolio during downturns 



the below research by goldman sachs shows an even more concerning trend retail brokers alone are now trading more options than the entire market used to do in  while this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as robinhood fidelity etrade etc its highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it



rise of new issues and speculative assets

more than  billion have been raised by ipos this year this is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the  record in the dust the cherry on top was  where the company is now valued at more than  billion with zero revenue and less than  million in preorder deposits

spacs 



this is without even getting into the speculative world of crypt where  for more than half a billion dollars a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of  billion and there are now more ICOS Corporation (ICOS) than anyone can keep track of

investor expectations

more than the pe ratio investor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history the pricetosales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the companys sales as we can see on the chart below more than double the companies are trading above x their sales when compared to the  dot com bubble



if you consider a  stocks that had a very high ps ratio have underperformed those having low ps ratio since most companies dont grow as per expectations



now thats a lot of bad news for anyone to digest but

are we certain its a bubble

there are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally just because we are in an impressive rally it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash lets look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years

lowinterest rates

this is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the s dotcom bubble between  and  the fed rate varied from    compared to the historically low  that we have now this means that the capital available now is much cheaper to prop up the economy after covid than it ever was this is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns



new investors

its no secret that we all hate robinhood but the data they put out during their ipo filing shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investorstraders coming to the market all of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now



k and index funds

as i have highlighted in s the amount of inflow us index funds receive is massive more than  billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the vanguard  index fund this year and index funds are expected to make up  according to  from fidelity the average k account now has a balance of k and  of workers increased their contribution

the key point being all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market 

whats the implication

as long as the above factors remain as is fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital we might see the party go on much longer than expected

conclusion

the market of  is significantly different when compared to the s as we can see there are more investors cheaper capital and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before so i feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dotcom bubble is a tad wrong

but thats not to say that all is well almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future

the expected annual return by investors above inflation is a whopping  which is  more than what is realistic  this is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly doubledigit return is the norm



even if we are in a dotcom bubblelike scenario  perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble

basically even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in  investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to tulip mania as early as  making money using that information was hard there were a few investors such as mark cuban and john templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected

it makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market but pundits have been calling a  right now based on fundamentals the chances do look far higher it does make sense to not make significant onetime investments in the market now but changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best longterm strategy

as peter lynch quoted

far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves

until next week

footnotes and existing research

 the amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zerocommission trading model was staggering in the s average commission per trade was 

 as always i am not a financial advisor this is not investment advice please do your own research before investing

 leverage only makes sense as long as the equity you are investing into would give better returns than the cost of capital at which you borrowed otherwise your losses are magnified as you have to pay the interest for the borrowed money as well as take your losses on the underlying asset

 is a company that has no commercial operations and is formed strictly to raise capital through an initial public offering ipo for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company its generally considered riskier to invest in a spac as it has lower reportingregulatory requirements when compared to traditional ipos",807,way more people have access to the stock market nowadays and tech isnt only a speculative asset but has become a huge part of all our lives,"the crash didnt happen all at once
petscom was shot first basically the rivian of the time
then other nternet stocks like jeeves etc
finally it came for serious businesses like cisco

whats the relationship to today

highest speculation will die first krypto or Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) is my guess

then other high flyers 

then serious businesses that are overpriced will get a haircut

so im watching for a speculative market to crash before i start thinking about sitting on the sidelines","correct the pe to interest rates graph shows a different picture liquidity is chasing returns bidding up prices very different to dot con which was euphoric expectations ignoring returns of a cash ratetreasury and the other sectors

everything is overpriced is a common statement well you are competing against leveraged institutional buyers backed by fed interest rate suppression yes returns will be low valuations will be high"

trading strategy,wallstreetbets,GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,"i made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on Gamestop Corporation (GME) and several people asked that i turn that comment into a post so here it is

obviously im going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze

first the comment as it was

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen lots of bullish ta on Gamestop Corporation (GME) keep in mind all ta requires volume to play out how it should we havent had any volume on Gamestop Corporation (GME) in over a week

holding shares simply isnt enough  needs constant all day every single day buying of shares and in the money options

if you buy options that are  in the money they literally cant price pin because they cant get and keep the price  below current market so you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge and virtually eliminate their means of counterattack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain price at which most contracts expire worthless

if you are intending to help push the squeeze buy shares throughout the day every day if you are playing options mostly buy calls in the money if youre buying otm calls buy as close to current price as you can afford the more imbalanced otm calls are the more theyre just going to price pin at maximum pain they literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new itm call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge

essentially we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with gamestop there are two major reasons 

 manipulation we cannot do anything about this really aside from buy and hold technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels the shorts while stuck in a stupid position arent stupid they know when the ta is indicating a bullish setup and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup

 volume all technical setups require volume to play out if volume doesnt follow the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable except in this case it goes down because its being shorted at every chance

so what do we need to do hold yes but that cant be it if we are doing nothing but holding this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient they can literally hold us in a stalemate for monthsyears if volume never shows up to move the price yes they pay more interest the longer they have to wait theyll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the sec steps in to stop market manipulation 

volume

without volume there is no endgame look at every day weve had spikes look at the volume now look at the past week or two we arent making progress because nobody is buying shares aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks believe it or not the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze the whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time if it catches on they can follow it up but if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail

this thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days if you look at any day there are surges in buy volume but theyre short thats likely a whale testing the market if they see confirmationfollowup from the market its less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure so it will be something like whale buy retail confirmation buys whale buy runaway effect gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze all of those things have to happen consecutively fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack

now this is going to sound counterintuitive but in order to catalyze the squeeze we have to stop just buying the dip when volume picks up and the price is spiking thats the most important time to buy thats the point when additional buying pressure is most important and until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes we are going to keep bouncing back and forth

options

the other side of the coin is options purchases stop devoting the majority of your capital to far otm lotto tickets this helps the short positions because it forces the market makers to help the shorts market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk when you buy an c it does two things

 they dont have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral

 in incentivizes the market makers to pin the price

you can do some additional reading on max pain price in options but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless when you buy otm call options youre increasing the maximum pain price which makes it easier for market makers and shorts to pin the price there

if however youre buying a ton of itm call options youre doing two things

 deep itm calls have a delta of essentially  this means that in order to remain risk neutral the market makers essentially has to buy  shares immediately upon selling you the contract

 it lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) this means in order to pin the price at max pain they would need to drop it from its current price

not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately meaning they dont care where the price goes you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price

if you must buy otm calls buy ones that are at least closer to being itm the further otm you buy calls the more likely the price will go sideways you can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases once it achieves a runaway squeeze which will be easy to identify you can start buying your lotto tickets

too long; didn't read in my opinion if you want to help catalyze the squeeze you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least  in the money",2759,buy high never sell got it,makes total sense,i seem to only buy high so this works out for me i try to pick up one extra each day

trading strategy,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with this trading strategy?,"i gotta be honest with you im kinda mentally handicapped   
but i dont understand how my strategy couldnt work iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been using bollinger bands  
since they do a great job of keeping the chart within the boundaries almost at all times  
so isnt it a good idea to just always sell an asset short while its at the top say above sd  
then secure gains at around the midline wait for it to go to an extreme value again and take a long or short position accordingly once again  
i identified two risks first is the price moving in a slow trend with low volatility when there might not be any opportunity to sell or when the price makes a strong fast movement the first risk can be mitigated by simply selling after some set time and when the price remains roughly in the middle for a long time and the second situation can be identified with moving averages this strategy has a downside of not taking advantage of long and big price movements but should be absolutely killing it in ambiguous market conditions when the price is moving horizontally or at least thats what i figured most stable stocks should have a lot of those boring periods when the strategy works even if the market was changing periodically it should still generate positive outcomes with well planned stop losses how could this not generate worthwhile returns",6,"user report

too long; didn't read i think bollinger bands could be used to generate consistent returns in sideways markets but i may be wrong",ta tells you what has happened   it has zero predictive power   trends that you think are ending will continue beyond what you would expect and price action will reverse at the most unexpected times   bollinger bands are not the path to unlimited effortless money,it is impossible to predict the future movements of markets with  accuracy so there will always be some risk involved in any strategy however your strategy sounds like it could work well in many situations and may produce good returns overall one thing to keep in mind is that bollinger bands are based on historical data so they may not be as accurate in predicting future price movements also moving averages can lag behind the current price so you might miss out on some potential profits if the market starts moving up or down quickly overall though this seems like a solid strategy that could work well in many cases

 ways it affects it first through risk reversal it calculates the difference between iv of otm calls and puts usually  delta if positive there is a long bias on the underlying pair if negative short bias

second way it affects them are through pink risk when you have massive positions expiring in the coming days and the underlyings spot price is close to the options strike price the strike price will serve as a magnet for the spot price of some sorts as the option buyer will adjust hedge according to changes in the underlying delta that is if call on eurusd goes otm euro depreciates the delta will approach  he will therefore sell his current positions in usd as to readjust his hedge this is increasingly important when expiry date approaches as delta approaches extremes",nan,nan

would it be wiser to buy ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) with my existing usd or euro
i think the euro price of the stock will go down when the usd devalues because eur will get more valuable and i would get less company for the same amount of euros or am i mistaken

stock price,Forex,Bid/Ask Confusion on Candlestick charts.,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) come across a problem in trying to understand bidask concepts in trading

from my understanding candlestick charts show the bid price im trying to understand if the chart is showing the current available highest bid price highest buy limit order or the last traded bid price

for exampleill use stocks as an example to make it simple imagine there are

 bids for stock x at 

and 

 asks for stock x at 

none of the buyers or sellers are willing to budge all of a sudden  of the buyers gives up and puts in a market order to buy at the ask of  now we remain with only  bid at  and  ask at  and no one budges anymore so no transactions are made anymore

would the candlestick chart remain at  since thats the current available highest bid price or would it have gone up to  and stayed there since that was the last traded price where the bid was 

consequently would the bidask quote remain the same as before ie 

thank you",1,"the bid price would stay at  because that one buyer was absorbed into the bid price so theres still one person buying at  and one person selling at  so the price hasnt changed what has changed is there is now half the liquidity in the market

good question by the way got me thinking",deleted,is forex comparable to stocks in that way arent we transacting with a bank not with other holders of the currency in other words the ask is always what the bank is asking and the bid is always what the bank is willing to pay
stock price,Forex,Liquidity and Volatility - Thoughts,traders can benefit from the volatility and liquidity of the stock market trade the pool by engaging in day trading a single trading session might see a stocks price swing significantly offering chances for fast gains because it has the ability to provide significant profits in a short period of time this is advantageous for both new and seasoned traders,4,yes trading in the pool can typically produce higher degrees of volatility than other trading strategies it results in a profit,i only trade during the new york session since there is so much volatility and it is so simple to trade the pool,due to the high volatility and ease of trad the pool only trade during the new york session

strategy,Forex,Will sharing a strategy reduce its edge?,i wonder if the reason people are so reluctant to share their profitable strategy is because they dont have one or because it will lose its edge if too many people find out,5,"the amount of effort you put in its hard to get into depth so i dont bother i just tell people to use babypips watch some youtube then come see me in  years

 trader a uses it like a bot systematically
 trader b uses it while considering swing structure
 trader c uses it with swing structure retests and sr levels

a will not survive every market condition b will know when to stop trading but have considerable drawdown c will have the least drawdown of the three

trader c proved that the pullback strategy is profitable but the other two made it look like a failure its the wielder not the sword

so it doesnt matter if everyone knows about this strategy  because they dont have the main ingredient of experience in the form of hours","dont think so i just dont want my friends to copy my trades so they could earn more than me n if they steal it n decides to sell a course one day based on my holy grail

strategy,Forex,How much time/experience did it take you to have a winning strategy?,i have started studying forex for a month and a half and even though the  statistic scares me i continue using market simulators for trades and stockpile pdfs to read but taking all of this into account will it be enough or is there a threshold i must cross to join the  does it take time and expertise or a sharp mind i myself have autism i find that im not too intelligent or clever when it comes to understanding market movements i have  books to read by now so i wont be hitting that threshold soon but i want to know if i will be able or not to succeed in this,54,"it took me  years of studyingpracticing  hours a day to get to a stage where i wasnt having any losing months the  statistic is scary but what makes it even scarier is that it doesnt mean that  of forex traders are doing it for a living it means that a big chunk of that  has just been lucky enough to have their account balance sitting in the positive during whatever snapshot of time that data was gathered the real failure rate is closer to 

no you dont need to be rain man or have a  iq but keep in mind if you are going to continue with this you will need to be obsessed trading will likely consume your entire life right now you seem to be doing the right thing information gathering and theorycrafting is step one and reading all sorts of pdfs is a good way to gain exposure to how various people view the markets dont take anything you read or hear as gospel or as a holy grail but just keep it in mind and if it makes logical sense to you backtest it heavily

the next step is taking a combination of what you learned attempt to break it down into definable variables and backtest the living hell out of every factor you want to use in your trading framework this can take months or even years and can be soulcrushing but it is necessary if you dont give up during this stage and you have crafted a trading strategy that works well throughout your historical data and has proven to also work in the live markets then continue to execute that plan while managing risk and reducing your exposure across correlated markets and your account will steadily grow good luck","anything below  months is speculation and luck after  months you will be able to start making money but not sure if you will be able to pay all your bills from it after  year you can potential start paying bills from this 

why is  year minimum because you need to go at least once through all market conditions certain elements will influence the market in may but most like they will not be the same elements that influence it in december 

you need to spend a lot of time before you truly become profitable remember that on the other side of the trade there might be a professional that has gone to university and spend maybe  years to learn the same thing you are trying to do in order for you to make a profit someone else needs too loose their profit so this is just a very big chess game if you are not good at calculating your next  moves you will never pay your bills from the forex or stock market 

you should spend  of your time reading everything you can find and the other  trading use in the beginning a paper account after  year spend  reading and  trading 

why read what others are writing not because they will give you the winning strategy as most likely you will learn their mistakes instead but because there are certain lessons to be learn from other peoples mistakes as well it is like your parents telling you when you were young dont go in the deep end at the pool as you might drown you never tested if this is true or not you just understood it is a mistake and never made it 

one mistake that i did and am recommending you avoid it is never use an indicator if you dont know what it does do not use macd and rsi just because you read about them in all of the books and blogs go on investopedia and read what they are what their formula is and understand why it is not perfect 

next step would be if possible to learn some scripting such as python or pinescript and make your own data analysis and your own indicators by modifying some existing ones and improving them at least for me this is what has made me truly profitable 

and remember in forex that the best indicator is your calendar no matter what your strategy is if a PMI Group, Inc. (The) (PMI) or ppi or unemployment number comes out they have the power to change the market trend in  minutes so find a data provider that shows you when different numbers come out and always have an eye on them as information data is kingqueen 

hope this helps somehow","it took me a year of programming to develop my own indicators and put them together to build a system it took me a few weeks to solidify my risk management 

its taken me  years and still counting to get my head out of my ass and focus on being a quality trader looking back iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found that the most difficult thing to grasp was trading psychology systems are easy you build it test it modify it test it again and continue 
your own mind though that is the difficult part especially since your conscious stress becomes subconscious self loathing and then in turn the subconscious self loathing becomes an avenue for you to sabotage yourself without even knowing eventually you are pulling your hair out because you cannot understand why you are not producing the same results as what your backtesting did 

my advice to you is to build a system that allows you to trade infrequently during quiet times in the market 
a system that trades frequently will get caught by a lot of the noise the market produces when the big traders enterexit their positions 
understand what support and resistance is not the conventional lines but the actual supply and demand zones these are areas where big money either sees the asset undervalued enough to buy or overvalued enough to sell 
once you have that in place you can then add indicators or whatever on your charts to help give you a clear picture of the reactions to these zones of interest 

please do not listen to these knuckle daggers when they say that price action is better than indicators or that scalping is better than swing trading the fact of the matter is that your brain will process information the way only your brain can and it is your job to find a technique that aligns itself with the processing capabilities of your brain there is no such thing as the best strategy or the best system or the best technique these trading styles only seem best to the individual simply because that style fits in with how their brain processes information some people need pretty pictures and shapes while others rely on raw data and statistical probabilities while others dont need anything and can gather information from pure price action alone the market has a niche for every thought process find one that resonates with you and practice that

trading,Forex,The realities of Forex Trading. You won't get 'rich'.,"forex trading is a job its not a path to wealth or riches you gotta wake up every day and sit there watching the markets and if you dont watch it right you dont get paid


if you watch it perfectly you might make  per month realistically

as comparison if you study hard and get a nice programming job in tech that might pay kusd per month work from home after  years you get paid k as long as the code works and almost anyone can learn this if they try
you will always get paid the k you can take sick days you can take holidays you can finish the job on  days and spend the next  days playing video games and still get paid


if you forex trade and want to make k consistently per month you need k in cash you then need to take your k and deposit it in some shady broker website where you could randomly never see the money again

then you need to deal with your broker taking commissions of every trade and possibly stop hunting you for your k

if youve never had k to your name really ask yourself if you had this money would you really put it at risk day trading forex


after all of this if youve worked hard and not taken any days off you can make kusd per month


then you gotta pay your taxes yourself and your health insurance and bills


this is a game thats designed to be played when you sold a small business for low  figures and you can throw a few k to a reputable broker and make a wage on the side while you work on your next business

its not something you can take k and turn it into earning k per month not in  decades can you do this and the worse part is every single day you sink into this is a day you have to explain to an interviewer why theres a hole in you resume for years while you essentially gambled like a degenerate wearing a monocule

these skills are not readily transferrable

edit

i gaurentee you not one of the replies in this thread has ever seen k in their bank account in cash they simply cannot comprehend that kind of money and what it means to put it at risk

they are trading kk accounts and trying to extrapolate their profits and emotions to k

it does not work like that

you dont need to watch it everyday it depends on your trading style

people dont join this group to be told they should become programmers

some people can easily make  a month it depends on the skills theyve developed as a trader its definitely not easy but it is possible

this is a game that can be played by anyone you dont need k to make money if you are good enough you can get a funded account for a few hundred dollars you can also flip accounts its riskier but still possible

these skills are not readily transferrable  you are absolutely wrong about this there are skills that you learn while studying forex and strengthening your psychological skills you must not have learnt them yet

just because youve blown your accounts doesnt mean other people cant achieve things you consider unrealistic

respectively this is a subreddit where people can ask questions and learn your reality and everyone elses isnt the same","i know a couple of people personally that make way more that k a monththat started with  more or lessnot k

trading,Forex,Trading is too much,hi guys i am a full time forex trader using prop firms such as ftmo i am funded for k and am actually making good money but i find it so stressful i dont know what to do because its taken me  years to get to this point and im glad to of finally made it but my god the stress is awful anyone got any ideas,52,going to a job is stressful too,"step  take a break right now minimum  full trading week sundaysaturday take a whole month off if you are really so stressed out that its debilitating you cannot trade effectively if youre stressed out any more than you would be going to the gym you need to take the time to give your nervous system a break and a chance to heal and reset

step  make a plan to limit all of your entries to a small window each day forex is a  market and you cannot give your nervous system and the rest of your body the ability to relax if you are trading at any time throughout the day all willynilly with no consistent rhythm personally i will only enter a trade during the hour window before and after ny open from amam est or the minute window when tokyo is opening if i find a good swing trade opportunity you need to get very regimented and develop a regular consistent and cyclical schedule that is intentionally limiting theres no structure that holds people together in the market so you have to create that structure for yourself

step  lower your position sizes so that you stop feeling stressed out on a tradebytrade basis no arbitrary risk   trade number matters at all until your size is small enough that you wouldnt be phased even if you lost  trades in a row in some worst case scenario much less one single trade which is where youre at now

this is a simple step system that will eliminate a huge portion of the unnecessary stress that you have been accumulating dayin and dayout for as long as  years these are the things that i did that took me from being constantly stressed out and insanely emotional to being consistently profitable monthovermonth with minimal stress and negativity attached its easy as hell to follow because it requires doing less work not more if you follow the guide you wont want to revert to old ways because youll be making more money with less work and most importantly less stress

 trading has a very low barrier for entry meaning almost anyone can start trading right away knowing practically nothing

very few professional fieldscareers that can pay a lot have this low of a barrier you cant just do brain surgery from day one in medical school you cant play for a professional sports team on Grupo Televisa S.A. (TV) when youve never played the sport before 

so people accept that it takes years and incredible amounts of effort to make it in those traditional fields however because the barrier to trading is low many assume that somehow doesnt apply to trading when it very much does

 trading requires you to completely change the way your psychology works at a very deep level and most people either cant handle it or dont want to

many things in trading run counter to both our societal conditioning as well as our natural instincts these things are incredibly challenging to change and its an intense and long process to reconfigure them such as to become profitable many just dont have it for doing that or dont deem it worthwhile

 many people start on this path assuming they can get rich quick and easy so when they find out its not quick nor is it easy they simply quit and move on to the next shiny thing

you really have to have a passion for trading to make it to the point where youre actually able to make yourself wealthy many do not have a passion for trading and just want a shortcut once they see its not they quickly move on to another get rich quick scheme",psychology is key learning to read the charts takes years of practice then once it clicks youll be able to foretell where the markets will lead without looking at charts all day

i have a couple of questions before i start paper trading it  

 i understand you can get leveraged out the wazoo but i dont have to right  like if i want to risk  i realize i am actually risking  of my own money because of leverage but if i have a k account and lose x in a row that doesnt mean i have actually lost k because of some weird thing i misunderstood correct

 with the  major currency pairs this should give a trade signal every few days i would imagine if i am using a longer term chart as my signal  my question here is it worth trading the inverse  if i get a short signal on usdcad does that mean i should also risk  of my account by going long cadusd  i feel like this is a stupid question and maybe i am not understanding it properly but this is the exact same trade right  why would i bother shorting one and longing the other besides effectively doubling down on my position so i am doubly correct or doubly wrong  what am i missing

 what is the spread like typically  in stocks and options i try to trade things that have about a low spread high liquid underlying if i am trading a swing  is this possible in forex when trading during the peak overlap hours or do i need to get used to a whole other world of hurt where i can expect substantial slippage on both ends of the trade

 yes youd be opening the same trade again and i dont see the point also its  major pairs not sure if it was a typo

 if youre trading higher timeframes largely irrelevant except at session rollover pm est with most brokers youll rarely find spreads higher than  pips often going under  pip in liquid times also keep in mind that spread only makes sense relative to volatility  assets with higher spreads usually move more pips as well meaning that at the end of the day the impact spread has on your trade will always be a small percentage slippage and gaps are extremely rare in forex","i would recommend going through the babypipscom course its free and while you obvious have trading experience that will give you the advantage over the other new traders you still lack a basic understanding of forex

if the crash is unusual it is because you do not pay attention to low timeframes  huge crashes where there are large shifts of price compared to prior volatility is an everyday occurrence on the lower timeframe  all you need is for the higher timeframes to act upon the lower everyday you find when the  hour expresses itself upon the  minute  now once you are comfortable with these so called flash crashes you can learn what happens after a large drop and how to trade them avoiding momentum based trades that will lose you money no audusd is not going to drop in the next  hours you know who you are that posted that and youre a coward for deleting your reddit post since you were wrong

the markets are logical dont blame it for your own mistakes",6,deleted,there is no justification for price to fall the way it did in a matter of minutes what happened was not logical at all it was manipulation done during a holiday in japan on purpose when there was lower liquidity than normal and when some markets were closed this was done on purpose and probably through coordinated action,this is hindsight
underlying stock price,Forex,Prevalence of Technical Analysis,"hello 
i am just breaking into the fx market and drawing together potential strategies to use iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) noticed that a lot of posts here regard solely the priceaction when discussing trades my question is is technical analysis and simple priceaction monitoring enough to devise a profitable strategy 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been doing past trend analysis based solely on technicals and while deliberately avoiding news and it seems like certain trends are definitely predictable without needing an underlying understanding of the fundamentals 

this would make sense in my opinion since currencies are much stronger than stocksoptions and are backed by literal countriesregions so i cant imagine too much movement would result from fundamentals unless it was particularly catalyzing news so most traders would defer to technical data and trading instead am i correct in this reasoning",2,"yep price action is enough to make a profitable strat 

from a previous comment it looks like original poster came from options trading so i would strongly advise you to focus more on your risk management criteria as this will be the biggest factor in the two markets if you will

to be honest i think risk and trade management are the keys to profitability everyone is wrapped up about trying to get perfect entries or  win rates but thats less important to longevity in this game in my opinion",deleted,nan

stock market crash,Forex,How would a big stock market crash impact forex?,nan,11,"in all sorts of ways depending on what breaks and what country the money that gets pulled out of equities needs to go somewhere and probably because the person that pulled it out found a better place for their money or are worried to lose it and stick it in another currency  if you look at what happend to the currencies during major crashes like that of  you will see all stock markets pretty much went down but you can see which currencies strengthen because of that dip and which currencies fell 

just look how strong the jpy got after  it crushed pretty much everything even though the nikkei also tanked gold went to the moon and people were desperately looking for havens to hedge against crazy inflation 

remember currency is the life blood of everyone and every business and equities are a strong force in our economy what ever stocks do the currency will react because the money starts to zip around

its a lot deeper than that and macroeconomics is not an easy beast to understand so these are huge over simplifications",iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) made a killing buying gold yesterday and today let the market go down,"in some of the smaller nontraditional pairs a key indicator is the gap in preformance between the two stock markets for example if you were trading the korean won vs the vietnamese dong you would look at the index preformance of each stock market weeklydally gains lets say the korean index is up  while the vietnamese market is flat you could expect the korean won to appreciate in that pair

stock market crash,Forex,If the American & Canadian Stock Markets Crash.... Forex?,"hello im a newbie investor iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been hearing a lot about how the stock markets are being supported by printed money in both Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) and canada while they try to keep everyone afloat during these strange times there are growing whispers that many other newbie investors are entering the markets and are being fed false hope about easy gains as the market recovers when the real crash is potentially yet to come also the printed money is going to lead to inflation but theres a lag time before we feel the effects so iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been wondering with both a stock market crash and the effects of inflation just around the corner is using forex a viable strategy to protect my money

for example if i converted all my cad to the south korean wan before the inflation hits and assuming business proceeds more or less as usual in south korea would that be a way to protect my money im a noob so im hoping someone can point out any fatal flaws in this idea

by the way the only thing i know about south korea is that their unemployment numbers are low their covid cases are low and their lock down restrictions relative to canadausa are low meaning their economy probably wont be hit as hard as others

is converting to a stable foreign currency a good way to protect my unstable currency",1,"easy way to think about it

there are  asset classes  equities debt commodities currency

you always either converting  to the other  when you buy stocks youre  selling your currency and youre long stockscurrency

if there was a stock crash your currency would likely appreciate since people are selling stockscurrency

the caveat is if some other nations stocks are crashing more and soaking up their supply of currency faster then your currency will go down against theirs

ie i can tell you what currency is doing by looking at equity indexes but i cant tell you what equity indexes are doing by looking at currency pairs","i think youre confusing on how trading is done on the stock market vs the forex market

unlike the stock market you can only make money as the stock goes up in value in forex you can make money both ways in forex trading buying and selling 

your base currency will always be protected essentially because the only thing that matters in forex trading is when youre actually in a trade 

protecting your equity and margin is the ultimate goal

to give you an example

lets say i trade in canadian dollars and the canadian dollar drops  value against the usd if i decided to trade a sell usdcad meant to put cadusd i can still make money as the value goes down and as the value drops i will be paid in usd 

also trading on a weaker currency technically means you gain more profit",real estate physical gold gold etfs bitcoin etc are ways to hedge against a double wammy of economic downturn with an inflating currecy with a forex broker like oanda you can convert your local currency into any currency they support i used to run my balance in aud so it would be entirely possible to just bank in a foreign currency if you want the risk of course is if the other currency loses against your local currency when you want to access your  money a fukushima type of event could wreck your plan and you will pay conversion fees
stock market crash,Forex,USD and the stock market.,"so iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) just got a quick question

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) got a feel theres a generel idea that despite the highs on the stock markets the economy and inflation is slowing 

i know the usd is a haven but why in times of a slow economy is it considered more safe than the euro 

i know nothing is for sure but am i reading things wrong when i intrepet it as the eurusd would be bearish in case of a slower economy 

as quite new to this i would imagine and consider the euro quite strong aswell and with low interest rates",5,i would speculate that when the us economy is slowing down so is everyone else the us kind of pulls other economies with it so if everyone slows down even if it a result of the us economy the dollar would still be considered safe,usd is worlds reserve currency and most commodities are traded in terms of the dollar as well as international business deals being denominated in usd so in times of global tensions or turbulence it makes sense that investors would flee from riskier assets to safer ones such as usd,or does it relate to global trading is often usd based
stock market crash,Forex,"Market Prediction Algorithms for the US Dollar, the Stock Market and Bitcoin","this book provides an intricate example of how to apply pattern recognition to the daily prediction of tradeable financial assets like eurousd and bitcoinusd i demonstrate how the only way to be able to predict the price movement on a daily basis is by strictly using variations in positions of the  moon  sun  mercury   lunar nodesand setting those variations within different parameters that call for predictions of either a price rise or fallusing parameters that call for predictions of either up or down based on variations of the position of the sun moon mercury and lunar nodes one can find significant patterns that could lead to predicting accurately a tradeable financial asset on a daily basis for a long period of timepossibly leading to a holy grail algorithm or holy grail theory of daily trading via quantitative analysis

the book also demonstrates how the dow jones industrial average follows a pattern based on the position of the sun and lunar nodes the basic gist of the algorithm decrees that from the point when the degree of the sun is  degrees pastor higher than the degree of the lunar nodein any sign all the way until the degree of the sun enters a new sign at the th degree markusing western astrology a prediction of a market upswing should be applied from the point when the degree of the sun enters a new sign at the th degree mark all the way until the degree of the sun goes  degrees past the degree of the lunar nodein any sign the prediction of a market downswing should be applied

the final volume contains the percentage United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) and downs of the btcbitcoinusd currency pair during times when the sun and mercury are in the same sign and also during times when the sun and mercury are in different signs these statistics go back to  my initial observation would conclude that there is a higher prevalence of a rise in btcusd when the sun and mercury are in different signs and a higher prevalence of a drop when the sun and mercury are in the same sign mercury retrograde periods however seem to reverse that pattern making it to where the sun and mercury in different signs would drive the btcusd lower while the sun and mercury in the same sign during the retrograde would bring it higher",1,blackhole sun wont you come and wash away the gains,nan,nan

anyway fuck this nonsense and try to code  use some binary options strategies on tradingview backtest there are few indicators  strategies you can fork your own from

then you will understand that its not that easy to find really working strategy or method then you can reach out to some programmer and they can make you your own bot or you can just trade by alerts manually but this time you will know that it should work

also never trade otc and always have chart of same asset from tradingview so you can verify its really valid

look at the data what happens most the time does it retrace   ok now you got an average retracement level so what happens if you enter a trade  minutes after news could you reliably make a few pips without risking too much

the answer is yes but you got to crunch the data hard trading has far too much money involved for this to be easy and the people with the good rd information arent giving it out its human nature no one else cares if youre rich or not anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something","the markets reaction to news and the reaction afterwards could be the subject of someones lifes work and is the subject of the way some people make their living

that said postevent price trajectories for an individual news event can be quite easy to explain its just that to make more comprehensive statements about all the different variations would take a lot longer

the fastest way to get a feel for this thing is just to watch the news events in real time however dont just passively watch them

 find out what the expected values are for the news event

 make careful note of the different components of the news event eg headline figure with sub data headline announcement with written press release etc

 make notes about where you think the limiting structures sr are within the market

 see if you can determine how aggressive a bull move vs a bear move might be once you realise that news events are not necessarily symmetrical youll be ahead of the vast majority of people here

 look to see if you can find certain phases price goes through

 turn on tick volume read up on wyckoff and stopping volume if youre not familiar with this concept

 try to pick the bottomtop you dont necessarily want to try and jump on there but its the best way to begin to read price in the ticker tapedom style

 turn on bidask so you can watch the spread expand and compress","news are basically fuel to the market

price,Forex,Paid my price for not setting stoploss.,"its been around  months since i started trading forex i was lucky to find my strategy that worked out for me i was able to see good profits but it was never consistent

made good profits but then losses were also equal at the end of every month although i identify risk management is the root cause i still didnt set the stoploss for every trade that i took

i trade using a break from the support and resistance area of interest if anybody knows how to set stoploss for this method pls let me know

 i do swing trading and i had no problem watching the charts all the timethough i knew this will turn against me one day i just kept going

reasons i didnt set the stoploss were that

 i was always unsure of where i should set my stoploss i thought maybe if i set it here it would only cause unwanted loss to my trade
 this one is new i was emotionally attached to my trade i know this sounds strange but it was the hope that maybe if i hold longer market will go in my favour which it did happen in few cases but it didnt happen in many and resulted in huge loses

so today it finally went against me i took around  trades every thing was going as expected but today eurjpy suddenly went down and resulted in huge losses and led to all of my trades being squared off and yes you guessed right my account blew up and now im in a loss of  which is such a huge amount to me

im bit devastated because i figured out everything except the one main thing stoploss

gonna take a break and figure out everything and come back to trading once again im not at a good position financially and dont want to give up lesson learnt",12,and thats why you need a sl kids,sir you have bigger issues than a stoploss your position was too big,i think even with sl once the japanese central bank intervened the price action happened so quick so your fill in the sl would have still been bad

everything we need to know is there in the candles and the patterns they form

share price,Forex,What is the mechanism that drives forex price up or down?,in stocks you have a limited supply of shares so at some point you run out of shares available at x price and you have to move on to the next higher priced shares for all intents and purposes isnt the available currency to trade basically unlimited  it seems like there would be more than enough available currency and would never budge the price i have tried googling this answer and have found nothing any help would be appreciated,25,"you also have to look at this on a global macro level for example coca cola australia has to pay a license fee to coca cola on a monthly basis this contract requires payment in usd coca cola AngloGold Ashanti Limited Brands, Inc.

(AU) estimates this payment to be an average of m per month they employ xyz global bank to purchase the usd at the most optimal time in order to not be subjected to fluctuations if usd is cheaper in february coca cola AngloGold Ashanti Limited Brands, Inc.

i think price will go up it goes down i think it will go down it goes upi setup sl it turns into ur TPG, N.V. (TP) i do it all","in any market with any financial instrument the only thing that moves prices directly are the bidders and askers 

everything else mentioned in the other comments are only secondary what drives people to bid or ask the prices up and down

your initial post about supply running out at a certain price therefore you have to bid lower or ask higher can be applied to any market

its easy to imagine think of some market moving event what if the market existed but there were no people around humor me for a second no one would bid or ask the prices up or down the market wouldnt move at all people move the market clicking buttons that is all

you can even do this or test this in a thin market go find a super thin market buy or sell a bunch you just moved the market 

now on any liquid market this is happening s of time per second

share price,Forex,What is your strategy?,would you like to share your trading strategy here and id like to know why are there so many strategies out there why cant we just trade based on highs and lows why do we need to draw this line mark that area and wait for price to hit a certain level when we know that price wont do what we expect it to do  of the time likethe price moves differently on different pairs but we use the same strategy to trade them and expect price to move the way as our analysis says why like how can you trade usdtry using the strategy for eurusd for example,2,if you just want to trade based on highs and lows but price doesnt move as you expect  of the time does that seem like a good idea do you think that drawing a line or marking an area where you expect price to reach is just busy work with no purpose or utility then dont do it if you know of a different way to improve your probability of making a successful trade then use that instead as for why there are so many strategies out there if you show  people a piece of art how many interpretations of the piece do you expect to hear same goes for a chart interpretation is subject to perception and i very much doubt two people are ever going to perceive something the exact same way  of the time genetic twins dont even behave in the same way so why wouldnt there be a lot of strategies to help interpret a chart that could be interpreted millions of different ways,"if you can guess this then you know

buy high  sell low",the reason why one strategy can be effective with multiple instruments across the market is because price movements ultimately are based on psychological levels which are areas on a price chart that other traders in the market would typically react to when price gets there there are areas on the price chart of any given asset in the market that are virtually guaranteed to cause some type reaction from most participants in said market when price gets there the only job you have is to determine whether you think its going to go up or down from that point  at the end of the day no matter which instrument youre speculating on what moves the price of that asset is liquidity and developing the skill of looking at a price chart and being able to identify where the liquidity lies by locating these psychological levels waiting for price to get there and then entering a position that doesnt conflict with your directional bias is a strategy that will make you money in any market you choose to participate in

share price,Forex,"What do you mean when you say ""trade with the trend"" ?","this statement is completely ridiculous because there are many many trends happening at a time the weekly trend could be up but the daily could be down with the monthly up and yearly down none of that makes any sense by definition if you buy for a price above the avg theres a higher likelihood that it will mean revert and you will lose the trade an arbitrary trend line cannot predict anything but the previous trend and by the time a trend is obvious it is bound to reverse

heres a secret the more people that see a trend the higher the probability that it will reverse information thats common knowledge has no value in trading its as if you were watching where someone was walking lets say they walked north for  mile just because theyve walked north for a mile doesnt mean theyre going to keep going that direction in contrast it probably means theyre about to change direction rather than continue

actual trend statistics for those who care",0,the trend is you friend if you catch it early,what timeframe are you actually executing your trades on would you look at the monthly chart if you were trading on the  minute no i dont think you would the market has sentiment as you can see in your chart and that sentiment can be short term or long term even if the market does mean revert is that mean stationary or does it fluctuate as price does the market experiences different cycles  bullish bearish and ranging so in an uptrend maybe you should be buying when the market retraces  theres your mean reversion you can surprisingly do the same thing in a ranging market your job is to determine what cycle were in,i disagree with this premise its why we use multiple time frame analysis to evaluate not just the overall trend but micro trends knowing the overall sentiment is a hedgeconfluence knowing if youre stuck in a range or trending is trading

 while some brokers offer otc vanilla options that you trade against them as the counterparty they are often very limited in selection and have wide spreads youll have a hard time paying the fair price that means implied fair value or being filled at a price between the bid and ask going the otc route at a retail fx broker because theyll likely only execute when you cross the spread or the market moves through your order sadly until theres more competition on the retail level for otc vanilla options this is not gonna change examples here are ig and saxo neither i would recommend so stick with points  and  for exchange traded options

so if its not looping in the code to monitor the market price it will only ever change the sl once so you have to activate it each time you want to move an sl for an order",thats an interesting concept for an sl script i will definitely consider developing a tool for that though i probably wont get to do it this year,"if you google for set fixed sl and TPG, N.V.

daily tf form a bias

h identify structure and where youd be looking to buysell

m wait for an entry signal at your area of interest
 
 

each of these steps should have its own set of criteria its your job to find what works for you","all i do is trade engulfing candles on h timeframe coming off  and  ema buy when  above  and sell when  below 

you can get fancy with this by adding some weekly levels or rsi and look for some divergences but you dont have to just engulfing coming off  and 

you can experiment with your tf and emas but h works best for me not too slow not too fast","from my experience trying live some algos i have worked on first thing is to notice a pattern that repeats frequently and does not depend so much on market changes for example in my case it is breakouts of recent pivot highs and lows write some very specific rules for example consider a pivot high or low when it is the highestlowest in a set of  bars then consider a break when price reaches that exact level or a pip abovebelow etc and then backtest it thats how i have been doing it and so far even though i am still testing it live but it is working

basically you first need some type of behaviour or pattern that you notice repeats often and then set rules and backtest that is the only way to define a consistent strategy never break your rules and if you took the time to backtest it and forward test it then you know the stats and what you can expect 

work on patterns that repeat across several types of assets so you have more flexibility and diversity"
trading strategy,Forex,My Trading Strategy and Setup,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been trading for  years and have been finding some success this year and now starting to get comfortable with the setups i look for i started with fx and later added a variety of cfds for spx metals commodities and bonds not here to tell you guys how to trade nor am i looking for critique on my strategy i posted this on my profile but figured id share my story here as it might be interesting for new traders

a trading strategy is ever evolving and never finished especially if you can surround yourself with other like minded traders and you collectively try to get better i went from basic ma crosses on the  and min to high probability setups on the weekly and monthly

my nr indicator

the bollinger bands got me excited right off the bat when i started backtesting them my strategy is to look for candles that greatly overextend outside of the upper or lower band and then counter the move as they will often shoot back in like an elastic band as candles like to stay within the bands

i look for these setups on the weekly and monthly chart as the shorter tfs give a lot of poor signals an overextension on the  hour will only need a bit of consolidation and maybe a minor pullback before it can easily continue its trend

its always hard to say how far an overextension will go look at the ng rogue wave and how long it will take before it pulls back in to tackle this challenge i scale in with one small position at a time and trading the cfd makes this very easy as you can trade a really small size when needed i jump in too early almost every single time as i dont want to miss the move but thats fine as the positions are small with wide stops

pullback or reversal

you cant just blindly trade every setup of course but by following these moves on the higher tfs theres ample time to research fundamentals and such to determine where price might go and if were trading a pullback or reversal i treat every trade initially as just a temporary pullback then later on if its starting to look like a possible reversal i might set some positions at be to let those ride

other tools i use

another trusted indicator is the macdrsi crossover these are highly lagging but plotting them on the daily and weekly gives me a pretty good sense of whether the directional pressure is up or down i also use mas historical sr price levels and round numbers that help with the entries and exits

like all indicators these arent generating guaranteed setups its just another piece of the puzzle but if enough pieces fit together the setups can get a very high probability

examples of the signals or setups i look for

here is an  where i marked the macdrsi crossovers the actual cross precedes the reversal and i dont act on that but once the macd line red exits the histogram grey bars the reversal happens or is already underway since were looking at a weekly chart were also working with large moves that can go on for weeks what i then do is only trade the direction the indicator gives me and keep scaling in and out with small positions and wide stops until the signal becomes weak or risky this chart is obviously a great hindsight example and not every cross signals a reversal but whenever this setup occurs the bells start ringing and i do my E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD)

silver just had a great bollinger setup overextended on the  and floating outside of the bands on the  still felt a little risky due to my lack of experience with silver but i scaled in  times and caught a large part of that retracement

the challenging bond shorts i started too early and cut yesterday are in hindsight just another monthly bollinger overextension that snapped right back down looking at  and 

i mostly trade these bollinger setups on the weekly and monthly so they dont occur that often which is why i follow a lot of instruments

i also try to trade with more conviction if i see a good setupthere is no point in being confident and have a small position  soros

cfd and swap

my trading fees are the spread and overnight interest swap i have more than  instruments open at any given time and a number of them have a positive swap if you trade them in a specific direction i make an effort to only trade the direction that earns me interest as i hate holding onto positions that eat into my profit every day i will only trade the other direction if the setup is good enough or if the overall interest on all open positions is positive

trading platform and hardware

i use Mittal Steel Company NV (MT) with a regular fx broker which gives me a wealth of pairs to choose from and a cfd for anything else im interested in i follow  fx pairs AGCO Corporation (AG) metals bonds spx oil and ng i have all of those up on a  monitor setup just like you see with those pro traders haha this is my work and hobby so i might as well make myself as comfortable as possible  for the trading rig nerds 

things to improve

taking profit can be a struggle and is often done too early i heavily shorted the ng rogue wave from the very top and more recently corn and silver seeing where they went is sometimes hard to stomach especially since they had a positive swap and there was no need to close the entire baskets i always tell myself to leave a few with a stop at be in case the move continues but i often have this overwhelming feeling of being satisfied and drained from the trade after holding for weeks that i just say fuck it and close the whole thing to be done with it and celebrate

the next one probably applies to more of you i have to watch for getting caught up in the excitement when things are volatile and overtrade spx which is my favorite daytradescalping instrument my stats show that  of this years profit is from trading spx so its been successful but its hard to stop trading when the volatility is there i have to learn when to shut it down and take a break

where to go from here

im not a big player so there is ample room to grow and i have been scaling things up lately

 why are you doing this i dont trade this strategy anymore due to a pivot in my trading objectives several years ago i learned the basic concepts from others so im giving back what iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) received it doesnt compete with my current style or the approach of the proprietary trading firm i work for this strategy has sat dormant on my computer for the better part of a decade so i figured why not dust it off and pass it on in terms of why now iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) noticed an uptick in strategy  questions on reddit and iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) started writing answers but stopped because its just too much for a single comment my plan is to reference this post in future interactions with traders
 how do we know this works i could show  and i could give  but at the end of the day all that can be faked my goal is to hand you something which works  provided you are looking for a method and are willing to put in the effort needed to make it work after reading this post there literally is nothing stopping you from adopting this backtesting it and trading it so let the method speak for itself

lets do this thing

strategy brief

in brief the strategy seeks to participate in an existing trend when momentum picks up in the direction of the trend initial stops are tight and are trailed with pullbacks until momentum ends i traded the strategy on the daily timeframe but it certainly could have been applied to others as well

   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended
   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended
   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended

there are two key concepts here  trend and momentum lets define them and then get into exact entry and exit techniques

trend

put simply a trend is when price is moving in a certain direction while price swings are in agreement with that general move

 uptrend  in an uptrend price swings are making higher highs and higher lowers  
 downtrend  in a downtrend price swings are making lower lows and lower highs  

the market doesnt always trend and there are ugly trends out there this strategy avoids those times in which the trend is not in force to only focus on environments which favor continuation of an existing trend

trend momentum

in any trend there is a cycle of with trend momentum followed by against trend momentum this forms the pattern of price pushing to fresh extremes in a trend followed by pullbacks against the trend

when the trend reexerts itself you tend to see an explosion of withtrend strength you can identify these points on a chart by big candles in the direction of the overall trend

   a downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of pullback and the continuation of the trend
   an uptrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and the continuation of the trend
   a downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and continuation of the trend

and thats really the conceptual backdrop of the strategy we find a trend that is in a pullback and look to enter on fresh momentum in the direction of the trend you can train your eyes to spot these patterns within a couple of hours of study its not rocket science

entry criteria

as per the entry the concepts spell out precisely when to look to enter the market find an uptrend look for a pullback then buy when you get withtrend strength

as per my specific entry criteria i entered with a stop above the market in an uptrend or below the market in a downtrend for example if i identified unfolding momentum in an uptrend i would set an entry order a few pips beyond the high to get me into the trade

   buy stop set above the momentum bar in the direction of the trend
   sell stop set below the momentum bar in the direction of the trend

exit initial stop

as you can see by   this strategy gets stopped out a lot

the reason for this is that i am seeking to capture the entire unfolding trend by risking only a small amount to maximize my average win  average loss ratio the goal here is to make the rewardrisk ratio such that when i actually captured a trend it would compensate me several times over for losing trades this is very much a trend following strategy designed to deliver outstanding returns when the market trends and scrape along when it doesnt so the initial stop loss is very tight so as to maximize the reward per unit of risk when the trend cooperates

for an initial stop loss i set it roughly halfway into the width of the momentum bar if the momentum bar is narrow in relation to the recent trading range then i would set the stop beneath the momentum bar

   stoploss set somewhere near the middle of the candle
   stoploss set somewhere near the middle of the candle

exit trailing profit

the stop loss remains in place until the market forms and completes a pullback in the trend when a pullback has been completed and the trend continues the stop loss is moved to the bottom of the pullback in an uptrend or the top of the pullback in a downtrend this process is repeated until the stop is hit and you are taken out of the trade in other words you have very high upside potential on each trade with constrained but much more probable risk

   trailing stops are set beneath pullbacks when a pullback completes by pushing into new highs this process is repeated until you are stopped out
   this looks complicated but its really not every time the market forms a pullback of  or more bars we wait until price closes beyond the pullback in the direction of the trend and then move our stop to the bottom of the pullback

risk management

to protect against losses i risked a firm  per trade if my initial stop was hit i would trade at such a size that i would lose  of my account balance no exceptions

the reason here is that with a trend following strategy under this riskreward framework you are going to lose a lot you need to ensure that you can survive  losses straight with minimal dent to your trading book and you only do this through risk management

indicators for screening

if you notice on my charts which show actual trades i had the  period moving average and the  moving average overlaid on the chart the reason for this is that i used the  period sma as an scanning indicator and the  as a general reference for the trend

  period sma  i used this indicator to screen for momentum bars example if todays close is the first close above the sma and were closing in the top  of the candle then visually inspect the chart to see if were in a trend and this is fresh momentum in the direction of the trend
  period sma  this indicator gave me a quick ataglance metric to give context to my trend analysis if i viewed price as in a trend i wanted it to be above the  as a loose confirmation that the general trend was indeed upwards

my primary focus was on price action find a trend trade fresh withtrend momentum when it appears and then ride the trend until it ends the indicators simply served as a helpful scanning tool and you can trade the method without them

practical considerations for real trading

practice and trade review

you have to internalize this to actually identify it in real time if you want to adopt this strategy you do this through backtesting and verification that your live testing is lining up with your backtest

 backtesting  i spent hundreds of hours dragging charts one bar at a time and recording trades that i would have taken if it were realtime on an ongoing basis i would backtest  backtrade the past decade of data for every instrument i traded this practically meant that i was spending  of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and  of my time actually trading if you havent quite figured out trading id suggest you put in serious effort into the area of backtest and intentional practice
 trade review  on an ongoing basis i would do a complete review of all of my trades to figure out how to sharpen my edge and to verify that i was perfectly trading my plan  no matter your strategy i believe trade review is crucial how will you know if youre making mistakes if youre not reviewing what youve done how will you know if you can do better if youre not carefully questioning each and every trade to try and get better this sheet has several more columns and was just one iteration of an ongoing review process

if this seems like a lot of work thats the point you are competing against some of the brightest minds in the world why would the market allow trading to be as easy as opening an app on your way to the beach to profitability trade you really need to invest heavily in  verifying that what youre doing has a history of making money and  verifying that youre actually executing in perfect alignment with your testing as well as looking for ways to improve performance youll always see the lucky dude flaunting his returns but for the vast majority of professional traders this is just scratching the surface of the types of analysis you need to do to monitor and improve your discretionary trading edge

psychology

theres no getting around it trading is psychologically difficult for many people my two silver bullets are an edge and a desire to succeed

 you must have an edge first off do you have an edge unless you have a either a demonstrated track record of making money or a backtest of your exact method showing that it makes money then youll probably have mental angst even with my trades resting on hundreds of hours of study and backtesting demonstrating the validity of my method it was still difficult to pull the trigger and take the next trade at times knowing i had a demonstrated edge is what gave me the confidence to overcome mental angst and put on the next trade
 you must have a desire to succeed and second bullet is this do you want to succeed if you have a demonstrated edge and have a rock solid conviction and drive to succeed then a lot of psychological issues take care of themselves i remember the pain of sitting in a prolonged drawdown after losing several trades in a row it was a defining moment for me it is a unique pain that words cant quite capture in the depths of the pain of losing trade after trade and in the process worrying if id lose my job i reminded myself that  i have an edge and  i really want to succeed at this so i picked myself back up and took the next trade and over the next few months i delivered some of my strongest returns and broke into new equity highs

in my opinion people get the cart before the horse in the territory of psychology trading gurus seem to suggest that if you get your mindset aligned money will just flow into your account thats simply not the case if the places in which you are buying and selling have zero demonstrated ability to actually make money step  get a demonstrated edge step  ensure youre able to act on that edge through proper psychology

an edge

the expected value equation is the foundation of trading put simply

 expected value  win percentage x average win size  loss percentage  average loss size

if that equation is negative you dont have an edge if its positive you have an edge if you play around with the math youll see that win ratio or average win  loss size in isolation are irrelevant you can have a high win ratio with large losers or a low win ratio with large winners and have the exact same mathematical edge the only thing youre varying is the distribution of your returns

my strategy detailed above is a positive skew strategy lots of small losses and a few very large wins you can adapt it by either larger stops or adding targets to change your distribution of returns the underlying edge is real markets trend and at certain points you can participate in them to outperform the baseline drift of the market how you size your targets and stops shapes the ultimate distribution of returns you will receive as you capture this edge

further reading

for those who have traded for a while everything i said above probably clicks and makes sense but if this was like me speaking an entirely different language heres some books that are simply excellent for discretionary trading

 the art and science of technical analysis  adam grimes this book will carefully show you how to read market structure and give strategies for trading it grimes is the realdeal and his antihype levelheadedness is much needed in trading literature if you can only afford one book make it this one
 the psychology of trading  dr brett steenbarger hands down the best psychology book out there in my view steenbarger a professional psychologist who has worked at the institutional level of trading is who fixed my thinking on trading psychology to where i focused on getting an edge first and foremost and then aligning my psychology so that i can act on my edge

conclusion

take it or leave it theres a complete discretionary trading strategy which was used at the professional level of the field of speculative fx trading this is one of many approaches out there and if youre looking for a strategy feel free to take this one and experiment with it best of luck in all of your endeavors",99,"great summary this is the real strategy for all you newbies out there

as you can see by my win ratio  this strategy gets stopped out a lot

 negative win rate and still profitable yes this is probably one of the only ways to consistently make money  you lose quite often but when you win you cover all your losses and some more  forget about strategies which have rr higher than  and winrate higher than 

 i was spending  of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and  of my time actually trading

 finally this is what trading is about  its a numbers game and a lot of awful boring and mentally exhausting work the actual trading  monitoring needs very little time entries are not that important especially all those sniper entries  that is just pure gambling and nothing more exit strategy is because noone knows how strong the trend will be once it starts who would say  days ago that gold would suddenly make  pips in a week

now the next step for this or any strategy would be to show people how to actually optimize the strategy optimization  finding optimal stop loss and take profit values for the data set created by the strategy expanding strategy to other assets this can be easily done in any sheets program like excel or google sheets once you enter all the data from backtest",we need more people to post stuff like this and not just Protective Life Corporation (PL) screenshots thanks for showing people a potentially useful strategy,i have a similar algo to trade like this even recently confirm it worked but it really depends on which instruments will get the most out of profit for me it will be us and us actually it will be the best if you can combine this breakout strategy with a mean reversion strategy to smooth out E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD)
trading strategy,Forex,"Is ""feeling it"" a trading strategy?",i mean you always hear you need to have strategy but i wonder if there is anyone else like me that kinda just feels it and enters based on gut feeling and some basic resistances,4,some argue its the only real way to be profitable i dont necessarily agree but i have had thoughts about those being profitable with systems are more dependant on their feel and experience than the actual system without  realizing it to the full extent themselves,"feeling is emotional a better way to describe it would be experience when you first start driving you will have to really focus to keep the car straight between the lines watch your mirrors and maintain speed once youve been driving for a while it becomes second nature youve gained experience like trading this doesnt apply to everyone

i started only trading nas i focused on high probability Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

i took a break during holiday szn and feb  i was back at the drawing board i began looking at nas gu eu and AngloGold Ashanti Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (AU) and how i could filter out the bad trades i always traded the m but now used h and m as confluence looking at highs lowsliquidity and gaps as profit targets rather than amount of money by march i realized the higher time frames confused me and i had no idea what a good vs bad trade was i backtested nas eu uj gu and every setup that occured from janmarch  constructed a trading plan and by may  was ready to forward test on only uj and gu but still record every trade from nas and eu as well to have more data 

my whole journey i had psychology trouble choosing what setups to take or avoid i will attach a pic of my trading plan and an example or  follow me on ig  shambpagne if you wanna see summaries of my trading since may but i was focused on removing the decision making in trading using data to create rules that filtered my trades so i could simply take every trade i saw that fit the criteria win or lose my psychology since has been great  recorded trades later the strategy has been profitable the past  months on paper averages around  trades a week survived a slump in junejuly wo losing most of profits gained in aprilmay and has been tweaked a lil bit based on the data i have analyzed 

that all sounds good but have i been profitable forward testing this strat not exactly in may i was breaking rules and in most of junejulyaugust i was moving into an apt travelling working and only back tested i have forward tested all sept  and realized i havent been tracking news and it can only really be recorded when you forward test and see the affects realtime so im sure a nice chunk of the profits iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) recorded wouldnt exist Brunswick Corporation (BC) of news i never took news into account since it seemed to go in my favor almost just as much as it didnt since iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been forward testing and holding my trades through news i realize its not realistic to think i will be able to consistently take profits in the mere seconds i have during a news candle or that i wont lose more money than my sl says i will cus volatility i decided to just start closing trades right before news hits but i also realized commissions are kinda fucking me over i was up about  this past week on paper risking trade but only actually made  theres no way of telling in the  trades i recorded how much profits wouldve been erased from commissions but obviously a nice chunk it seems

so now here i am rethinking the past  months i have spent dialing in on this strategy im comfortable using wondering how much of it was a waste i dont really want to switch strategies and have another learning curve my data shows that theres only a couple more ways to filter out bad trades and increase win around  rn but i know the filtering would require me to start making decisions and could hurt my psychology and it honestly doesnt seem worth it since i would lose alot of profits on paper for a small win increase i have heard there are no commissions for trading nas but my strat straight up sucks on nas and i cant go back to what i was doing before since it wasnt working i understand swing trading would kinda eliminate this problem but i hate swing trading im a scalper at heart

i am going to keep forward testing the strat and i do still have confidence i will have enough profits in the long run to cover for all the commissions but it is a bit troublesome anyone else dealt with this issue any advice on what to do moving forward assuming my strat wont provide enough in the long term 

too long; didn't read i trade supplydemand zones using liquidity and gaps as targets on uj and gu on the m the strategy i have built around my psychology over the years takes about  trades a week and im recently realizing commissions might be my downfall

in the picture iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG)  aggressive entry tapping a zone boc  break of candle reversal confirmation",0,i see you mention news few times often news doesnt change the trajectory but merely provides volatility or fuel to fire should always be aware of whats going on just a general observation but if you are having trouble with commissions maybe you are overtrading have you tried increasing your time frame or limiting your trading in some way can take a long time of fine tuning to match your personality with the market when finding your way dedication commitment and patience can help guide you,"there is this one article online that stood out to me completely and really helped me find the best setups only take a supply and demand trade when the supply is extremely clearim talking consecutive solid candle colors for the supply thats created and for the demand also that is created before entry there must be a very clear demand that is created before considering entry not all that liquidity crap and then some candle touching the zone must be clear as day and if its not clear on the min could be more clear on the  min or min but min is always the timeframe where i start i wont even take a setup if there is a candle of the opposite color interferring with the supply or demand iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) never seen this talked about anywhere besides this only article on google and it definitely helps to not overtrade iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also started implementing daily bias so the direction of the sd zone has to be in line with that because if its not more than likely the setup will fail and not reach liquidity of the zone where i take profit since my setups have become so selective i do have to trade on more than one pair i ignore news except National Financial Partners Corporation (NFP) i have noticed any setup that looks good on that day does more than likely fail or zones just fail and dont even get touched 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been following doyle for awhile on ig and watch his stories everyday to see if we had similar setups iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) pretty much figured out his strat just from studying sd myself and his tips he says in his vids some trades he does definitely has me scratching my head like when he takes a demand trade to a supply i dont even want to try getting my head wrapped around that laugh out loud but for exiting early i had to learn how to do that on my own as well as his vid describing that if you did what he did youd have a ton of losses and miss out on winning trades it looks like he cuts them as soon as a candle goes in opposite direction before it even closes but thats how the market flows and if your setup is good most of the time that candle wont close above your entry candle

my stop loss is above the zone and i close early if any candle closes above the open of my entry candle has cut my losses down by less than half instead of taking a full hit your welcome for that one laugh out loud

i have a lot of rules that i havent listed here but i think thats honestly what it takes having a lot of clear and defined rules so theres no guessing

its been my experience that trading anything under the m chart is way too much trouble than its worth precisely because of commissions and spreads and personally i rarely trade under the  hour

i usually ignore news unless its something of vital importance like a national bank making some huge announcement even then im just slightly more cautious"
trading strategy,Forex,Tweaking trading strategy,sooo iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been on a losing streak and trying to come back and figure out what could be fixed i trade every pair so one of the things i think i could do is reduce it to maybe  or  to avoid doubling on the correlated pairs i trade the same set up every time to align with my plan as well as to build consistency its a simple fibonacci retracement where i use the  as my reversal zone and the  as the sl is there any other confluences i could add to increase the win rate or avoid being faked out,1,have you backtested the strat for atleast  years and gathered data on whether it is actually profitable or not,what session are you trading i would personally stick to one pair and learn the characteristics of it also what timeframe are you executing trades on,nan

 how did you hedge your option positions other options or deltagamma hedging or a combination of both

 at what time of the day did you start trading right at the open or did you wait until volatility has subdued slightly maybe like  min after open or even later

 where did you get your fair ivol skewssurfaces from did you have a data provider or did you calculate your own if so which method did you use eg heston  residuals splines 

 how many options did you trade concurrently and where did you get your live options data from

 did you trade wayotm options eg strike  puts or calls when spot is at something like  as well or did you only concentrate on a certain moneyness range

options market,options,do options market makers trade underlying only regarding delta neutrality?,or may a market maker actually trade option to reach that delta neutral state thanks,3,we do both and it often depends on what product youre trading in treasuries delta is almost always hedged with futures this is because the market moves so quickly that you need a system that automatically hedges options trades as they happen iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) never done market making in equities personally but i imagine its the same in other markets like eurodollars you have a combination as there are liquid futures but also lots of resting orders to trade against since the futures dont move as quickly as treasuries you can usually do either that being said its much much more common to just hedge via the underlying in most every product though trading options for delta is not unheard of at all,"no were not restricted its better to have access to more liquidity and that can be in optionsfuturesstock or elsewhere depending on what risks need to be hedged

throwaway because some of my coworkers may recognize my username

edit figured id add a pros and cons list

pros
 the work is highly stimulating and the days fly by although i do work  hours a day mondayfriday
 the compensation is very generous a first year trader at my firm makes k while a full time trader at my firm can make anywhere from km partners can make more
 the culture is very work hard play hard which for me is a pro
 the people are extremely smart and push each other to work hard generally trading firms recruit from ivys or schools with very strong academics i personally did not go to an ivy but i did go to a good state school from which many trading firms recruit

cons
 this was also in the pros list but the days can be long and occasionally quite stressful
 trading isnt risk less and firms can go under especially when vol skyrockets like it did in march
 not much diversity most of my firm is white or asian males not many women and not many people of color
 some firms can be highly cutthroat and competitive thankfully mine is not thats not to say it isnt competitive but people have the best interests of the firm in mind however iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) heard of other firms firing half of their new hires within  months of hiring if they dont perform",136,"ok so basically nothing that you do at your firm can actually be used or is relevant outside of it and you pretty much are a wholesale trader in the market who enjoys preferential prices and thats were you your edge comes from meaning you dont think of the market in the same way the general public does like which stock goes updown potential for growth even news none of that is actually having a great impact on your trading right 

you simply buy low sell high and base that decision on your experience software models and timing right",what kind of strategies does a trader use  why work for a market maker and not go solo,"what underlyings is your firm most active in

some brokers might give you tier  Circuit City Stores, Inc. (CC) and csp and might give you tier  long options but i dont know who would until you have a source of income"
options market,options,Careful using Merrill Lynch MarketPro for options trading! Please read...,"im an ultrahigh net worth client at merrill lynch for the record  this morning i logged into the website as well as marketpro and saw that i was down k but the website showed i was down k and the rep i was speaking to showed i was down k  this is upon hitting refresh at the same exact time 

about Swiss Exchange (SIX) months ago i reported simple calculation errors in values of positions in options i had some cash secured puts that showed i was up almost  when i was actually down quite a bit  i then saw a glaring mistake where they were multiplying a negative number by a negative number and inaccurately reporting gains when there were losses  merrill acknowledged and admitted these errors and said they would be corrected within  days  instead they just removed the expanded dropdown data on options across marketpro its been Swiss Exchange (SIX) months and it is still not corrected  

this should not happen lets say youre checking your bank account balance on an app and on a website at the same time  it should be reporting the same value no matter what im so frustrated with this i dont know what to trust  theyve admitted these issues in writing and in recorded telephone communications theyve asked how much iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been damaged so that they can make me whole but for me its nearly impossible to calculate the losses from these calculation errors because of the nature of options premiums moving so much

can others check marketpro and the website at the same time and see how close you are  especially if youre trading in options  im curious to see if you have very different values being reported im sitting at differences that range between  sometimes this is truly terrifying  i dont need dollar values but would be very interested in knowing what  youre off especially in your total options positions 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) reached out to two law firms in new york who are interested in representing me and who may be interested in a class action lawsuit  if this is happening for others id love to know  itll be pretty easy to see if theres a data mismatch  go to marketpro refresh your options positions at the same time as youre refreshing your holdings on the merrill website if its wildly different as it is in my case then we have a problem right now i just hit refresh and im down  on marketpro and  on the website  same when im on up days too just doesnt even come close to matching

options market,options,Overview of SPY Options Market for this week.,"the fed is in a quandary  inflation isnt dropping as they would want to and at the same time the us economy seems to keep pushing forward some investors believe that jpows dovishness may turn back to hawkish mode last week the ai battle between microsofts sydney and googles bard turned into a rakeintheface contest it seems that the tech rally is aimed at halting in its tracks

this is what we can see as the general feel from the options markets

 the long  day double exponential moving average dema is about to catch up with the short  day one when this happens the tendency is to go on a downward trend



 the price momentum of spy keeps cooling off the momentum is calculated by subtracting the short dema minus the long dema at the moment it seems that we are headed towards a negative momentum characterised by a drop in price



 the  day annualised volatility is at its lowest point since last august statistically the tendency of the volatility will be to move up above the first purple line percentile line we may be gearing up towards a higher volatility with  a downward pressure



xb

 in the option markets expiring this friday feb  spy continues being overwhelmingly bearish in sentiment the sentiment has been trending slightly more positive since feb th however there is just too much put open interest right now



xb



xb

 for spy option contracts expiring feb  we can see a very clear resistance level forming at strike  there are currently almost k open contracts at this point the reason why this can be a resistance level is that in general market makers are at the other side of any opened trade since most traders are long traders ie buyers of options  it is reasonable to assume that at the other side of the k contracts are market makers the game theory would lead us to see that the mms will try to avoid printing k contracts equal to m units of spy if they can somehow suppress the price enough this is a subjective method to identify resistance levels and should be used with discretion the reliability of this method gets stronger as we get closer to expiration date



 for spy option contracts expiring feb  we can see that there are two significant support levels at  and  both with k put contracts open at each strike the reasoning for calling it a support level follows a similar logic as with the resistance level except that we use puts instead of calls to make this assessment this is a subjective method to identify support levels and should be used with discretion the reliability of this method gets stronger as we get closer to expiration date it is also worth noting the gargantuan concentration of open put contracts at strike  this seems like an end of days type of play



xb

 next we evaluate what we refer to as a delta dam this is also a subjective metric that should be used with discretion a delta dam simply tell us how much money is required by market makers in order to fully hedge all the positions up to a specific strike remember that market makers do something called dynamic hedging which means that they are constantly evaluating their positions and increasing or reducing the size of their hedges depending on market conditions in the specific case for spy options expiring on feb  we can see that there is a jump of around b between strikes  and  if the strike is contested enough closer to expiration date what we expect to see is that market makers will suppress the price of spy instead of hedging it because the act of hedging calls itself pushes the price of the stock higher



xb

 for spy call contracts expiring on feb  we can see that market makers are currently hedging strikes  through   with more than m units of spy this is important because if the price of spy starts to drop and isnt anywhere near  by friday then a lot of contracts for this strike will be closed which will lead mms to wind off their hedges which will further depress the price of spy this is also a subjective view based on hedging patterns by market makers



 from what we have seen spy seems to be entering an area of strong downward pressure",134,"inflation isnt dropping as they would want to

if the bulls cant say that a few good reports dont mean weve solved inflation then the bears cant say that a few bad reports mean inflation is persistent and unsolved

stocks,options,Best Covered Call Stocks,"i see a few others here are trading ccs who has some good ideas for Circuit City Stores, Inc. (CC) candidates right now lets share some ideas with the numbers

i trade wellknown companies with low stock prices and relatively low margin requirements i look for stocks where the bid for the weekly option is  or more of the current stock price

as always stocks and options involve risk and ccs are no different and this is not advice just discussion

right now x is trading at  the margin requirement etrade is   shares would require about  in capital the  call expiring on  has a bid of  this is almost a  return instantly and another  or so if it assigns the caveat here is that this is a near term high level for x and may come down i would caution against a large position here but x always pays a relatively good premium if you wait for it to come back down a bit from here

aa is another one of my regular ccs it is trading at  the margin requirement is also  meaning a  shares would require capital of about  the  call has a bid of  this is around a  return and another  if it assigns even though it pays a little less than x this price level is less elevated than x right now

i know these returns sound like nothing compared to wsb short squeezes but these are weekly returns and they add up quick i usually have  shares of x in my portfolio and regularly collect  in premium and extra when it assigns i use it to pay for some options and shares in wsb stocks like wkhs 

i think it is important to have an income strategy as well as a capital gains strategy use your income strategy to pay for the more speculative plays it hurts less if they dont work out",372,"i like Circuit City Stores, Inc. (CC) but i think selling puts would still be a better play if you get assigned then you can do Circuit City Stores, Inc. (CC) collect premiums both way",i own  shares of aht at  i sold  covered calls for july  at  strike thats  premium and max profit of  if it hits my strike price i plan on holding share for a very long time,i wheel  shares of x cost basis  usd will be called away this friday at  usd

(AAPL)","in my opinion i wouldnt sell csp with an account that small  if you stick to reasonable stocks you will be using  of your portfolio on one stock should you be assigned eg rklb sofi f chpt Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF) all in the  range

i started with a  account not that long ago and used pmccs to build it up and then started selling csps when i had enough to cover  positions",i would start with either selling credit spreads or pmcc with that capital size build it up until you can afford selling cspcc the reason is because with the capital size youre not going to have a lot of options when it comes to selling cspcc and most likely need to settle with high risky volatile stock unless you truly dont mind owning  shares of those companies at worst case the thing with spreads is you can sell spreads on good quality companies like faang and value by the way we have a discord focuses on selling options dm if youre interested

stocks,options,Overbought stocks fall faster and harder than oversold stocks rise?,"i cant empirically prove this although i havent researched it extensively  not even sure where to start but after years of observation it seems to me that when a stock thats overbought reverses it tends to fall harder and faster than an oversold stock starts to climb

if you believe this assertion then it would follow that your best opportunity for profit on limited risk short term vertical spreads would be to seek out stocks that are highly overbought using rsi williams or something else and write your call credit spread above the current resistance level

thoughts",11,"while stocks going up do tend to go up slower they tend to go up for longer  when stocks fall fast it can seem like its coming out of the blue surprising people

when it comes to leveraged shorting timing is everything  its easy to tell if a stock is overvalued but the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent",fear is a greater motivator than greed so in general all stocks fall faster than they rise no surprise its no different for oversoldoverbought stocks,you take the stairs up and the elevator down

i created a spreadsheet to track  analyze stocks

edit i fixed a couple of things in the spreadsheet make yourself a fresh copy



it consists of two sheets

 tracker a way to track various stocks and automatically pull financial ratios and data
 fundamental analysis pulling financial statement data ratios and key metrics for individual tickers for analysis

everything is automated the only things you have to change are the tickers and data points you want to pull

how to

 open it go to file and click make a copy
 follow the instructions on the guide tab

use the sheet in this way

 add new tickers to column a of staticdata
 sort column a of staticdata by Allianz Aktiengesellschaft (AZ) after adding new tickers
 add the ticker you want to analyze to a of fundamentalanalysis

if  you end up ever adding new rows to tracker or staticdata youll need to  make sure the formulas are applied to each column do this like you  would in excel drag the cells down

its flattening and inverting this is signaling a recession this was what was going on with the bond markets the other day what this means is the fedbigmoney is pulling out thats why were seeing a correction moving money into oil most likely or other actual assets the natural yield curve has probably been inverted for a while but the short end of the curve has been artificially suppressed by the fed were just starting to see it now that they are tapering

doesnt mean freak out just yet or anything but definitely think about being a bit more guarded if you are bullish i would watch all of the banks to see what happens with them definitely the european banks aswell if things get really bad you could see a domino effect



personally i am growing bearish over all of this and just want to get it all over with i will be looking at spyqqq puts tomorrow if we go up in the morning like we did today for that fake out i will grab some at roughly the  cent range usually the callsputs within a  dollar range work for this since that is the AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR) spy puts out its hard to tell today without knowing how tomorrow will be but usually the ones worth that much at the top end up flying  DTE Energy Company (DTE) i am going to try to wait till we have a  Banco Santander Central Hispano, S.A. (STD) dev move upwarddownward before i grab them dont know if the morning fake out will get us that high but also this play can be reversed if for some reason we start moving upwards set stop losses move them up right off the rip when you are in the green dont get greedy do this and you will make a profit even if you get stopped out if you get stopped out wait and rebuy another option

this play is also separate in relation to the above mentioned stuff i am buying options regardless of what happens

this is an extremely risky play and i do not recommend you jump into this if you are not familiar with how DTE Energy Company (DTE) options work

i am only going to throw a few hundred at this and see what happens its been working out great all week so far though be aware tomorrow is option expiration for leaps that were bought  years ago

today we closed at an important ma line on most major stocks a critical one some even below tomorrow is opex playing options could be very risky tomorrow with everything

this isnt a yield curve inversion we measure the curve as gaps between short dated and long dated yield such as the ss ss ss its when those measures invert its a bearish signal 

it is also wise to note the varying liquidity at different parts of the curve and the investors which participate in each maturity segment ie yields in the y may simply be stale  dormant due to low trading volume given it is mainly insurance companies in this part hedging liabilities not the average active fund","i can see how its concerning but a much stronger indicator of a recession is when shortterm yields rise above longterm yields that indicates that the fed has increased rates too high andor investors are fleeing to treasuries for safety

the  year yield rose over the  at the very end of october shortly before the fed announced that it would start to taper qe in november qe distorts the treasury market by holding down yields so tapering  investors expectations of falling bond prices may be part of the cause for the rate inversion","yr is new and an anomaly its been inverted for  like four months a legitimate spread to watch would be the yr  yr spread since it is currently the flattest on the curve

year,options,Losing for 5 years straight,"started off in  trading penny stocks to get my feet in the water and then robinhood released options a few months later and i went right in the first two years of trading options i probably blew atleast  small accounts ranging from kk i had no clue what i was doing back then i was mostly gambling and wasnt taking the time to learn what options really were  i started to educate myself about ta supplydemand and joining alert groups and discords and learning with a community which has really helped i was making gains consistently but when it was time to finally have a losing trade i would just not let myself have a red day and wipe out months of gains in one day i would have  month of straight green trades and when the inevitable losing day comes i just never take the small loss and move onto the next 

i also never really used hard stop losses and relied on a mental stop which  of the time i would keep moving the stop loss down and average down on the losing trade there were multiple times where i averaged down heavy on a horribly losing trade and it turns out to be a huge win later on which is a a horrible habit iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) required i feel like i lack consistency discipline and emotional control both in trading and in real life i lack consistency in real life with simple things like taking a multivitamin daily going to the gym or keeping my room clean or something i lack discipline also such as cleaning my room sparingly or going to work late sometimes not completing things before a deadline etc i know with trading you have to be pinpoint perfect with following rules and i was always a rule breaker in many aspects of life 

im not sure why after  years of trading i just havent given up yet atleast i have super strong sense of motivation i love trading looking at charts at night and reading trading related news i just need to fix these simple yet gigantic issues that are stopping me from becoming a successful trader just last month i had my biggest day gain of k and i slowly gave it all back within a week why because after that huge gain the next trades were small wins such as  gains and that didnt please me anymore apparently

when i first started selling puts one of the stocks was macys m macys was a relatively inexpensive stock at the time was trading at around  but the premiums matched aapls put premiums 

one day i was assigned shares which i thought was no big deal  instead of just selling back the shares for a loss i talked myself into holding on to them  after all this was a great company right

a year and a half later and my shares were still at a  loss  because of the drop covered calls were out of the question as i would consistently have to monitor to ensure i wasnt assigned for a loss

i eventually just ripped the bandaid off and sold my shares at a loss  i used the loss as both a learning experience and tax write off  as a matter of fact five years later and macys stock is still well below where i was assigned and even lower than where i sold my shares at

now i never sell a put on a stock or etf i dont want to own  and i always have insurance just in case im assigned and the stock or etf drops like a rock 

if you want to generate similar income per month without the fear of assignment look at trading credit spreads  they have protection built into them  so if you are assigned you will have another option contract that allows you to get out of them for minimal loss

if you are in the us and you want to save on the capital gains youre taxed on your options trading account look at spx  they are cash settled and you cant be assigned early  plus your gains are taxed at a  split  meaning that  of your gains are taxed at long term capital gains and  at short term  all other profits from options trading are taxed at short term capital gains which is essentially your income tax bracket",better than a  loss keep plugging along friend

if youre like the rest of us and have no clue when the crash will happen youll end up paying insurance premiums at some interval its pretty much like car or house insurance you dont know when or if your car or house will be totaled but you pay for insurance every year anyway its the same with buying long puts against a future crash you could throw a lot of insurance premium down a hole without any guarantee of getting any of that money back and for the most part you hope that you dont get any money back right

strategy,options,Does anyone use weighted averages to determine the viability of a trading strategy?,"this logically makes sense to me but i dont see or hear it discussed much 
from what i have found so far most ics have negative weighted averages but vertical spreads have positive ones

lets look at a short vertical spread on spy nov for simplicitys sake im going to assume only max profit and max loss and ignore the small probability that it ends up between the strikes

 youre considering your exposure in a discrete space and a really low dimensional space at that ideally youd do this in a continuous fashion across all possible outcomes 
 the probability of profit youre getting from your broker is based on a flawed gaussian assumption its useful to an extent for reasoning about trades but does not reflect reality if volatility interest rates etc stayed static then it would be closer to reality but they dont and it isnt

as for the iron condors the detail your discrete weighted average is missing is that the values closer to the center between the two short strikes are the most probable values and probability of outcomes decrease as you move further away from those in either direction",yes i have definitely considered this but i am far from an expert laugh out loud,expected value is used by many
strategy,options,covered call strategy clarification,"all

for some odd reasons i cant seem to understand clearly about the Protective Life Corporation (PL) diagram of covered call strategy i always thought that covered call strategy is for bearish because the goal is to collect the premium and you keep the stock this means that you want the current stock price is below the strike price so that you can keep the premium and run while keeping underlying stock income generation however it says this strategy is for bullish strategy and i cant seem to make an understanding of the Protective Life Corporation (PL) diagram clearly maybe i am thinking strangely about this whole concept can someone point me what part i am not understanding clearly i feel like i understand when to deploy this strategy under what conditions but this Protective Life Corporation (PL) diagram always confuses me in some weird way if someone can break it down to easy to understand the diagram then much appreciated",1,"covered calls are preferred when you are mildly bullish  expecting some upside but not a huge rally the premium adds income but limits your profit if the stock really rallies in a very bearish case you would not want to cap your profit at the strike price and in a very bullish case you miss out on large gains above the strike   

if stock price really goes south you will not get any premium if you sell too otm and there is a risk of your stock getting called away if you sell closer to the money  thats why its suited if you are mildly bullish but not overaly bullish",i use weekly ccs to generate income my goal is  a week but i rarely sell one with less than a  profit of course that should only be done on strong but less volatile stocks example i bought  shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) at  in mar and sold the s for  the stock went up over  at expiration so it cost me  a share but fortunately i was able to roll them up to  at a  cost and iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) had to do it several more times but NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been a beast and even though iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) made more than  in less than  Mosaic Company (The) (MOS) i wouldve made  just buy and hold the option premiums are so high though it has helped a few times like before earnings it went from ish to  and then right after earnings when it peaked out at  and then promptly dropped to ish each huge down draft iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) bought back the options and sold ones further out and have profited but on all the rest of my portfolio iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been generating income to live on from selling ccs dividends just arent enough for me to live on but the  to  a week is working out well so far,"im not sure what diagram you are referring to or your source  your thinking is generally on track  i own a bunch of Apple Computer, Inc.

i am still learning so feel free to hit me up for any tips or anything i have done wrong way or any questions i have learned a lot from everyone here laugh out loud thank yall

edit for people asking me why i chose htz and spc calls is because htz had been given bankruptcy protection which means they have been given more time to deal with the lenders and creditors while they have been given this time anything could happen ie someone could buy them out or maybe restrictions were lifted along with the market moving up and up htz resisting  mark and decided that it will not go down most likely on top on friday market moved up  pts which basically dragged every stock on the exchange up making me close my trade in green whereas Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG) calls i bought because they were trading at lowest and then trump announced that cities will be partially opened including malls will be opened soon if you know about Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG) they are the largest shopping mall operator in the us and own majority of the mall buildings around the country lockdown being lifted means malls and places opening which led me to the assumption that they will be back in the business sooner or later which turned out true for me again i could be wrong according to you but thats my  cents

i was slapped with the hand of reality yesterday after a fight with my girlfriend shes felt that since iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) started trading which was a little over a year and a half ago iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) become less patient  irritable ultimately being the reason why our relationship has been falling apart 

im the type of person that when i get really into something i try to be the very best at whatever it is thus this is the mindset that i took when learning the ins and outs of trading options 
like most i started out on robinhood and as i felt more comfortable i opened an account with Toronto Dominion Bank (The) (TD) ameritrade i started with around a thousand dollars which coming for me is a kind of a stretch for me at the time

fast forward i became absorbed by the markets  trading on the weekends i researched and planned plays for the week  i couldnt wait for monday to get back in there and trade i love trading it excites me its fun it makes me feel like im doing something with my life however the emotions that came with it seemed to take a toll on me  my relationship the losses would  impact the mood for the rest of my day i would just be really upset at myself for  not being smarter she would constantly support me day in and day out not financially but emotionally 
i would take time off to get my head straight and then give it another go

nonetheless history repeats itself  nothing changed id still get upset with myself over the losses  would start to sell some of my personals to make enough to keep trading i know ill probably get shit for having a gambling addiction i just would have the mindset of not quitting and not giving up not wanting to become a failure 

all said  done she finally told me that giving up trading all together was just not for me  i just feel useless aside from working my shity job i dont have anything that i can put my mind and energy into that makes me feel productive and good like im working towards something

if your broker supports setting stops and limits on the underlying price you are good to go

except that you shouldnt go dont trigger on the underlying in the first place if your calls value goes up when the stock prices goes down you wouldnt want to stop out on the stock price also your call price can go down when the stock goes up aka iv crush so you dont want to exit then either

also dont use stops options can lose more than whatever your stop price is and then recover that amount and more the next day so stops can act as profit prevention as much as loss prevention just use alerting and monitor your positions daily for the loss side of the equation you can set a limit order to close gtc for the profit side","im not saying its a good idea but to answer the question yes if the broker supports contingent orders with multiple or conditions then the condition is set to be the underlying last price being below  or exceeding  to trigger a market sell to close order on the call

im trying it in fidelitys condition trade screen and it will let me place that kind of order you have to put in the option as the option symbol though such as jepic

of course the underlying last price might hit those during extended hours but the option can be sold only during regular hours except for those that trade  minutes after close such as spy

now of course i would do a market sell to close only if the options typically have a tight bidask spread such as Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) or spy if the bidask spread is wide or theres low liquidity doing a market order is just asking to get a bad fill

any help in understanding this would be appreciated 

thanks in advance",2,"you have to understand the different components of an options price 

in this case the rise in the price is due to an increase in implied volatility iv essentially investors expect more volatility so the price of the options goes up in this cas the change in iv was so big that it outweighed the drop in price in the underlying

you should take a look at delta change of price of the option for a  move in the underlying and vega change of pride of the option for a point move in iv

effects of implied volatility happen after earnings for example after earnings there usually is a large drop in iv lets imagine a company reported earnings but the price didnt move you would see puts and calls get hammered because of the decrease in iv even if the stock price didnt move that much","thats why after a huge dump it is better to wait for the next day to buy leaps calls even tho vega is small with  year leaps it is still a good discount

overview i have noticed how some particular stocks stocks over  a share can sometimes move wildly on earnings reports good or bad i first learned and notcied this on lululemons earnings lulu dramatically moved when they posted their earnings not to long ago you could have gotten one call for  and a put for  the next day the call cashed for k and obviously the put worthless i then used this strategy of buying an at the moment call and at the moment put when costco had their recent earnings i got burned on that play due to the underlying not moving dramatically overnight after that loss i learned to apply this strategy to stocks in their  and are historically known for large price movement to offset the theta burn the next day and change of iv 

my current strategy netflix Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) earnings are  ah and the underlying falls into my two categories high price of stock and historically known to move overall im bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) for earnings they are anticipated to have a strong q with high subscriber growth especially in asia and europe the stock may explode as well if they make a major gaming update however in my strategy i will buy  at the moment put and  at the moment call  minutes prior to market close on  since im bullish as well i would also buy x otm  lottos all expiring the same week 

is the only way i loose if the stock stays the same  if there is no volatility and no change in stock price if the stock tanks my at the moment put would print because of the delta and how many dollars its down and the potential increase in iv even after there is no more uncertainty due to the underlying tanked hard and fast the iv could certainly increase and not crush that out would save my worthless call and my worthless otm calls and break even and may profit then if netflix moons for earnings like it did in january im stupid rich right lmk what im missing thank you",3,removed,buying straddles and strangles is really the worst way to play er unless you notice the implied move is oddly low statistically if you sold straddles and strangles youd have a much higher win rate,"most of the time straddle buyers lose in most large studies straddle buyers lose about  percent of the time

the very few data points you noted are not statistically significant 

what i tend to observe is cycles a few big names have big moves premiums get bid up next cycle is mostly small moves so straddle sellers become more aggressive

earnings tend to be a crapshoot slight edge to straddle sellers however some of losers can be astronomical on the other side it is those very few huge moves that keeps the straddle buyers interested"

note that formula is a good approximation when the price change is small and the time period is quick so there is no theta decay  in case youre wondering delta and gamma are the first and second derivatives of the option price with respect to the underlying so you are in effect just using the definition of delta and gamma and a taylor expansion from calculus",youd have to look up the black scholes option price formula you need interest rate implied volatility dividends if any underlying price time to expiry and so on even then expected future events like earnings announcements can cause an unpredictable asymmetry in the putcall spreads that get attributed to differing degrees of implied volatility

the difference between winning and losing a scalp can come down to a split second so even if someone were sitting next to me and trying to mimic my every move they might have had losses theres also a certain blind aspect to it i was buying a call contract using a limit order always below the bid price never the midpoint and selling at the market price because the trades generally happened too quickly to even think about using a sell limit order this only makes sense to do in a highly liquid stock with lots of options volume

during one of the days the underlying stock was in a downtrend i made money by using rsi and macd using a very short holding time and relying on microbursts of momentum

in general my success was made possible by the fact that the stock i chose was trading in a very very very narrow range during the very brief intervals in which i held it and it seemed to oscillate above and below the mean price in that interval like a sine wave thus i could use the macd as a pretty reliable signal for buying and selling

psychologically this took a lot of energy and focus monday trading lasted one hour and eight minutes tuesday lasted one hour eleven minutes and thirtyseven seconds wednesday lasted nineteen minutes and twentythree seconds on monday and tuesday i just couldnt handle any more trading even though i won every trade on wednesday a day that i hadnt wanted to trade but snuck in those two trades i didnt want to push my luck i did it to top things off i really hate options scalping as a strategy because its so intense but if you need cash right this minute its probably your best bet my favorite strategy on the other hand is shorting put options with an expiration date several months out

i strongly advise against trying something like this on a thursday and you absolutely cant do it on a friday due to theta decay and gamma and vega or youll lose your shirt although iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) never held a scalp overnight iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) considered the possibility of buying on a monday and waiting possibly three more days if thats what it took for a substantial gain in this way with a bunch of days to rely upon you might give yourself multiple opportunities to win should one day not prove favorable i prefer an intraday scalp though because you never know what could happen in afterhours trading

i honestly dont know if winning all sixteen of the trades consecutively was almost entirely dumb luck or hardly any latent skill but it seems unlikely from a statistical perspective that it was entirely dumb luck i dont plan on trying this again anytime soon either way i like to design winning options plays very carefully and take lots of time executing them for slow easy wins so it was interesting to try to emulate the scalpers everything considered im just grateful for the unexpected success using a style that isnt natively mine

what are others experiences with scalping do you have any tips

artem",268,what underlying and how many contracts,you certainly can do scalps on thursdays and fridays most people scalping spy are using the closest expiration date but the length that you held some of these would be too long you want to ride momentum and get out before it slows down theres many times where i am in calls for less than a minute and then taking puts as im closing those calls and then closing those in less than a minute as well scalping the open on spy you have to be very fast which means taking profits fast and closing losers even faster,never tried doing this but you sure made it look attractive congrats mate
time,options,"The median time from diagnosis to intubation with COVID19 is 11 days from onset of symptoms. Treat Oct 10-12 as you would treat earnings days, CLOSE YOUR POSITION.","edit symptoms vs no symptoms that is the question 

he is tested all the time now one if them is positive 

it is important to note this almost all of the data we have on outcomes of patients with covid are from cohorts with symptoms no symptoms no good data


edit bonus trade when shit hit the fan what did the presidents team do they gave him regncov from regeneron regn   pm cst  its an experimental drug not fda cleared that sounds like basically an antibody infusion similar to receiving plasma infusions from previously infected donors

if i had to guess id say the drug delivers more consistent and measurable doses of antibodies than if transfused with plasma which would be a more inconsistent dosage per dose 

heres the upside

the president will most likely recover with or without the drug and it will not be clear if it helped at all to me that hedges against sell off in the event of his demise 



trumps risk for poor outcome with covid is relatively high given his age obesity sex and medical problems not previously disclosed 

the median time from onset of covid symptoms to the time the person is intubated is  days 

if trump is admitted to the hospital he is likely very ill he will likely otherwise receive care within the white house unless his condition worsens

however there will be a low threshold to admit him to the hospital because he is the president and he will be put in intensive care regardless because he will receive  care

all patients  have  risk of death

if he is placed on ventilation noninvasive bipap or invasive intubation his risk of death is  for all patients  equal men vs women screwed higher for obesity male heart disease

if he receives invasive or noninvasive ventilation he has  risk for dialysis and if placed on dialysis risk of death is 

median length of ventilation for all ages is  days

final consideration it isnt death that is the deciding factor it is the question can he fulfill his duty as president 

ride your position until oct  then take your profits


edit key point here admission to the hospital not his check up at walter reed at current is the trigger also we dont know if he is symptomatic or simply has a positive test yes i am aware he will be there a few days but he is receiving an experimental drug that has not cleared the fda and will require monitoring for adverse reactions it appears that he basically needs a controlled setting for the drug not so much an admission for covid  i dont buy that he would be there if not for the drug he would be at home",430,i assume hes getting much better care than the other patients  patients those stats are pulled from wsj reported they gave him a regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail is that even available to the general public let alone affordable to the general public,in his case the chances of this getting very severe are about  the market barely flinched,he also is low income you have to add that to the age and weight factors

time,options,"AMC: An imploding time bomb, and put spreads to capitalize","hi everyone

for everyone considering an investment in gmes little sister  wanted to open the floor to a few facts and why amc is not Gamestop Corporation (GME) and how big finance has already dumped on retail investors and are about to celebrate big plays for round 

factstodate

 in the midst of this mania silver lake  mudrick capital two scummy vulture investment firms have already quietly extracted almost  billion dollars from retail investors see  and  these guys are celebrating the best play theyve ever made on their yachts in the hamptons right now to put the size of this into perspective the value of every single amc share combined was m two weeks ago
 many here have said well i dont care amc share price is only  above precovid times have it completely wrong and are forgetting how many shares amc have been issued  there are currently x as many outstanding shares and the current market cap is  of what it was precovid see  adding to the pain the moves above added even more shares to dilute the value though elimination of debt does have some positive Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) offset
 unlike Gamestop Corporation (GME) there arent the same conditions for a widespread short squeeze short interest between  depending on how you  it multiple funds involved and plenty of days and liquidity to cover

the kicker there are big incentives to keep prices elevated in the short term amc has already stated theyre in the midst of considering whether to  which would be the mother of short squeeze killers

the insider conundrum what might seem bizarre and bullish is that based on the sec filings to date the largest insiders have not exited their positions yet unlike insiders at koss who were happy to unload their entire portfolio unfortunately altruism and optimism are almost certainly not the explanation as share prices are still far above what they wouldve rationally expected for years to come these insiders are bound by both sec laws and their fiduciary duty  they cant say no to raising more capital if its in the best interest of the company but the sec wont allow them dump their shares if theyre on the verge of diluting them theyre mulling over the capital raise carefully because doing so would also reduce the value of their stake unless they can put the cash to work in a value accretive way theyre left with two options

 issue more shares and see if they can effectively take advantage of the cash in a way that overcomes dilution eg buyback content plays
 keep the prices inflated and wait until enough time has passed for their lawyers to clear them and dump on retail

the imploding landmine both of these moves would kill both the value of the shares and the potential for a short squeeze simultaneously and ensure share prices go back to normalized values at  depending on the level of optimism for amcs future

the play puts on amc were prohibitively expensive due to iv since last week but iv has been creeping down drastically as the price flattens if amc prices remain stable through monday  put spreads post earnings should be the way to go conservative with buying a p and selling a p

too long; didn't read amc is disguised as a a cheaper version of Gamestop Corporation (GME) but its a pump and dump scheme where the winners arent who you think they are

edit getting a lot of pms to be clear this isnt an endorsement foragainst Gamestop Corporation (GME) but one of these two companies has issued more shares during the mania and has told you theyre debating whether to do it again and that creates a more interesting investment thesis than betting on reddit psychology for the next month it also doesnt depend on others joining the cause or holding the line not a financial adviser and will be putting my money where my mouth is

edit  updated positions",1182,you are right macrotrends doesnt cover this but is it fair to assume that retail dont look at market cap and only shareprice,looking through your post history how do you go from not knowing how a credit spread works to a short write up on amc in a month,yeah dont understand what they were thinking with the amc hype

time,options,Did Hedge Funds Manipulate Small Time investors (Reddit/Retail) in Gamestop/Silver Option plays?,"the established wisdom on the recent short squeezes is that a bunch of happy options traders led by reddit and social media us in other words  created a retail swarm and hit the hedge funds and made a ton of money whilst at the same time sticking up to wall street

today carson block who always published his shorts instead of keeping quiet about them but is now deleveraging as a result of recent price action suggests that underlying the recent incredible stock and options actions weve all witnessed retail investors were actual  setup from opposing hedge funds calls versus puts using the so called retail swarms as a cover for their premeditated price action on the same options many of us bought and so half of wall street actually got rich on this as a result hes not names the funds yet and it will be hard top prove but we may just be incidental foot soldiers in a larger mob hedge fund game

chart different cycles affect stock market movements

so are us stocks done falling yet 

bruce has many predictions for the future as he mentioned earlier according to current market estimates the most common forecast is for the us to raise interest rates four times in  but bruce strongly believes that there may be more than four times and that the pace of tapering will exceed expectations will interest rate hikes alone bring down the stock and property markets we cant rule out the possibility that something like the first oil crisis will suddenly happen and push up inflation in the us forcing the fed to raise interest rates faster than everyone expects

according to the ministry of economic development trade and agriculture ukraine is the worlds second largest exporter of barley fourth largest exporter of corn and fifth largest exporter of wheat in the  market year if the crisis does worsen will energy and food prices rise sharply and how will the federal reserve react as siulung said if the us fed misjudges inflation will the us raise interest rates as it did in the s

i trade exclusively in iron condors because i like that theyre

although im diversified across underlyings if a market crash were to occur i imagine most if not all of my ics would blow past the short put spread leg of each ic and id be left with half of what i started with

given this what are some good longterm strategies to hedge a market crash  do you add far otm debit put spreads in the same underlying  do you long volatility via vxx or long an inverse index like sh for spy  whats the prevailing wisdom here

bonus thoughtquestion im also wondering if i should start diversifying my strategies to not only be ics  what would you recommend for nonic strategies that are defined risk and delta neutral

thanks",377,"you want to have your cake and eat it you cant be delta neutral collect premium and hedge against a crash either you lose market neutrality or lose some of your premium

the simplest thing to do is to take on less risk with your ics and eventually diversify with large cap defensive stocks",what about actual shares of a stock with a negative beta,"i do a couple of things to hedge

the first one is to try to take the opposite view within the same trade so its more neutral iron condors are okay but i like the jade lizard for this 

the second is to try to take the opposite view overall within the portfolio since i mostly trade spy and spy and qqq are pretty correlated i do some pmccs in sqqq which goes up when qqq goes down a pmcc allows me to bleed a little most of the time but then when qqq goes down sharply i gain in the pmcc so my account stays relatively flat

i was checking out the volume and price of spy  puts for next year for example and i noticed  things   


 there is little to no volume on near anything after january

stock market crash,options,[Gann Theory]There be any cycle in the stock market? US market crash every 7 years?,"absolutely the answer is yes but we cant apply a simple and fixed model to all stock markets each stock market is an independent viberation with its own cycle and development laws therefore the cycle and law of the stock market will be introduced before presenting the text of this book

since the s economists in western countries have engaged in the study the law of the cycle and all believed that there was a longterm law in the economic growth or recession there is noting new thing under the sun

in  the american economist s kuznets proposed a business cycle applying to housing construction with an average length of  years this longterm cycle is known as the kuznets cycle or building cycle c juglar a french economist published his business crisis and cycle in france britain and the united states in  in this book he pointed out that the capitalist economy fluctuated every nine to ten years as generally called juglar cycle joseph schumpeter took this as the mediumterm cycle or the juglar cycle

edward r deway known as the father of cycle analysis believed that the most statistically reliable cycles were  years and  years he was also the founder of many institutions studying the cycles edward r dewey  dedicated his life to study the cycles not limited to the business cycle and in  he was appointed as the chief economic analyst by the us department of commerce trying to find the cause of the great depression in  and  in the united states edward r dewey established the foundation for the study of cycles in pittsburgh in  the following are some graphs about the cycles proposed by edward

business cycles can be categorized into longterm mediumterm and shortterm ones you may ask is there any business cycle in the stock market or the economy lets begin with the stock market cycle and then we will talk about the real estate cycle

the year cycle is one of the cores of ganns cycle theory when making a prediction the year cycle can be divided in further including the following different cycles

if this year cycle is applied to calculate the stock market cycle you will get an amazing discovery  for example hong kongs stock market crash in  followed with another one  years later namely in  because of the upsurge of red chip speculation by foreign investors in  and the united states increase of the interest rates for  successive times  years later around the year of  and  the stock market underwent a huge decline because of the outbreak of avian influenza in  namely  years after that hsi hit the bottom as a consequence of the financial tsunami when it came to  exactly  years later hsi witnessed a depreciation in  after experiencing the bull market

when the year cycle is applied to shanghai securities composite index there will also come something incredible as shown in the chart below the first peak after the establishment of shanghai stock exchange occurred in may  following ganns year cycle another peak appeared in the half of  exactly  years later  years later the year of  witnessed the climax of the bull market after  years the year of  marked the starting point of the bull market in  it is thought that the year of   years later will be another high or low point

just as the old chinese sayings go that both people and things undergo great changes in a decade gold may become worthless in a decade and we cannot predict what will happen in a decade and dont laugh at poor people wearing rags these sayings point out the essence of the year cycle juglar proposed that there was a  to  years cyclical fluctuation for the market economy in his book business crisis and cycle in france britain and the united states in  in business prophecies of the future United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) and downs in prices samuel t benner stated that the highest point of trade price followed a repeated year pattern the year cycle also plays an important role in gann theory

the above chart shows that the shanghai securities composite index also subjects itself to a week cycle in the weekly column chart of the shanghai securities composite index the time interval between the peak in october  and the low point is  weeks after that there will be return in every  weeks either the peak or the bottoming out of the market index

lets see the weekly column chart of the shanghai securities composite index and take  weeks as a cycle it is found that from the high point of  there is a relative turn in a cycle of  weeks or its multiples namely         and 

is this a coincidence or an accident for the above change in the stock market

now one question whether the movement in the stock market is driven by events or the high and low points at the previous time point cycle therefore chinas stock market proceeds in a cyclical way the turning point can be predicted as long as the right starting point can be realized

there is also a cycle for real estate although economists all over the world hold different opinions towards the research of the real estate market but they serve the same effect i will state the opinions of the following economists for your reference

michael hoyt the author of one hundred years of land values in chicago studied the price of real estate in chicago in a time period of  years since there were only dozens of wooden houses and he found that its price cycles about every  years

edward r deway known as the father of cycle analysis believed that each real estate cycle lasts for about  years

fred harrison a british economist studying the real estate market in the britain and united states in the past plus years found that the housing price cycled about every  years

simon smith kuznets believed that the building cycle is  to  years

it is coincidentally acknowledged that the real estate market cycles every  to  years starting from  it is generally believed that the real estate market in hong kong has gone through three major cycles the first cycle from  to  the second one from  to  and the third one from  to now the housing price often goes up or down along with the change of both internal and external elements

i have mentioned the hong kong real estate market cycle in different situations it is not difficult to draw a conclusion from the cycle of hong kongs real estate market that the cycle works every Swiss Exchange (SIX) years since  great changes occur every Swiss Exchange (SIX) years including    and  with ganns  segmentation method we can get that three years constitute a secondary cycle namely in    and 

the change of the real estate market can also be concluded with the year cycle which has worked since  undoubtedly the real estate market in hong kong goes up after experiencing the lowest point in  predicably that the year of  is likely to witness the completion of an year cycle stepping back again the rise of the real estate market in  can be explained with the year cycle mentioned above since the signing of the sinobritish joint declaration in 

it is likely that the upsurge of hong kongs real estate market will end in  and then we should turn to the turning point that may appear from  to 

the economic cycle of us stocks has a very obvious year cycle

in  the united states experienced a credit crunch in august of the same year the us treasury market suffered a severe liquidity crisis

in  seven years later the world suffered the first oil crisis with stock market and economic problems and the first stagflation

seven years later in  wall street forced the hunt brothers to stop hoarding silver  which helped some banks and securities firms to avoid bankruptcy

in october  the dow fell  in one day on black monday

seven years later in  the fed raised interest rates Swiss Exchange (SIX) times in a row and interest rates rose sharply from  to  resulting in the most famous bond massacre in history

seven years later in  the black swan event of  triggered a severe setback in the global stock market and the us declared an emergency stock market closure from  to  but the market resumed on the th the us stocks still had a panic sale the sp  index opened at  points and closed almost at the low of  points down  while the dow jones industrial index was killed to  points down  and the stock market fell  in one week

the year cycle came to  the financial tsunami hong kong stocks and us stocks plunged

in  hong kong stocks and us stocks crash



i would predict that in  there may be a significant pullback in us stocks",0,too long; didn't read this year we crash,"the economic cycle of us stocks has a very obvious year cycle

lots of confirmation bias here shoehorning things into this year cycle yes most years something bad happens in stocks at some point you seem to suggest that the  terrorist attack was predicted by this year cycle do you think the hijackers wanted to do it in  but held off until  so it would fit this timeline

if were looking at exogenous events how does the worst day period for the sp since the great depression fit into this narrative no mention of covid crash of march  

why are you bringing the hunt brothers silver squeeze into this i thought we were talking about stocks couldnt find anything else that happened in  because the sp  was up  in   ill take that

my new theory is that now all even years have significant pullbacks so buy puts in even years    
 covid crash    
     
  worldwide stock market day in history due to brexit    
 september  of  in  days

were now on a year cycle prove me wrong",ye best start believing in business cycle driven downturns youre in one
stock market crash,options,I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,"we have all heard it  time in the market beats timing the market

at the same time we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market the market always seems to break some new alltime high records so we wait for the inevitable crashpullback to invest its high time we put both strategies to test basically what i wanted to analyze was

whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested

analysis

for this lets take someone who started investing approximately  decades back  to be exact i created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest   

for analysis simplicity lets assume that you were on a conservative side never picked individual stocks and always made your investments to sp  for investment amount consider that you started with investing k in  and increased your investments by  for every subsequent year so you made a total investment of k over the last  years  

results



the analysis did throw up some interesting results theres a lot to unpack here and lets break it down by each segment

the most important insight is that its virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market  even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year you will still end up having a  return on your invested amount

at the opposite end of the spectrum if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year you would have made a cool  more than someone who invested only at the top given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases lets consider some more realistic scenarios      

if you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each monthyear you would still make a shade over  on your investments

out of all the above scenarios you would have made the most amount of money a whopping  return if you invested only during major crashes in this type of investing you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash

while this seems like a good idea in theory its extremely difficult to execute properly in real life the main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a the current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes its very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening you can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up it can end up wiping out your portfolio

b identifying a crash itself is very hard



as we can see from the above chart the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year so even when the market is down  it becomes extremely difficult to know whether its going into a deeper crash or whether its going to bounce back up

conclusion

while the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returnswise practically its very difficult to execute it

for eg even if you predicted the  coronavirus crash correctly where would be your entry point the market was down  by mar th another  by mar th and then another  by march th for a total of  if you did not get in at the absolute bottom you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous runup   

it is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns adding to this in the last  years  of the best days in the market happened within  days of the worst ones  if you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested

if you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom you will make an absolute killing in the market for the rest of us continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice

investing really is simple if you just want solid gains  so much more difficult when you try to beat the market"
options,options,The Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitability (The reasons selling option premium makes or loses money),"heres what makes option selling profitable in detail and how to increase your returns selling them

this is a long post it helps you understand options a bit better and make some profitable decisions in the future

i try to make theta and options easier to understand by relating it to real estate and moving one step at a time

if you have questions leave a comment ill try to respond to everyone

lets dive into the world of theta and options trading

  theta is a feature of an option plain and simple

imagine showing someone a house and saying to them its  bedrooms  washrooms good neighbourhood and the rent is mo

each thing you listed in that sentence is a feature of the house you wouldnt say that the house is good or bad because bedroom or because rent etc its the over all view with all things considered

similarly theta gamma vega delta etc these are just features of an option inherently they are not good or bad they just tell you about the option you are looking at

  think of theta as rent

if options were a house theta would be the rent think about it like this someone pays rent to get access to the house

in the options space someone pays theta for access to other features of the option

can you guess what they are paying for access to

  one mans theta is another mans gamma

if you guessed gamma you are correct traders pay theta to get access to gamma

the easy way to think about gamma is that its your sensitivity to big moves if a stock moves like crazy the option buyer makes some bank right so why on earth would anyone sell options

  the amount of theta is directly correlated with the gamma risk

going back to our house example if you wanted to buy a big penthouse in downtown new york the rent is probably pretty high its because you get access to some awesome shit if you pay it it wouldnt make sense for the rent to be mo no one would rent it out the rent is correlated with the house you get exposure to

in the options space if a stock has a lot of gamma risk aka the risk of big move the theta on the option is higher too this is because if it were not proportionately higher no one would be a seller and there would be no market

now heres the key if gamma and theta were perfectly even and markets were totally efficient the expected value would be  you wouldnt make money being a buyer or seller in this world who wouldnt want break even exposure to big moves its basically a free hedge

so theres this little thing called variance risk premium

  option sellers get a small premium for being on the short side of convexity

the variance risk premium is a small edge for the option seller that they get for holding the risk of big moves

because of this on average selling options is profitable in the long run you will have a lot of small winners and the occasional big loser this is what we call a short vol strategy

you can see the risk premium on a lot of stocks an easy way to see it is to plot the implied volatility for  day options over the realized volatility for  day period you should see that on average the implied move what the options say will happen is a bit higher than what actually does this is the premium

and then you will see periods where the big gamma move happens and the rv goes higher than the iv this is why the premium exists

example



xb

green line  iv blue line  rv this is on spy you can see how most of the time iv  rv sometimes the rv shoots up though that is the risk we take when selling why we get paid a premium

but heres the thing how much can we really expect to make here

in the long run about  per year boo

i want more you want more fuck   year so how do we do it

  buy cheap things sell expensive things

lets go back to our house example  more time imagine we are evaluating a property in new york city all of a sudden a huge amount of demand comes into the market there is a shortage of houses for all the renters so the rent keeps increasing you look at your property  beds nice view fair rent is probably  mo but you look at the market and people are offering mo for your property

in this case by renting out your property you are making an inflated premium or a rent premium higher than what you should be making given the asset you are giving someone access to

in options we can find stocks where the theta is higher than it should be given the gamma we give someone exposure to

think about some of these meme stocks as example so many buyers so few sellers who wants that risk right

well this is perhaps opportunity

if we can come into the market and put a fair value on the gamma we can find times where we can be overcompensated with theta

there is a simple formula for understanding this

if implied volatility is higher than what you think realized volatility will be sell

even more simply put if option more expensive than how much stock move sell

the hard part is learning to price volatility  options ill cover the basics in another post if this one does well

  heres an example of how i analyzeprice gamma and theta

imagine we divided the iv by the rv we would be able to see how much higher or lower the iv is compared to the rv

example if ivrv   then the price of the option is x higher than the value the buyer is actually getting easy way to think about it

by plotting the ivrv ratio historically we can see how much of a premium their typically is and how bad it gets when the gamma move is big

example



typically the ivrv ratio for  DTE Energy Company (DTE) options is positive on spy but we do have periods of pain where it goes lower and that erases a lot of gains

 conclusion

theta is not free money its a characteristic of an option understanding it is important but really its our ability to price risk that makes us money as traders the better we get at pricing risk the truly juicier premiums we can find

if this post is well received by the community ill gladly do a follow up

happy trading everyone",1612,"theta is not free money theta is free money  


except when it isnt","i remember when i first started buying options barely broke even even when the great ones x because so many of them expire worthless

decided to take the other side of the trade and sell options now i make quite a bit of consistent gains as income and get assigned here and there

when i get assigned i just sell ccs to generate more income or get it called away

either way its better than just aimlessly buying calls and burning cash at least when i literally burn cash i can keep myself warm",i think you credit theta too much and you forget to speak the role vega is playing in all of this which is a big part of the whole ivrv concept otherwise i fully agree with the underlying ideas
options,options,Evidence pointing to shorts did not cover pretended they did (via options) to break the squeeze (Feedback requested),"i know you guys are probably sick of hearing Gamestop Corporation (GME) related stuff but i really wanted to post this here to get some additional thoughtsfeedback from experienced investors

long post ahead but i encourage you to read the whole thing

too long; didn't read data points strongly point to hedge funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they havent truly covered full version below

theres an insightful piece on  that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly

first way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to coverbuy back shares at progressively lower levels



quoting from tradesmithdaily

plummeting short interest along with a plummeting Gamestop Corporation (GME) share price in other words could indicate that the reddit army is headed for the hills and the longs were selling early giving the shorts a means to cover as the longs got out important to note that if the long holders of Gamestop Corporation (GME) shares did not break ranks and sell en masse it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time because without a critical mass of longside holders selling into the market the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered bought back their short positions



however the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in Gamestop Corporation (GME) didnt really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did demoralizing the retail side and further breaking the squeeze



to now quote verbatim from tradesmithdaily

the way the hedge funds could have done this  made it appear as if they covered their shorts even when they really didnt  involves trickery in the options market

the tactics involved are not a secret in fact the securities and exchange commission sec knows all about such tactics and published a risk alert memo on the topic in august 

the sec memo is titled strengthening practices for preventing and detecting illegal options trading used to reset reg sho closeout obligations you can 

the memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language but heres a quick rundown

 if short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades
 a hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock  meaning they are now short the call options having sold the call options to someone else typically a market maker  and simultaneously buy shares against the call options
 the shares bought against the call options could be synthetic longs  meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock  as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade
 this works because if a market maker buys options from an options writer the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of naked shorting as part of their hedging function this is necessary under the current rules and the current system for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades
 as a result of the above transaction the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls a synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasnt part of the original float the synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts legally initiated by the market maker so the market maker can hedge
 the hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have bought back their short position via buying long shares  except they actually havent the synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market makers hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund

it gets very complicated very fast

but the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like theyve covered their shorts  even if they havent truly covered and cant for lack of available float  by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays market maker naked shorting exceptions and legal practices of synthetic share creation new longs and shorts made from thin air relating to marketmaking

below is a section of the sec memo from page  that gets to the heart of it

trader a may enter a buywrite transaction consisting of selling deepinthemoney calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale by doing so trader a appears to have purchased shares to meet the brokerdealers closeout obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion in practice however the circumstances suggest that trader a has no intention of delivering shares and is instead reestablishing or extending a fail position



in short no pun intended these tricks help hedge funds maintain short positions that legally speaking they werent supposed to have because the shares were never properly located which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of ftidsfailed to deliver shares  and michael burrys now deleted tweet viewable here  about how when he called back shares he lent out brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located

these factors lend credence to the idea that shorts werent really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options in order to cover short positions that they shouldnt have had to begin with because shares were never properly located

separately but potentially related s released updated short numbers last sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from  to  a day later on friday to  on sunday while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated  which many found to be suspicious later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded  short interest percentage but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice

for a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached 



excerpt

the real short  according to ss data is  however their  figure is technically not a lie but extremely misleading i will explain everything

here is what they didsources s head

s head is redefining share float to include shares that dont exist in order to be able to say shorted  of float is lower

it reduces the traditional si  float instead of shares shortedfloat our calc is shares shorted float  shares shorted

so by this definition if a stock is shorted  of existing shares total banana count borrowed and resold x and total shares is  short  is calculated like this shorts   shares   longs whose shares are borrowed  that is the normal way we define short  would say its  shorted ss way says 

knowing this formula we can work back to what s would have said the short  of float was using the normal definition of short  of float short of float means for all existing shares  shorts or ont he other side of the trade longs whose shares were borrowed away to short is  as much as existing shares meaning portion of shares short by the normal definition  of existing bananas borrowed is   

that is ss data is telling them that after friday trading Gamestop Corporation (GME) is still  short



many have pointed out this could be manipulation on ss part its interesting to note that as late as the jan th ihor from s stated most Gamestop Corporation (GME) shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadnt moved much at all  initially on the th he claimed short interest float to be   the next day he claimed short interest to be   of float  days later on sunday s released a report on the calculated short interest to be  oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted but found this  which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time it turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of  which the media then bandied around before and during market open on monday whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor i cannot conclusively say as i dont have the evidence to conclusively make that claim but definitely something to consider along with all other data points

with the possibility of synthetic long shares being used in a fraudulent way if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue i would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment  and call or email gamestop investor relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity

if youd like to read more into the subject here are more solid posts that are related to this subject that i recommend you check out",3065,very insightful and informative this is the kind of calm and rational thinking that we should all pay attention to seeing the new short  on the th will be interesting,"unfortunately the sec is made up of not only a barely scraping by budget but also some former wallstreet players like goldman sachs exec alan cohen hired as senior policy advisor to the sec chairman in  i cant imagine they would hire people without experience in the field they are supposed to regulate its also odd how so many of these sec memos coming to light describe the exact actions and circumstances that have been happening for years which makes me think some or all of them are written from personal experience

much like the jim cramer interview from mid s on the streettv found on youtube they spell out what can be done regardless of legality the only law it seems is how much money does a certain action cost to do

options,options,SIVB options got exercised,"seeking advice here as i was on the wrong end of the trade i sold puts on SVB Financial Group (SIVB) that got exercised yesterdaytoday by Toronto Dominion Bank (The) (TD) ameritrade 

saturday i got the email saying i was exercised i dont have the margin to cover it its considerably larger margin i got called  figures 


my question is has anyone had any experience on this matter im not looking to dodge paying of i could come to an agreement with my broker would be best on a payment plan but do they do such a thing considering this usually rarely happens where a stock halts and i couldnt exit is the reason im upside down with the max lose

no need to say im a fool as i already feel it

edit v so my portfolio was liquidated on monday they cashed everything out i had Swiss Exchange (SIX) figure portfolio in there thats pretty much all my savings i dont have any more money to give


i was reading that people werent getting exercised and so its just total bad luck that all my contracts got exercised my thinking was the float is mil but with the number of contracts that were sold how did they get so much stock it feels like a Gamestop Corporation (GME) where the short side is x greater than the actual float
also thanks to all the kind people that have posted

edit v for all you saying this is fake why would anyone lie about losing money i wish this wasnt real

options,options,Does anyone make consistent profit buying options?,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been doing a lot of research into different options strategies the past few years and one thing iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) taken from it is that the people who make consistent profits are the ones who sell contracts instead of buying them you might get the occasional wsbtype who hits it big on some random meme stock but those gains are usually fleeting so im curious does anyone here make consistent profit or know someone who does by buying contracts

the closest thing i can think of is this youtube channel i used to listen to a while back that made crazy profit buying otm leaps on tech and growth etfs there were a bunch of people following that method but it obviously blew up in their faces last year now the channels rebranded to talking about fundamentals investing",128,"i know a couple people in my personal life who make a living off options but the common theme iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) heard from them is this 

you have to have a really welldefined strategy that you stick to consistently while simultaneously recognizing that strategy may become obsolete and youre going to need to retool  evolve have really strong discipline  risk management and be evenkeeled and not let wins or losses affect your judgmentall while having a balance large enough to both enable you to trade on margin and sustain loss streaks without hampering your ability to trade 

its already hard enough to have one of these traits but having all of them is incredibly difficult iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been told only one in  people who actually seriously invest themselves into day trading are able to make consistent money and even fewer are going to be making that much more than a regular job at which point why take the risk and have no benefits  pension etc

the people i know make like k annually but all of them are really smart experienced and had great guidance on their journey unless thats you i would take great caution","a decent number of people make money buying leaps deep in the money options long dated out  theyre expensive but they tend to have high deltas and because theyre deep itm they tend to stay itm a lot of those people will sell short dated calls against them as well tho its called a poor mans covered call pmcc  but even if you dont sell the calls the leaps themselves will do pretty good if the underlying goes up  

the other thing people do is buy long options or spreads with a directional bias at the money  if youre buying a contract buy it with the strike price at or near the current if youre buying a long vertical spread buy it where the midpoint is at or near the current price  

what you dont want to do is buy otm contracts  the reason theyre cheap is because theyre unlikely to get profitable and then theta decay is really working against you  those are lottery tickets  cheap good payoff but statistically unlikely",iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been hit and miss buying options so i stopped buying selling options though has added nice returns to my portfolio though

im often reminded of myself in my earlier years when i see others enter a position and then look for help when it turns unfavourably against them nothing inherently wrong with doing so hence i felt like i had to mention it and continue to help and guide others who are new

also do consider trying out paper trading accounts before actually putting in your hard earned money i personally use Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (TDS) thinkorswim platform since its interface is best suited for my needs but the idea is the same regardless of platform you can try out the various strategies outlined in this sub or even do some you only live once trades to see what works for you

at the end of the day were all here to make money together dont blindly throw it away

good luck",804,deleted,i appreciate your post  im also a lurker and relative noob to options but even i am horrified by some of the questions i see here  not for the fact or nature of the questions its great that people are asking but for the fact that people whos cluelessness is a danger to themselves are asking for help after diving into this headfirst  anyway  one of the first things i did when i became interested was go through the options basics  course on    its about  hours of your time total and a great primer on the very basics,if youre new i recommend not only having an exit strategy for when you hit your profit goal but knowing the correct adjustment strategy for your trade to minimize losses

easy to get lost in the minutia the core issue is that the shorts were not prevented from trading when retail was this rigs the system in their favor",3079,"we already know this its literally been posted numerous times robinhood was funded by hedge funds and those hedge funds lost tens of billions this week and thats why rh limited or stopped positions on over a dozen stocks because they could not cover the spread

its like a casino that doesnt have enough money to cover winnings if it loses too much money and thats why robinhood will inevitably go belly up before march sad but this is what happens when a platform is basically run by a mafia that lost all their funds 

it was a smoke and mirrors game they offered stocks to the little guys expecting the little guys to lose more often then they won but now that the little guys won and the platforms backers are in the hole robinhood is fucked 

what a wild last few weeks",watching your vid now to me the webull CNOOC Limited (CEO) interview was a perfect explanation basically Domtar Incorporated (DTC) saw shorts not coming up with money made capital requirements too redic to be able to comply with and passed it down the line once hedge funds go under then market makets clearing houses and broker dealers have to come up with the funds to complete the trade states they prevented a market collapse but I don't know retail investors need a damn check for once,"title cramer manipulation

my routine is to wake up at least an hour before the market opens and make coffee  turn on cnbc to see what it going on as well as what the market futures are showing for the open  

open tos and the tda website then look over positions to see if any have moved overnight and might need to be rolled as well as if any are getting close to closing at the  gtc limit order  

once the market opens perform any rolls if needed and if a trade had closed the prior day or will be closing soon ill look over the watchlist to see what stock will be good to possibly trade  this review will be to narrow down those that do not have an er coming up are in a general upwards trend and double check that there has been no recent bad news or change in analysts ratings  

once any rolls or trades have been made and new gtc limit orders plus alerts set ill update my simple spreadsheet as needed which typically takes from  to about  minutes then my wife and i will have coffee as we plan the day which will include what were doing for dinner if we need to go shopping etc  

ill go about my day and like to play golf or do other things and will check my phone app once in a while during the day to respond to an alert if one comes through  towards the end of the market day ill review positions just to see how they look  

on saturday mornings ill review the prior week as well as see if any stocks status has changed or to explore new ones to update the list  ill spend at most a few hours total a week actively trading which is how i prefer it",wake up  mins before open check economic calendar for the next few days for expirations to avoid touch up the trend lines look at positions and see if theres anything to manage mostly trade spy and qqq and tech stonks

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been trading stocks for  years and options for  i have a fulltime job and just do this on the side but iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen and tried a lot of stuff

one of my favorite trading strategies involves selling spx put credit spreads around  delta  otm  days to expiration crazy right yeah sounds like it but bear with me while i lay out the nittygritty i like the strategy so much that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) decided to finally lay it out in full detail for others to learn

my inspiration for this started after reading and following karstens passive income through option writing from  he lays out his reasoning and thought process way better than i ever could so if you like what you see here go check out his stuff as well for more research and a twist on what im doing

what i do

every monday wednesday  friday i sell open new put credit spreads on spx that expire at the closest expiration so monday i sell spx spreads that expire wednesday wednesday i sell spreads that expire friday friday i sell spreads that expire monday i hold these all the way to expiration and then open a new position with the next expiration  of the time these expire worthless and i collect full premium the other  of the time i suffer a small or large loss over the long run the expected return blows the market out of the waterwhich leads me to

expected return

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been running this since may  and am averaging something around  apy based on max risk for the spread its absurd dont believe me my full trade log is published  and i update it in realtime yes thats my website no im not selling any kind of productservice there more on that later

risk  drawdown

this massive positive return doesnt come without a cost of course and if something sounds too good to be true it usually is and the cost here is that yeah while annual return is a ridiculous  max drawdown can be  or more whaaaaat yeah thats right while these spreads expire worthless  of the time the other  can result in huge losses these losses can accumulate up to  or more depending on the environment

so this is a guaranteed way to blow up your account right well it is if you allocate too much capital to it but if you keep your allocation small which i do then a  drawdown for this one strategy will be a small fraction of your overall portfolio i personally only allocate about  of my total portfolio to this what that means is that ifwhen this trading plan suffers a  loss that only represents  drawdown for my portfolio and i can tap into my other investments to replenish this trading plan

these massive losses do happen but they dont last long i ran this very strategy through covid when vix moved from  to  in a month and my max drawdown was only about  i reloaded from my other investments and this put selling strategy recovered and turned green in  before the market itself didafter i went down 

pennies meet steamroller right

yeah this is pretty close to the definition of picking up pennies in front of a steamroller theres nothing inherently wrong with that if

 the pennies that you collect add up to more than what the steamroller takes away
 you limit allocation so that when the steamroller hits you it doesnt destroy you

  i collect around  premium per position compared to max risk spread width  of the time they expire worthless so i keep the full  the other  of the time i suffer what is usually a large loss averaging around  do the math here    is  gain on the wins    is  loss on the losers    makes for a very positive expected returnso that takes care of  the pennies i collect far outweigh the steamroller when it hits me

  i only allocate  of my overall portfolio to this when the steamroller hits me and results in a  loss for the strategy im not wiped out thats only  drawdown on my account which is easy to recover from this is what so many people miss when talking about the ole steamroller if you just keep allocation in check its okay to get hit by a steamroller every now and then

trade process  timing  strike selection

the process here is simple every mwf afternoon open a new set of put spreads expiring at the next expiration mondays position expires wednesday wednesdays position expires friday fridays position expires monday my short strike is around  delta my long strike is  points below that this results in a short strike around  otm in low iv environments and  otm in high iv environments the long strike will be  otm again depending on iv itll be farther out as vix rises

you only suffer max loss if the sp drops  in a day or two out of absolutely nowhere vix   or if sp drops  in a day or two after freefall has already started in  months and with vix rocketing to  during that timeframe not once has one of my spreads even seen max lossim sure itll happen at some point but if didnt happen in  im curious to see when it would happen

why spx

  expirations available every week mondaywednesdayfriday
 highly liquid
 cashsettled no underlying given to me on assignment
 low trading fees for me personally  your mileage may vary
 beneficial tax treatment  longterm based on irs  contract straddles
 less paperwork to file for taxes futures and index options aggregate together on irs tax forms eliminating  line items from this trading strategy in a year

spx is awesome

alternatives to spx

some of you may not have access to spx options or your account isnt large enough to be handle spx options they are huge a single contract represents k notional the cashsettlement and riskdefined trades help diminish the impact of size but its still a lot of underlying to carry around es futures are half the size and should work as well just be sure you understand fees assignment and liquidity first spy can also work and is even smaller than es again understand assignment of shares and fees you also lose the tax benefit with spy but on smaller accounts this may be the only viable option

more reading  full trade log and performance history

i set up a website dedicated to just this one strategy its not an interactive website or anything im not selling anything or pushing a servicenewsletter its just a place where i can define the strategy in way more detail than iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) done here and also a place where i can maintain a current and updated log of all of my trades and performance history to learn more about the strategy and see actual tradesperformance check out the website

also in case people wonder how and why your strategy has such impressive return estimates much higher than mine you calculate your returns as a  of your valueatrisk i calculate my returns as  of the total portfolio so my  losses and gains are a lot smaller because they are divided by a larger denominator

also one piece of advice dont get too confident that you made it through  this year was surprisingly kind to us vol sellers see 

 august  and february  could have been far worse even though the market didnt drop as much as in  as a general guideline id budget keeping about  of the premium  set aside for losses iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) had much higher premium capture than that  in  about  on average but  is a nice conservative estimate in the years when things dont work so well"

xb",3,"you are close but iv measures the st dev of logreturns not prices  iv is a relic that comes from the generic option pricing model which assumes normally distributed logreturns  you cant have a price go below zero with logreturns

the correct price calculation for a  sd move up over  days is   Eagle Materials Inc (EXP)  sqrt   

and price down is   Eagle Materials Inc (EXP)  sqrt   

also you should be using  days not  days in the calculation since you are trying to measure a  day move

the highlevel approach is that the more you can narrow down the uncertainty and the more dramatic the price change the more surgical you can be in entryexit the less certain you are or the more wishywashy the move the larger the net you have to cast

for example if you think tsla will gradually rise and then suddenly tank  in october of  wait until september to buy a november monthly put on the other hand if you have no clue what tsla will do before the move and have no clue when the move might happen short of sometime in the next  months spread your bets by rolling  DTE Energy Company (DTE) puts every  days

im not a fan of casting a wide net with single entries and far expirations those cost too much up front and you have nothing but theta decay while you wait rolling  DTE Energy Company (DTE) every  days lets you adjust to market conditions once a month manages theta decay and keeps  you on the most liquid monthly expirations and obviously if the trend before the event is gradually down youll be able to take profit off the table earlier albeit at smaller chunks at a time flip side this rolling pattern is the worstcase approach when the stock steadily goes up then tanks in  day",removed,the at the moment delta for the put options will be maximum payout

for those that dont know when you sell a portion of the shares you own the cost basis method tells the irs which of those shares are sold the basis of those shares ultimately decides your gain or loss for the sale

theres one problem with all this  your broker or fund company preset a default cost basis method for you that default method probably wont give the best tax results when you sell shares what you may not know is you can change the default method to the one you want to use talk to your broker after deciding which method works best",wait wouldnt you be assigned another  shares at

Is this normal?,not an experienced option trader but this isnt my first time either using robinhood call option for drn with  strike share price is now approaching  after a gradual  increase throughout the day Eagle Materials Inc (EXP)  i know share price isnt the only determinant in the value of an option but keeping everything in mind that still seems very odd can someone explain what might be going on,2,"you have met up with a fundamental fact of options here is my nearly daily remark upon this fact there are other facts like this waiting to bite you  

this experience is a common experience during the present market phase with higher volatility than in the past and essential to understanding how options work  it is especially important if you buy options out of the money and at the money 
  
an options relationship with the underlying stocks price is not linear 
you can lose nearly the entire value of your option in one day even though the underlying stocks spot price does not change and the option has not yet expired 

there are two components to every option price  
the intrinsic value and the extrinsic value 

the intrinsic value is the immediate inherent value of the option as it relates to the stocks current price  
if the option owner exercises a long debit option they own immediately this is the useful value to the option owner upon exercise of the option   
 
 for a debit long call intrinsic value is the market price of the underlying stock minus the option strike price if this number is negative the intrinsic value is zero  
 for a debit long put intrinsic value is the option strike price minus the market price of the underlying if this number is negative the intrinsic value is zero

the extrinsic value is the remaining value of an options market price and can be  of the options value  an out of the money option has  extrinsic value and zero intrinsic value  it can be quite volatile  the extrinsic value is influenced by interest rates the time value of money market expectations and market anxiety extrinsic value rises and falls in part on on demand for portfolio protection in the marketplace   

 theta decay is the term for time decay of extrinsic value

nbsp

examples  

 if you buy an option on xyz company for  at strike price of  and also xyz the stock has a spot price of  then the intrinsic value of the option is  market  minus option strike price    and the extrinsic value is 

  if the xyz stock goes up to for example to  and also market expectations evaporate that the stock might go to  in the period before the option expires the option could have a market value of    intrinsic value  extrinsic value   the owner of the option in this case has lost a  in the options value compared to what they paid even though the xyz stock went up   this kind of thing happens all of the time and it is why options are hard",vix dropped  could be the reason,depending on brokerage the last trade price may give you an inaccurate impression of your option value particularly in cases like this where the liquidity is terrible  look at the bidask as im seeing an increase in value  you are also long vega but anytime i see these questions its almost always a liquidityui issue
share price,options,"Selling covered calls, strike price lower then share price ?","is it wise to sell covered calls for a strike price under your share price 

i have  shares of crnt currently the stocks at  i got crnt for  per share can i sell covered calls for  strike price if i believe it wont hit  before expire just to collect premium",10,"thats like the entire point of covered calls

why sell shares when you could sell people the dream of being able to buy shares",absolutely,"here are some things to consider 

if you want to keep the stock forever the thing to do is sell the calls at the strike price that the stock is at now in your case   this is the point where the calls have the maximum premium that you are selling to someone else look up the blackscholes model if you dont already know this

forget trying to make up for stock you think you paid to much for the market has no memory of any past price it only knows what someone is willing to pay for it right now and what someone is willing to sell it for right now price is actually irrelevant  all that matters is premium also known as the juice 

if the stock rises  say to   as the expiration date approaches the premium in your sold contract decays away but there is new juice in the  strike price in the next expiration down the road you use a technique called rolling forward to capture more profits by selling more juice

if the stock falls below  when expiration comes you can let the option expire then sell the next at the money call to capture more juice profits

you can also roll down to take more money out of the market  that is the name of the game isnt it to take money out of the market not put money in

if these concepts seem hard to grasp i recommended the book trading in the zone by mark douglas rip many of his seminars are on youtube and they are excellent

options trading,options,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them

first and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options

there are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised

 

now the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information

as for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price

 

i know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario

whether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay

time decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay

time decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches

theta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support

 

although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling

the reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post

regardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time

maybe after this youll see why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns

hope this was helpful let me know what ya think",1359,i understand all this the thing i dont understand is how to not lose all my money,i started trading options this year  and let me tell ya you can be right with calling the direction of the stock and still lose money on your call or put,"step deposit money

options trading,options,3 Step Process To Options Trading,"i have been trading options for over  years and i am frequently asked where can i learn to trade options here is my  step process most of you are already mastering the first two steps and if you are proficient at those the options part is pretty easy

all of your trading has to start with market analysis that means getting your bearings from a technical perspective moving averages volume trendlines momentum and also be aware of the fundamental backdrop earnings interest rates economic data political policies i spend  hours each morning conducting market analysis this is the most critical step and it is the biggest piece of the puzzle more than  of all stocks follow the market if you get this wrong there is a  likelihood you will lose money i always have a  minute chart of the spy up when i am trading and i never take my eye off of it once you have your market bearings you are ready for the next step

lets say that you have concluded that the market is bullish for the next few days and that the uptrend should continue there are not any speedbumps economic events ahead and the downside risk is minimal now it is time to zero in on the best stock

i look for stocks that are moving higher when the market is moving lower i call this relative strength Reliance Steel & Aluminum Company (RS) do not confuse this with the rsi indicator that compares the stocks current move to its recent price movement i find little value in rsi find stocks with relative strength that are moving higher on heavy volume and that have broken through technical resistance these will be your best prospects

if you get the market right and the stock right options are easy they are simply a way for you to increase your leverage heres the rub i am not saying that getting the first two steps is easy it is very difficult and until you hone your skills with steps one and steps two you should not trade options you will simply lose your money faster

basic options buying strategies and vertical spreads are all you need to trade any market scenario your opinion of the market and your confidence in that forecast determine the best options trading strategy along with your opinion of the magnitude and the duration of the expected stock move keep your strategies basic and the positions will be much easier to manage

options are not the starting point they are the icing on the cake market first stock second and options last

i went through the entire process and it culminated with a trade example here is a link to part

options trading,options,Stop falsifying information when applying for options trading.,"this has very clearly become a huge trend of applying for things people dont understand and its about as intelligent as the blonde applying for a credit card and then not understanding they have to pay it back 

and for fucks sake it shouldnt even need to be said but if youre so mentally fragile that you start to feel suicidal after making the trade you didnt understand but that youtuber you like said was a sure thing you shouldnt have been trading in the first place 

educate yourself and youll be able to consistently pull a profit instead of trying to strike it rich understand that you wont pull a ten thousand percent profit every time and that is perfectly okay for you to take your profits before your investment has reached peak value understand that youre not losing by taking  gains if it continues to increase in value afterwards and understand that you lying to your broker just to be able to take more risks only hurts you

some people will most likely think this post is mean or too harsh but the stock market is a harsh mistress and i dont believe that we are doing anyone any good by coddling them and that it only makes the overall problem worse for the record i think brokers current system regarding applying for things like options trading and such is completely broken and actually exchanges these people to lie but the ultimate responsibility still lies with the investor",925,why yes i am a recent college grad  years old and i have  years experience trading iron condors gets approved for level,merrill lynch requires lvl  for buying calls my  years Eagle Materials Inc (EXP) got me lvl,tastyworks pretty much gives anyone the ability to trade options and their sister company tastytrade provides a ton of education on how to trade options if anyone wants educational resources tastytrade is a good place to start and then if you like them you can join their brokerage no lying necessary

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen a lot of i used to trade stocks and now i make hundreds of thousands with options i understand half that is guys marketing their courses 

hope this question is fine to ask on here just am genuinely curious i dont expect myself to make millions but just want some realistic expectations if i work hard at learning this and if im any good at it 
thanks in advance",58,"every gimme has a gotcha 


you can try to learn about the greeks and how they work   but at the end of the day the options greeks come out of the options price they dont determine the options price the market buyers and sellers is what ultimately determines the price black scholes is just a model that describes how the price of options should be based on normal distribution  remember its just a fancy model that is used to help describe the physics of how an options price moves the mode is a good predictor but it isnt the rule of law 



if youre going to go down the path of greeks learn delta theta gamma and vega there are more greeks but those  will cover what you need to know 


delta  you can think of this as the chance that the stock will end at that price its also the amount the  options value will move based on a  move in the stock so say you buy a  call on a stock thats  and it has a  delta and the stock moves to  expect yourself to gain  cents not  on your call option   note closer to expiration the delta starts to collapse meaning a  delta is a lot closer to the stock price at DTE Energy Company (DTE) than at  DTE Energy Company (DTE) 

gamma its a derivative on delta it says how much delta changes with a  move in the stock so did the example above of the delta was  and the gamma was  then a  move would make the delta now change to    note closer to expiration gamma starts to grow exponentially

theta this is the time component of options the options will theoretically lose theta amount of value every day    as you get closer to expiration the theta on options starts to grow exponentially 

vega   kinda hard to explain this one but its essentially how the options price changes according to the volatility of the market for the stock   if vega is high youd have to look at iv rank or iv percentile to get a better picture of this then the options price will be high think Gamestop Corporation (GME) or amc when they were mooning the options vega would explode so the options prices would skyrocket 





now all that knowledge isnt going to help you trade my advice is sell puts on something like slv maybe  delta something like  days out and then  close the position at  days rinse and repeat   do that for a year and since slv is relatively safe you wont lose money but youll learn how options prices get impacted by price movements or by time if slv is too slow for you pick a stock thats under share but more than share and do the same thing","im not really interested in someone starting with k or more making money but the guysgals with small accounts

k is a small account in options terms

think of options trading like doing an engineering degree for  years at the end you are not an engineer but you have the basics of becoming one then it takes another  years of real world application before you become an engineer same with options

dont believe me try it with real money

sorry i cannot be more supportive i have traded options for more than  years and its only in the last  years that i am consistently profitable now i make a very healthy annual percentage return","close to k cumulative last  years  i have tracked every single trade i have done from the beginning  lots of singles and doubles no home runs although i thought i was going to get my first one with Activision, Inc.

is it worth it to subscribe to any of these sites if so which ones do you recommend and why",5,"seeking alpha is probably worse than cramer

wsj is trash

i pay attention to twitter accounts that simply report market related news that are facts not what their opinions are on them

so think walter bloomberg 

i also watch unusual whales and then try to see if any of it lines up with any current political news walter bloomberg tweets anything on twitter anything from potus 

for example i saw that infrastructure was going down i check unusual whales there ended up being a lot of hydrogen options movement then i checked twitter and saw how much hate there was for hydrogen 

went balls deep and made enough to start a day trading account up last augustseptember off that",i have subscriptions for seeking alpha and wsj pretty good but can be a lot of noise especially on sa sometimes,"seeking alpha has a lot of general information thats useful but you have to take a lot of the opinions there with a grain of salt because anyone can write and submit an article for publication and receive payment for it  many of the amateur authors have no clue  
  
some wellknown seeking alpha authors have been caught front running their picks  they created aliases to tout their own articles and some have overstated gains of their previous recommendations  there has been no penalty from management because seeking alphas agenda is to drive readers toward ubscription    
  
seeking alpha will defend their authors even when they are abjectly wrong to the point of censuring readers who correct author misstatements many participants who contribute a wealth of information in the comment section have left the site in frustration passively facilitating sas agenda

stock market prices,options,Can rich people dump money into a stock to manipulate options prices?,"i just had an idea suppose that youre a rich person with at least  billion dollars on hand to exist maybe not all your money but in an investment account that you control

find a stock with an options market but low trading volume for example  current price  average volume  it has a call option at 

buy up as many of those  call options as you can all expiring on the same day buy some of the further out ones too as many call options as you can get without massively distorting the market you can buy them gradually over a long period just as long as theyre all the same expiration

then on the day they expire start buying the stock like crazy buy buy buy place a massive market order all at once youre not trying to get good fills youre just trying to drive the stock price up as much as possible right before trading closes now all your options are deep in the money sell them for a profit you could even go short the calls to get rid of some of your stock sell the stock gradually over the next few months to get rid of it or keep it if you want i guess youll probably lose money on the stock itself but make a killing on the options trade

i dont have a solid calculation of the numbers of this though how much would the price of a stock move if you suddenly dumped say twice the average daily volume into it all at once",439,"people dont seem to be discussing this seriously which is disappointing

what youre describing can happen but likely not to the extent that youre imagining since this stock and presumably the options have such low volume the manipulator here is going to be driving up these prices as they buy them and driving down the prices as they sell them ie slippage

at first the options they buy will be fair value but as they buy them the price will go up and at a certain point the price will be too high for them to make a profit this assumes they can actually find enough people to write the options for them which is certainly not guaranteed

now they have these options and on expiration day they drive up the price of the stock they execute their calls and receive the shares all they have to do is sell the shares at this inflated price to make their profit except theyre the ones that drove up the price in the first place so as they sell the price quickly crashes back to its fair value less then strikes they bought them at in the first place or they cant find any buyers and up with a bunch of shares

between these effects this plan wont go as smoothly as you might think in fact slippage is a serious problem when you have a ton of capital and hedge funds have to account for this in their strategies of course that isnt to say that you cant make money doing this its just not as easy or lucrative as youd think when assuming no slippage it can also be really risky especially considering the situations that have occurred with the meme stocks pump n dump schemes this year",instead of laughing and mocking at him you assholes should respectfully answer and encourage his questions you know nothing about this guy as far as we know he can be a  year old high school kid who is learning about options so he comes here to absorb what he can  options are complicated to get a solid understanding of and remember you too were once asking questions like this,"manipulate is a rather strong word in this scenario its not like the market cant see what the rich guy is doing high dollar volume orders get additional scrutiny as well even from an institutional trading desk

but yeah someone with a big bag of money can move the market on a low price low volume stock for sure there are checksbalances in place to make sure thats done in an orderly way so that the market can respond but i dont believe those checksbalances are meant to stop someone from doing it"

stock market prices,options,What I Learned From Citadel’s Training Software,"introduction

when i was a finance undergrad one of the classes i most looked forward to was financial trading strategies while other classes were academic with textbooks and powerpoint slides our professor was a former market maker who taught us through handson experience throughout that semester our professor gave us  using the same software citadel uses to train their traders  simulated trading cases each case taught us to trade from the perspective of a different market participant our grades didnt just depend on how much money we made but on the pnl compared to our classmates at the time the stakes seemed higher than trading with real money

here are some things i learned during that semester

 isolate your exposures and hedge whenever possible

 the stat Arbitron Inc. (ARB) case

in the stat Arbitron Inc. (ARB) case we were commodity traders trying to run a location arbitrage strategy we could buy oil in cheaper locations and transport it to places where oil was more expensive the market was compensating us for providing supply in markets with too much demand for oil and providing demand in places with too much supply however we couldnt hedge our positions so our risk was that oil prices worldwide would fall before we could offload our inventory

this case emphasized the importance of hedging even though every trade i made had a positive expected value many of my trades were losers when oil prices fell i lost money because i wasnt just trading the relative prices between locations but i also had unhedged exposure to the global oil market

 the portfolio management case

in the portfolio management case we were pms managing a portfolio of  stocks our edge was that we knew the fair value of each of them in real life firms might have a team of analysts studying each stock and not giving cnbc interviews our job was to take long positions in undervalued or short overvalued stocks however our risk was that the stocks might move even further from fair value in the short term

i quickly learned to take opposing positions to limit my risk to the overall market if i were only long a bunch of stocks i could sustain heavy losses during market downturns similarly rally would demolish a shortonly portfolio combining long and short positions made my portfolio more or less neutral to the broader market even if there were no overvalued stocks i made sure to short something  this insulated me from market crashes and allowed me to leverage my long positions in undervalued stocks safely

in options trading hedging is even more important many options traders who are wheeling selling cashsecured puts and covered calls have a lot of long equity short volatility positions and should be hedging their portfolios maybe shorting an index to balance out the long equity exposure of all these puts may be a good idea delta hedging is also an option buying options elsewhere to hedge the short volatility exposure from these wheel positions can also protect your portfolio from drawdowns

 size your trades based on your edge

 the etf arbitrage case

in the etf arbitrage simulation we were aps who could create and redeem shares of an etf when the price of the etf was higher than that of the stocks in the etf we could buy the stocks and create shares of the expensive etf to sell similarly when the etf became cheaper than the stocks we could buy the cheap etf and break it down into expensive stocks and sell them the main risk was execution risk the chance that our algo was broken or it was too slow executing trades after the arbitrage was already gone

this trading simulation was reasonably straightforward but taught me one important lesson when there is an arbitrage an edge with nearly no risk we must trade as much as possible before its gone in most simulations i learned to maintain reasonable position sizes however etf arbitrage was nearly riskfree provided i wrote the algo correctly if i didnt trade aggressively my classmates would be and the arbitrage opportunity would disappear

in the options markets we should take many trades in small sizes systematic trading strategies such as selling weekly or monthly spy options tend to be profitable over time but only if the trader is careful with their position sizing

 work harder than anyone else

this should be obvious but for some reason it isnt many compete to make money in the markets my class was no different the pnl across the various trading simulations determined what your grades were going to be while we had some trading simulations that we could trade by hand we could choose to write algorithms to trade for us instead having studied each case beforehand i spent hours outside of class writing python scripts to trade on my behalf this allowed me to execute trades faster and more accurately than my classmates ever could by hand

 the liability trading case

in a liability trading simulation we were brokers handling large orders for other institutional clients our edge was that as brokers we would receive bids for a large amount of stock at a slight premium or be offered large blocks of shares at a discount however because these trades were so large we couldnt just close our positions immediately we had to split up our trades into several orders so they wouldnt push the market around too much our risk was the possibility of the stock moving against us while we tried to sell our shares or cover our short positions over time

many of my classmates traded this simulation by hand they would receive an order use an excel spreadsheet to evaluate each trade and offload their positions manually those who traded by hand needed up to a minute to process trades as a result they were exposed to the market for too long and many trades moved against them on the other hand i processed orders in four to five seconds because i was using an algo to trade

 an edge exists for a reason its always about providing value

not a single trading simulation involved technical analysis in every trading simulation we had a role and a service to provide we had a reason our trading strategies were profitable we provided value in the market

liability traders help execute large trades for clients lacking the infrastructure or patience market makers provide the best bid and offer giving traders better prices when they want to enter and exit positions portfolio managers can help resolve supply and demand imbalances in the market buying oversupplied oversold securities they can also short highly demanded overvalued stocks finally aps help keep etf prices in line with stock prices through arbitrage

retail traders should be no different the easiest services we can provide to the market involve risk premiums and price inefficiencies

risk premiums involve holding risk that the market tends to compensate traders for risk premiums include long equity  fixedincome positions supplying equity and debt capital and short options positions supplying options remember that not all risk is created equal day trading is risky but arguably provides no value to the market

trading price inefficiencies generally involve providing liquidity to market participants who might be forced to trade at bad prices we can get paid by taking the other side of forced trades which helps our counterparty get a better price more on this in the next point 

 not everyone is doing things for the same reason trade with people who are forced to

in real markets many people are forced to trade at bad prices many institutional funds have rules that require them to buy options as a hedge no matter the price some hedge funds sell their lowerquality holdings before their annual reports so they dont have to explain to investors why theyre bagholding the latest meme stock they then repurchase these stocks after their report if enough hedge funds sell the same stocks at the same time these stocks temporarily become too cheap

 the market making case

the marketmaking simulation was one of the hardest we provided quotes on three stocks and our job was to earn money collecting the bidask spread the hard part was keeping the spread since we were often on the wrong side of trades a wave of buying would leave us short stock while the market rallied and a wave of selling would leave us holding the bag while we collected the spread with every trade keeping our positions neutral was extremely difficult

im not going to lie my marketmaking algorithm was terrible i would get flooded with orders on one side and be forced to dump my inventory at even worse prices however i noticed that everyone was panic buying or dumping stock at the same times i was so in my next iteration i decided to change my strategy rather than competing with other mms for orders i would wait for a wave of buy orders and join them these orders alongside my own caused my classmates algorithms to shift their prices higher and higher as they desperately attempted to cover their short positions i would then helpfully sell them my stock at inflated prices sometimes i would see a wave of sell orders and short the stock knowing i could buy back it at a discount as the other market makers tried to dump their inventory

did i end up successfully building a marketmaking program unfortunately no but i made a lot of money

and that class was the sweetest a iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) ever earned",1571,this may be the first useful interesting post iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen in trading subs in years thanks,"rather than competing with other mms for orders i would wait for a wave of buy orders and join them these orders alongside my own caused my classmates algorithms to shift their prices higher and higher as they desperately attempted to cover their short positions

trade,options,UBER trade advice,in january  i sold uber covered   c it was  at the time its now  my cost per share is  on the underlying stock bad move what can i do to minimize the damage,0,"congrats youve made max profit

you could buy to close and roll it out to a higher strike further out","you really cant im not sure the comments here all totally get what situation youre in

i mean yeah you can just go with new calls at are otm or still itm but closer to current price

but either way youd be continuing to bet against rhe company and eating some of the in a sense theoretical loss you accrued

you can either let it ride and hope something catastrophic happens or save yourself a few dollars by closing early either way barely makes a difference and at least you lost on opportunity cost more so than flat cash","if you do nothing youll either collect the full premium on  and sell your shares at cost or collect the full premium and keep your shares i think theres a good chance it will be the latter 

but if you really want that  price increase and to keep your stock you should close now and take the loss 

rolling makes no sense youd just be sacrificing the premium you collected and extending the risk that uber falls below"

trade,options,My 1st Options Trade! + $175,"i bout my st ever option this past week saw all the hype on rkt and knew in my gut it was gonna crash hard made a c put just  and sold at

wish me luck boys",141,nice my first few were wins as well but just remember your gut feeling may be wrong so just have an exit strategy before hand by that i mean at the very least decide beforehand what profit or loss you can handle and stick to it hoping a bad option will bounce back or hoping for more profit will bite you in the ass quite often anywho grats and good luck,cool do keep in mind that a  gain every month as an apr is over  you only have to double a penny every day for a month to make a million take small sure bites so i corrected it based on the comments this got never be afraid to learn and thank you all for making the conversation valuable,thanks fellas im definitely not greedy green is green if i start seeing red will pull out and minimize the pain im just excited i finally felt confident enough to try it out n didnt get burned immediately
trade,options,Does anyone only swing trade spy?,im starting to shift my focus of finding good setups throughout the market to just mainly focusing on spy im thinking this because you dont have to worry about earnings dates or anything tight spreads on the options chain and that spy will always go up as long as you have the time and theres no major reasons for a crash i was just wondering if anyone else takes this approach to mainly just swingday trading spy and if not what are your go to stocks to trade,813,i trade spy options exclusively,iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been totally thinking about this and very curious to see the replies,"spy trading is harder than trading other securities with earnings dates etc

the reason is exactly that spy has no events so thus when you make a poor trade say you buy a long option for too much or sell a short option for too little these events can rightsize for you through iv changes this doesnt happen with spy

i am not saying dont do it but dont think its the silver bullet to avoiding these issues it isnt its almost a catalyst for the inverse its a far more stable roller coaster but with far less opportunity for when youre wrong to work out in your favor"
trade,options,The Genius Behind Nany Pelosi's Trades,"one of the greatest traders of our time  nancy pelosi joking aside i was looking through her recent trades and couldnt help but notice how well structured they are her choices for the longs are very similar to how i set up my diagonals

 shes using long calls as a surrogate long stock position to take advantage of the leverage afforded by options for example the Google Inc. (GOOG) trade cost around k for her to put on a similar stock trade wouldve been around mm
 she uses two different long call strategies based on her disposition towards the stock
    for more developed equities like Google Inc. (GOOG) mu dis she selected slightly shorter term expirations but went further itm this allows the trade to behave more like long stock while decreasing the impact of theta decay on the options
    for more growth oriented equities like rblx and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM) she selected leap expirations and chose strikes closer to the money although still itm this offers more growth opportunity in the options if directionally correct while still limiting the impact of theta decay on the longs
 she selected all established products with promising lines of business going forward dis surprised me a little bit but since covid theyve been pivoting more and more to telecomm so i can understand her thought process the
 the choices she made are not the cheapest method to gain exposure however these are well structured trades diamond hands pelosi at it again

edits for all the keyboard warriors  
im not suggesting that pelosi is actually any kind of great trader  the post is generally satire the focus is more on the construction of the trades  
the post isnt about how she selects the products if theres insider trading etc   
to clarify nancys husband makes most of the trades and she is required to report them i have absolutely no idea who is actually structuring the trades if they have an advisor etc again calling her the great trader is more of a joke than anything",1408,im hoping someone makes an etf called senate or something to track the trades i would wheel that etf so hard,people keep saying she when her husband actually owns an investment firm,isnt her husband in vc or something similar i think technically her trades are actually executed by her husband it woukd make sense theyre so well constructed given his background
trade,options,Re-visiting My /NG Trade,"ngk  natural gas futures 

recently sold to open a natural gas put due to the steep decline it has been in its own way for around  days or so ng prices are significantly down relative to the spike we had in  around  the low is marginally below  it has rallied  from lows and i still believe it will make higher lows

 i wanted to revisit my original post to give more clarification about why i chose to trade ng despite the often tail risk in this commodity to the upside and downside i will show the pros and cons to this trade and management potential throughout the post

     drop to strike  in  DTE Energy Company (DTE)

hypothetically if the strike were to at the moment tomorrow this is a round about loose way to see risk

      unrealized loss
      margin increase

tos can show vol adj if you would want to calculate that into the unrealized loss and margin requirements in general there would extremely unlikely chance that the  put strike goes itm in  DTE Energy Company (DTE) next part will show more of the pros and cons as far as charts go

    charts



i placed a white line close to where the  put is it  cents above the strike because i couldnt zoom out more its mainly to show far out the strike is relative to  years of natural gas



 weeks the option was trading at  credit  if there is a pullback and depending on my portfolio i will add another contract if it upticks close or above  febs high

i will continue to roll out up or down if the iv environment stays somewhat bid and my sentiment is similar though iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been burnt on nat gas products i do like it as a different asset relative to the market index which is where most of my risk is towards

    disclaimer

definitely not recommending this to beginners or traders who dont have tools on their brokerage trading account to analyze risk commodities are a completely different beast commodities generally have more volatility and entail more tail risk i can completely afford if ng goes to  i mainly wanted to reupdate my old post to further reflect my thought process as i did a poor job originally",5,deleted,i just closed my short puts during this recent run up and am hoping to reenter if we get closer to  again,"i think everything is explained correctly but im not following why you would want to put on this trade 

  
so to summarize on one june nymex hh contract youre collecting  up front with the dollar risk of if the price goes to the at the moment strike of  next day youd have an estimated risk and margin increase of what you listed total  which i agree would be unlikely there is also the assignment risk if the option expires in the money then youd be obligated to purchase  mmbtus so k needed in margin or cash actual capital required buying power is about  so roc of about  on this singular trade max loss of  if the gas contract goes to zero which again id agree would be quite unlikely

  
while your riskreward on collateral is fine at  your riskreward on the prices falling between current to strike price let alone max risk is terrible the actual max return plummets to probably below  depending on how much margin you have to lock up you have some comfort that if your put gets assigned at below  youd be long  mmbtus of gas which is not bad  
the riskreward ratio is just not worth it on those numbers there are definitely better ways to add delta to your portfolio or short vol or find a different strike with more extrinsic and hedge with a long put

in conclusion squeezing out   cents per contract over  DTE Energy Company (DTE) is not the best position to be holding i mean you definitely can and i would think if youre willing to put up s of margin if prices drop below this level you can probably get all that premium but seeing how you havent listed out the gas fundamental outlook for this spring this is at least a moderate risk extremely low reward sort of trade i would advise just leaving this alone 

now if prices drop  from here back to  or less then this would be a different discussion and this sort of trade would be more interesting to put on then"

im starting with a small acocunt to see if i can successfully grow it one of the stocks i was able to select through my screener was rpc Suncor Energy (Inc.)ticker RPC, Inc. (RES) and wanted to sell a put however there seem to be no options contracts below the current stock price using interactivebrokers

is there a reason for this

thank you in advance for your advice",1,"one of the guidelines for trading options is to use liquid tickers and options  these tickers will tend to enable fast fills for better prices due to the higher volume of options being traded

illiquid options have the risk of not filling or filling for a worse price due to the often wide bidask  these can also be difficult to close since so few trade them  these low liquidity tickers and options should be cautiously considered because of these risks  it is always advantageous to trade higher liquidity tickers and options

low volume tickers will have a limited option chain and strikes which is the case for RPC, Inc. (RES) as it is a very low volume ticker

the tos platform does show put strike prices below the current ticker price at  and  however there is no open interest so these are illiquid  ibkr may not show these strikes because of the lack of liquidity contact them to ask",there are puts below the current price of  the  and  strikes but they have no bids your broker may not be listing the strikes with no bids,in addition to what others have said sometimes brokerage platforms are configured by default not to show all strikes  look for a setting that determines whether or not to show all strikes

im sorry in advance for how stupid this question might be and i appreciate the brain cells you burned to actually answer",0,you already answered it yourself but yes the premium due to intrinsic value  theta will be more than what youd make go and look at the stock price vs itm put premium for any stock the more liquid and lower iv the closer it will be in terms of strike minus premium vs current stock price,"i am sure many will go on about intrinsic and extrinsic value and yes you should know that but really your question is simple math which if you are doing options you have to be willing to do

first off use the optionchain people trading off charts  i do not agree with you should be using the optionchain so in your case lets do the 

nov  put  so you sell it for 

you buy it for  appox

first of all congrats on going to an hs that had a personal finance class thats extremely rare despite the desperate need to address financial illiteracy i participated in a similar contest in hs but it was in my science class because my science teacher happened to be a resource simulations nerd like civilization and age of empires video games

find a loophole in the rules and exploit it like a hedge fund might or commit outright fraud like ftx if were going to teach bad financial habits to teens we might as well go all the way why stop at half measures

for example in my class i found a loophole in the way the teacher was simulating bonds and resource management students started with random resources random widgets to build that required resources they might not have and cash you could also trade sim stocks or sim bonds i realized that the rate of return on the bonds was enough to beat any of the other investments or revenue from selling widgets in just one week bonds matured daily and i could reinvest total proceeds daily so the magic of compounding so i went to every student that needed the resources i had and swapped them for cash then yolod all that cash into bonds i won by a huge margin with almost zero risk and producing zero widgets gdp was zero just like a hedge fund","put it all on slightly otm weeklies on whatever volatile stock you want the goal of this exercise is to increase variance even if the teacher doesnt realize it

for example if you can bet it all on an even odds coin flip you approach winning the game half the time in a class of  thats fantastic as other smart people realize this is the game you have to put in all on worse odds with a higher payout the more people in the competition the higher variance you want","we had the same except we waited for a month i x my money ngl i was pretty proud

stock market,options,Can Wallstreetbets beat the market? - I analyzed 20MM+ comments made on WSB in 2021 to see if you should pay attention to their stock picks. Here are the results.,"like chan found a bloomberg terminal

this is how wallstreetbets define their community for those who dont know  is one of the biggest stock market communities in the world having more than mm members its where millions are made and lost every day on outrageous bets and the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins

whether its for the insane yolos posted every day or breaking robinghood with infinite leverage plays or the legendary shortsqueeze involving Gamestop Corporation (GME) wallstreetbets is where the action goes down  sums up the absolute chaos that rwallstreetbets is

but what we are interested in is to see if we can beat the market by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets after all





data

reddits praw api and pushshift api were used to obtain the data for this analysis there were more than  million comments and posts made on wsb in  i have had a vm running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since dec

the summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data you can get it from 



analysis

ahh this is where it gets tricky there are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from wsb since there are millions of comments its not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit

so what i have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day  why i settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when heshe would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions the more the chances of investing in the said stock

considering the practical limitations i kept the cutoff at the top  stocks once we have found the top  discussed stocks of that day we invest in them at the market close then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a one week

b one month

c till date  from the date of investment to today

the benchmark for comparison is spy we will compare the returns against spy to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by spy during the same time period 



results

before we jump into the returns here is a visualization of how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in wsb



 in case the visualization is not loading  



we would have made a grand total of  investments  in  following this strategy we would have lost money on more than  over the next week and more than  over the next month but if you consider till date we are slightly above  if you compare this to spy its an extremely poor performance as during the same period spy would have given a positive return of  over one week  over one month and  till date as spy is trading at an alltime high now

but the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately  out of the  stocks you pick even if you get  wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high which is what wsb is aiming for  its definitely not for safe plays

so how has the average performance of wsb picks fared



would you look at that wsb recommendations have hands down beaten spy across all time periods it gave a  overperformance over the period of one week and  over one month and a whopping  if you had held on to your stocks

but keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top  list



Gamestop Corporation (GME) has been in the top discussed stocks in  of the days and on average you would have gained  if you invested in it every day both amc and tsla are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly only bb clov and wish on average have lost money 

now that our main question is out of the way we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns



unsurprisingly gamestop and amc are at the top of the pile with Gamestop Corporation (GME) returning an insane  in one week even if you remove Gamestop Corporation (GME) and amc due to the unlikely scenario of a shortsqueeze the other  stocks would have doubled your investment in one week 



for every winner there are bound to be losers if you bought into Gamestop Corporation (GME) at the top of the rally you would have lost  of your investment in the next week all the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag

but what if you did not want to invest in  stocks every day what if you only wanted to invest in the top stock of the day ie the one creating the most discussion would you have beaten the market



unsurprisingly you would have beaten the market by a wide margin this is mainly due to the insane returns generated by Gamestop Corporation (GME) amc tsla etc which came to the top of the list you are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks

there are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

 as explained in footnote there are  days of missing data  though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as its lesser than  of the total days in the analysis
 this analysis does not consider options which is a big part of what wsb is made of the returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
 we have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies the results might be different if we expand our time horizon
 finally the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock i would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company my hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments a part of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works  stay tuned 



conclusion

before starting the analysis i fully expected to end it with

the real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way

i was expecting that the chatter in wsb would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag

but i was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat spy in returns that too across different time periods

either its due to the selffulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more or it might just be that wsb is the place where we can successfully leverage the 

whatever the case may be you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies  in one week only to drop  in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year for that you are rewarded with marketbeating returns

footnotes

 during the Gamestop Corporation (GME) rally in january the traffic was so high that the vm failed i have used pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible but keep in mind that there are  days of missing data from th jan to th feb and  days of missing data in april nd week

 to find the most popular tickers i used a base of around  stock tickers that i got from IDEX Corporation (IEX) cloud the program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post this is by far the most dataintensive exercise i have done if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join we processed more than  billion rows to find the most popular tickers

 if spy was in the top  tickers we would invest in that as well i feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile

 its lesser than the expected  investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss footnote  and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers eg aphira due to which we could not get the financial data from yahoo finance





 just as easily

disclaimer i am not a financial advisor",1134,"either its due to the selffulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter 

no its not either thats the answer same with stocktwits chatter rises with a stocks movement 

wsb isnt useless tho there have been scientific papersreports written that show that E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) on the sub does predict stocks going up but the quality of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) rapidly declined after the Gamestop Corporation (GME) thing","the overperformance makes sense to me due to the fact that these tickers become popular when they move a ton  dfvs original post on Gamestop Corporation (GME) was buried it wasnt until the stock started rocketing that the ticker chatter blew up  a lot of wsbers dont pay attention to the actual E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) there and just buy the top and sell the bottom  im on the retroactive prophecy side  

that being said really cool study and it is interesting that youd beat the market if you were to follow the plays there early enough",there are kids in there who have no idea what they are getting into and losing boat load of moneyrarely you ll see couple of people posting massive gains but most are losing big time have seen guys asking how to sell options after throwing like k on otms
trading strategy,options,My most profitable options trading strategy: 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condors,"in april i started trading the DTE Energy Company (DTE) breakeven iron condor strategy this has so far been my profitable strategy

since a new year has started i have summed up my results from this strategy after  trading days and  individual trades

using an average buying power of up to    dollars i have made  dollars on this strategy during these nine months  for me that is a fantastic return at least compared to other strategies i have tried it is also less stressful than other DTE Energy Company (DTE) strategies as you rarely experience days with big losses

here is the essence of the strategy

i sell iron condors on spx with the delta on the shorts between  and  the distance to the longs are from  to  points on spx  i try to collect the same premium on both sides

immediately afterward i enter stop losses for each side for just a little more than the total premium collected for the iron condor  since usually only the stop loss on one side is hit this means that the losses are kept at a minimum hence the name breakeven

the tight stop loss of course leads to more losses of my  trades   have been losers and   have been winners but since the average winner is  times larger than the average loser the strategy has a positive expectancy

there are of course risks  the biggest being double stop losses that happened in   of my trades so far another risk as with any DTE Energy Company (DTE) strategy is bad stop loss fills

from my perspective the most positive with the strategy is that losses are kept so small but to achieve this stop losses are an absolute must

if you are interested in learning more i have done a detailed writeup of how i trade DTE Energy Company (DTE) breakeven iron condors on my web page",677,DTE Energy Company (DTE) gang wins and wins glad youre finding success with it,"if you search for  DTE Energy Company (DTE) tammy chambless you will find a youtube video and links to a presentation she does that goes into a great deal of detail on strike selection and stop loss selection  it includes some backtesting showing which have the greatest expected value

edit corrected spelling of last name","this strategy is the definition of picking up pennies in front of the steamroller stop losses are crucial

i ran this for a long time with an extremely high win rate but all it took was one crazy close that pumped like  points to wipe out months of gains"
trading strategy,options,Painfully simple trading strategies that you had success with,"whats the simplest trading strategy you used that in hindsight was either really dumb or just lucky that worked for any prolonged period of time 

mine was jumping on the ripper  mins out of the gate on any of the faang or big tech names during the spring last year somehow this worked for like  straight months at a pretty decent rate and i grew my account by almost  id check futures see if we were up or down going into the open look at how the foreign markets closed out look at the big names and see if anything had gapped and hone in on the largest overnight movers in that tech or large cap sphere using robinhood charts and really zero technical analysis aside from a pretty elementary understand of candlesticks id read just half of the first m candle and if it pushed hard which everything does right at open i would jump in at the cheapest otm contract that fit my normal position size would normally get a continuation up until like  a slight pull back then continue up until the real reversal sometime around  id usually punch out right at the first sign of reversal around  which meant the first long wick candle i saw id bail out ended up leaving a lot of meat on the bone on multiple occasions and id check back around noon to see the contract up like another  but the goal was to lock in profit in a short time and get back to the day job 

kind of comical how well it worked and how much beginners luck it was but then again expectations were basically zero so the whole mental side of it never got in the way kind of fascinating to think about that too and how my own ignorance was a blessing to that style iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried to go back and do it a few times seeing if i can reignite that but i honestly get in my own way with it i now know too much or think i do which i clearly do not and either get spooked in one way or just get overwhelmed with all the different info and make the wrong choice 

either way would love to hear some other stupidly simple strategies that worked at some point",828,"buy super cheap way otm microsoft options like  days out wait until the price went up then drop them i was averaging  a month when i first started with options with that

then i discovered debit spreads and it all went to hell",sell covered calls theta gang sends their regards,"heres one that i had similar success with i still use it sometimes i would find a stock that was hot with day traders at the moment i would wait untill friday near close most day traders dont hold over the weekend i would buy the stock then sell again monday around  when they were peaking again this is a stock strategy not an options strategy  but its simple purely market mechanics no technical no E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) buy friday sell monday
edit dont let the cat out of the bag though guys or well have to start buying monday and selling friday"
trading strategy,options,This has been my most profitable 0DTE options trading strategy,"for  months the DTE Energy Company (DTE) breakeven iron condor has been my most profitable options strategy in fact only one month january  ended with a loss

many have asked how the strategy did in the turbulent first half of  so i decided to do a new writeup you find the article here 

the strategy is quite simple i sell iron condors on spx at    delta at different times of the day  i set separate stop losses on each of the two spreads equal to the total premium of the ic typically i add  dollars on top of that usually i let the iron condors expire but i will also sometimes close them early to lock in some profit 

this is a very tight stop loss compared to what most people do and yes it will lead to more losses yet the strategy as such has proven profitable

here is the summary after trading this strategy from april  until today

 i have done  trades usually i do  trades per day
 the win rate has been   and the loss rate   this has stayed very consistent during this period
 all trades are with one contract only  and i will never commit more than  usd in buying power which means that i will have a maximum of  trades on simultaneously but usually less
 i have made  dollars on the strategy so far for the oneyear period of august  to july  i made  which is   of my max buying power committed to the strategy
 the average win  dollars is  times as high as the average loss  dollars  hence the positive expectancy despite most trades being losses
 the biggest risk to the strategy is double stop losses this has happened in   of my trades this percentage has stayed quite consistent as well during the whole period

this is not the only DTE Energy Company (DTE) strategy i do on spx but i like that i rarely have days with big losses it fits my trading style and risk willingness 

hope you find it interesting",419,i was shocked at the low win rate and high profit i guess i dont understand how you are managing the stops what i thought you meant is each wing stops at the full credit of the entire ic plus  so if max expiration profit of the ic is  you stop either wing at a loss of  or less which means the most the surviving wing can make is  do you count that as a win or a loss i dont see how such a strategy produces those average gainloss numbers with that win rate so i must be misunderstanding something,what platform are you using,there are many people using spyspx options as warranty against a big market swing then on the other side are traders who have statistically slight profit for selling such warranty to these people but they have to develop and polish a strategy minimizing a risk of total wipeout in case of black swan event where even automatic stop loss orders would fail
trading strategy,options,Most leveraged option trading strategy for a strategy,"hi folks

i have developed a long strategy with  win rate the strategy is aimed for being a profitloss in  weeksthe price traget is like  usd above from current price

exif spot price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is usd my strategy predicts with  accuracy if price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) will reach  usd over the next  weeks timeframe

the challenge with this strategy is that we dont know when NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)  would reach that price target in the  week timeframe ie NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) could reach Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A . (PT) hypothetically tomorrow or may be at the end of second weeki havent found a single strategy that could cover both these scenarios ex short dated options provide maximum leverage if say NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) reached the price traget in  day  but a calendar spread  weeks could give good return if say the price reached the target in  weeksi am not considering butterfly as it only gains value around option expiry and around the short strike levels

my question is  could there be any strategy that could give like  return for price target  being reached in a short time frame or price target being reached in a little longer time ex weeks

nbi have already played around with optionstrat and still could not find anything solid

editi may not have been clear when i say return i mean return on riskthis is different from return on my opening cost

editthe reason for  return is to have a positive expectancy for the strategytjeoretivally even a  return would give me  return on averagehowever i need to aim higher to account for  market turmoils that could break all strategies

thanks in advance",1,yes its called long at the moment calls dont overthink it if you have  odds then bet according to kelly criterion and remember to post your loss porn,if anyone knows that strategy then that person is multi billionaire or even first individual trillionaire i am guessing that person wont tell that secret to open public either if they know,and when this inevitably stops working and it will youll be back to scratching your head on what to do
trading strategy,options,Options trading strategy,"im new to options trading so please forgive me if im being a dumbass and missing something obvious but why would the following strategy not work

before something is released that could either make or break a company eg quarterly earnings set up a straddle which i believe profits if the stock goes to either extremes and be guaranteed a profit since you know that the stock will definitely move by a large margin when this information is released",4,"guaranteed profit since you know the stock will definitely  move by a large margin

you either have inside information and if you trade on it you are committing a crime or you are just pure speculating

no such thing as a guaranteed profit","assuming youre talking long straddles here how do you know that the stock will guaranteed move by a large margin what do you do if it moves massively in after hours and then at morning open its neutral 

also volatility has expanded greatly before earnings volatility has a huge impact on options prices after earnings volatility usually collapses which tanks down the options prices",until you get iv crushed you should paper trade strategies first youll see firsthand why this wont usually work although it may have for tsla and Intel Corporation (INTC) but that is because they may have moved further than expected
trading strategy,options,Summary of Carter's Trading Strategy From TastyTrade Rising Star Interview,"greetings traders

Tommy Hilfiger Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) Inc (TOM) sosnoff of tastytrade  a young trader named carter in a live stream from thu  dec  if you dont want to watch the interview heres a summary of his strategy

trader

carter dobbelmann a yearold from san jose ca

claim to fame

turned  into  within  years

affiliations

 hes on hourglass trader google it
 he has replied to comments on the tastytrade video

strategy selling volatility

 exclusively trades options
 roughly follows what tastytrade recommends
 initially gambled with Swiss Exchange (SIX) significantly otm long calls on tsla to go from  to  without knowing anything about the stock market options or trading and getting extremely lucky then gambled  on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) calls and blew away  to drop down to  after learning a more reasonable way of trading he looks for highiv underlyings and

 shorts puts for a credit
 shorts call spreads for a credit and
 shorts put spreads for a credit

 because he sells high volatility hes always looking at iv rank

tactics

 trades with the trend of the underlying using vertical spreads
 runs short call spreads when a stock breaks down and short puts spreads when it rallies
 if he sees evidence that an active play is reversing hell add the opposite spread type from what he initially did if he shorted a call spread hed short a put spread or if he shorted a put spread hed short a call spread

trade parameters

 sets otm striking prices going a little above or below the expected move based on   and ta
 uses DTE Energy Company (DTE)    days usually not more than  days on individual companies
 uses DTE Energy Company (DTE)    on spx

underlyings

 is indifferent to the underlying
 says he plays indexes eg spx
 initially he traded clov and amc
 he recently played si and Gamestop Corporation (GME)

trading activity

 he places  to  trades per day
 he maintains a portfolio of fifteen concurrent positions with many different underlyings
 with a  account hes likely risking  on each position

profittaking

 he exits whenever he captures  to  of the maximum theoretical profit usually closer to the latter
 because he uses distributed expirations eg DTE Energy Company (DTE)     days he takes profits virtually every day

risk management

 if he ran a short call spread and the underlying kept moving up hed roll the spread up and widen the striking prices
 this implies that if he ran a short put spread and the underlying keeps moving down hed roll the spread down and widen the striking prices
 he doesnt hold beyond the point of capturing  of the maximal theoretical profit to try to minimize risk
 he manages risk very actively and aggressively

unknown or unanswered questions

 how he builds a watchlist
 what times of day he typically entersexits trades
 quantity of each trade type
 scaling strategy
 underlying selection criteria
 DTE Energy Company (DTE) criteria
 triggers to roll a trade
 triggers to exit a trade
 spread width
 average number of distinct underlyings in his portfolio
 win rate
 average profit per trade

my thoughts

this gives us an outline of what hes doing but the devil is in the details and a lot is missing without knowing what iv rank threshold and other criteria hes using for scanning for underlyings the spread width what decisionmaking criteria he uses to trigger a roll etc we just dont have enough information to be able to try to replicate this

we also dont know anything about how hes making decisions about where the market is likely to go overall trading during the week of mon  dec  might be dangerous because more macroeconomic data is being released on tue  dec the cpi will be released the following day the fed will announce its interest rate decision at  pm E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ET) followed half an hour later by the jpows press conference it would be imprudent to try to trade oblivious to these important macroeconomic catalysts

this interview is interesting but ultimately leaves us guessing without additional information and a comprehensive list of trades over a threemonth period so that we could look at the transaction times and replay the price action to understand the decisionmaking i think that its impossible to truly figure out what a trader is doing and whether it could have a sustainable edge what would help the most is an excel spreadsheet containing every trades transaction time action and a justification for that action its impossible to reverseengineer what weve heard in just the interview well enough to put it to the test

we can reduce the unknowns by just focusing on spx if someone can track carter down it would be interesting to get him to fill in the blanks we really need to understand how he minimizes losses from positions that go against him to manage risk aggressively what triggers him to roll a position and how soon in the life cycle of a trade thats in trouble does he do this

artem",200,time will tell a few months is not a very long history sample size,"thanks for the excellent summary

if there are any newbies reading this threat and licking their lips and hoping for similar returns pls be very careful 

i sense that for every  carter then must be  others who tried the same strategy but blew their account but we never hear of them

carter basically sold credit spreads and given his  return in  years hes obviously taking a ton of risk on each trade

going forward he may find his returns are not so good cos his account is now larger and his emotions will change when hes playing with much larger amounts on the line its easier to double  than it is to double k","bullshit story nobody turned  into  from selling volatility 

the story would have been believable if the kid had  and turned it into more from selling optionsbut this story is so absurd that it can be dismissed outright

the only people turning  into tens of thousands of dollars are degenerates like me who buy short dated options and ride gamma and vega to valhalla

i sell options too but selling options is the classic takes money to make money story and its slow and steady selling options will never deliver outsized gains

great summary breakdown i just hate bullshit artists with bullshit stories especially when they arent even believable to anyone except the most gullible or inexperienced

take tastytrade with a heaping amount of salt too they do stuff like this to sell their tastyworks platform and options selling is for everyone narrative"
trading strategy,options,Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 12 - Monetizing the Level of Implied Volatility (Big Brain Trading Strategy),"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found huge edges by trading how the level of implied volatility changes this post explains how 

 example i sold some of the january straddles on rivn when they released options this week at around  iv its now at  



i was able to capture  vegas in  day

this could have gone the other way but a lot of work went into pricing the fair value of iv here actually have it much lower than where it is now and in this lesson i will go into how to think about trading implied volatility levels and price it out for yourself

 most traders only think about trading implied volatility vs realized volatility

or what we might refer to as theta gang strategies but there is a whole world of opportunity out there to be explored by trading how the actual implied volatility number changes for options

 this post will go in depth on how to trade the level of implied volatility and how the pnl for it works

the reason i bring this up is that i have spent some time looking into mispriced options in longer dated options and i think there is lots of edge to be found there but in order to take advantage of this we need to understand how to price and trade the level of implied volatility

note these are advanced trades theres good returns to be made but it can be absolutely brutal if you are on the wrong side having a strong thesis and good position management are a must

 its all about that vega baby

trading is all about finding where you disagree with the market and then expressing your view on that disagreement correctly

if we are going to be trading the level of implied volatility we need to make sure we are exposed to change in the level of implied volatility

options off the bat are sensitive to this through one of the greeks called vega vega is the change in the option price for a  point change in implied volatility

for example if implied volatility went from  to  vega tells us how that would impact the price of the option we are looking at if our vega was  the position would change in value by 

 what options are most sensitive to vega

the primary way to get a lot of vega exposure is to go further out in time

when go very far out in time you have very little gamma and therefore very little theta the primary exposure is vega which creates a somewhat linear trade

 for example here is the greeks for a jan  straddle on spy

xb



as you can see we have very little sensitivity  to delta gamma theta but an unbelievably bigger sensitivity to vega this is why we consider these to be linear trades for the most part the pnl really moves up or down with changes in implied volatility 

what about nearer dated options  lets take a look at a straddle on spy that expires this week 

xb



when we reduce the time to expiration vega is much less impactful as you can see when we are expiring soon gamma and theta run the show primarily

in either situation if implied volatility goes up you are going to make your vega  if implied volatility goes down you are going to lose your vega  so when trying to monetize implied volatility dislocations looking further out in time is a good idea

 a slightly gruesome analogy to understand vega vs theta trading

imagine a person who finds out that they have  day to live they are going to expire in one day what happens in that one day before expiry means a lot to them if they have a bad day it would be devastating and good day would be euphoric

it makes sense they need to maximize on today the outcome of this day is definitive of the quality of their life

now imagine another person who has  years left to live

all of a sudden what happens today isnt such a big deal theres lots of days left so if today was mediocre its not the end of the world so what does this person focus on whats really important to how they feel and the trajectory of their life its their outlook on their future and what they see for down the road

 just like the person with  day to live shorter dated options are really sensitive to things that happen today a lot of theta a lot of gamma

on further dated options just like the person with  years left to live its more so the outlook on the future that matters if your option expires in  years its ok for the most part if the stock moves above its average daily move today  but if all of a sudden the future of the business goes from stable to uncertain the value of your options will change drastically the reason it will change drastically is because theres lots of vega or exposure to a change implied volatility

there is money to be made where the level of implied volatility is different than what we think it should be

 is there money to be made trading the longer dated options

a lot of people think you cant make a lot of money trading longer dated options so people will maybe buy leaps and sell covered calls against them since the leap is not very sensitive to volatility but as i hope you are starting to see this can not be further from the truth

for example lets take a look at a trade that was shared with me on arkx

when it became optionable this year a friend of mine shared some research on the longer dated options that was really interesting the  year options were trading at  implied volatility and our conclusion was that they were worth  implied volatility  over the next couple months it came all the way down a  point drop in implied volatility

xb



so the question is how profitable was the trade

here is what the position looked like at inception take a look at our greeks as you can see

xb



heres what it looked like at the end

xb



 the options basically got cut in half

because of the nature of this trade and the confidence in the research myself and the others i know in this position were able to scale up pretty big 

xb



 what was really interesting is how wrong the markets pricing was

as we go further out in time there tends to be less liquidity on some of these names when you go further out theres just less eyes on it that means opportunity

for example on rivn myself and the others i was looking at this trade with basically made up all of the longer dated volume early on tuesday 

because of how poorly it was being priced and the thoroughness of the research we did i was able to scale up on this position significantly iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found that theres actually a lot of opportunity like arkx that comes around so now lets discuss a couple of basic ways to price these out and find these opportunities

 idea generation

something that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) noticed is when realized volatility spikes in the near term sometimes the whole term structure will elevate and the back can get really out of line

so i typically look for these types of trades when bad news has come out around a stock industry or sector

examples of times that i have traded this way

 when archegos blew up longer dated vols on the companies that were held by the fund stayed elevated post event
 arkx release options were pretty illiquid and very poorly priced anticipating a lot more volatility than it should have given the underlying stocks
 tsla longer dated options were being priced at extremely high levels given the size of the company and relative to correlated assets
 kweb pricing in extremely high volatility higher than covid because of chinese market issues
 rivn starting to release options and pricing them at insane levels of implied volatility

 how to price the level of implied volatility Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) example

in order to explain how to go about pricing the level of implied volatility i am going to go through a trade that i took earlier this year on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA)

keep in mind that this is the sentence we are trying to complete the market is showing me that the stock is trading at an implied volatility of x i think the level of implied vol should be y

 the situation

earlier this year when the archegos fund blew up the stocks that it was holding took a massive hit simply put they got crushed this lead to a massive opportunity that was missed by much of the retail community the options market went berserk 

before the fund blew up the fair value for options were around  iv 

but when everything exploded the crazy movement in the short term caused the whole option chain to lift up all of a sudden the  day and  day options were trading at  iv

for perspective iv was at  during covid for the same DTE Energy Company (DTE)

basically things look really crazy so i set out to price the options and try to uncover a trade

 there are two ways to price the options here absolute value and relative value lets go over each way for Discovery Holding Co (DISCA)

  example of absolute value pricing

absolute value pricing involves comparing what we are seeing today for a stock against what we have seen in the past 

Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) july options were trading at  iv before the archegos liquidation as the event happened implied volatility shot up to  a couple days later when the event was over it was still at  iv 

xb



thinking about how options are priced it would make sense that the level of implied volatility came down here since the impact from the event had happened already assuming there were no further chain reactions and therefore the level of implied vol should come back down to what it was preevent or 

the reason i didt think there would be chain reactions is that the realized volatility basically stopped after the event check this out

xb



 with a normal implied volatility of  the event over and rv returning to normal it seemed reasonable to expect the iv to come back down to the  range

  example of relative value pricing

relative value pricing is an extremely powerful way to price options it involves comparing the options for a stock we are interested in against other stocks that are correlated 

for example ko and pep are strongly correlated they have similar levels of implied volatility take a look at this pic

xb



the above picture is showing  blue  pep  day iv green  ko  day iv bottom green  ratio between ko and pep  day iv

as you can see they move together when ko vol goes up so does pep

looking at the ratio you can see they have an average ratio between them that they mean revert around this is because they have correlated movements and implied volatilities when the spread between them gets too large we see it close 

now imagine we saw this

xb



the red line is a hypothetical situation where the ratio between them shot up

in this situation we could also say that there is an opportunity to trade the level of implied volatility for these companies

we could buy vol on the lower iv one sell vol on the higher one or we could look for which leg is inefficient and likely to change the most and just trade that one

 so how did i use relative value pricing to trade Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) 

first i went out to find a correlated stock the one i settled on was foxa then i plotted the ivs for each of them and looked at the ratio 

xb



as you can see at the time of the disaster the iv went through the roof since foxa was not a part of the disaster it was clear that it wasnt really an industry impacting event and that when the disaster is over the volatility should return to something back in line with this correlation 

 with an average ratio of about  and foxa trading at around  iv it seemed reasonable that we should see Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) volatility come back to around    iv

my analysis on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) painted a very clear picture of what should happen to the options after the event because i had done enough leg work to develop a good thesis i was able to pack on some size and make a fantastic return 

 both my absolute value and relative value narrowed down on a similar fair value for implied volatility on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) between  and 

from here i went and sold july straddles on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) and sure enough the iv came down to my expected fair value and i was able to pay for a nice vacation  

i closed out this position when it was pretty much at my fair value 

on the flip side if this trade had gone against me i would have to go back to the drawing board and really dig into my thesis holding these types of positions through iv spikes can be catastrophic if you are wrong so a lot of work would have to go into why its moving against me 

on a couple other positions it has moved against me in the short term but then i have been right in the end of the day weathering those storms is no joke though especially if you have a meaningful amount of money on the line this is why i always stress the importance of knowing your stuff before scaling up your trades

 conclusion

by knowing how to price the level of implied volatility you can develop really strong ideas that can yield great returns this has been one of my primary strategies this year especially with the meme stock craze tensions in china etc 

 important point

this is not about just selling high iv a lot of the times iv is high for a reason this is about pricing iv and selling when it is expensive

a lot of traders make the mistake of selling because its high but i hope this post helps you think different about volatility and gives you some ideas about where you can find a real edge in the market 

remember once you have an idea of where iv should be you can make a trade if its different than what the market is pricing

trading strategy,options,ULTIMATE Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 4 (Finding a Edge and Building a Trading Strategy),"in this post i go into detail on  what a trading edge looks like  how to build a strategy  an example of executing a strategy 

this post is a bit trickier than some of the others i have made and will make in the future but dont let that discourage you 

trading is a competition in the end of the day it attracts very smart people to play and theres no free lunch ill be around to answer questions so please ask if you have any

previous parts of this series     read these and it will hopefully lay some groundwork for this post

 it all starts with idea generation

this is where i find a lot of people struggle but it should actually be one of the easiest parts of strategy development 

for you to have a profitable system you just need to be better than the next guy it doesnt need to be super fancy or complicated 

think about it like you are an electrician in your local town currently theres some guy making all the money for fixes in the area if you can find some sort of advantage now youll be the guy making all the money maybe you can get jobs done faster maybe you sell better maybe your price is lower 

note an idea alone is worthless just like in business ideas dont make money execution is what makes money 

note your idea cant be too general it cant just be i want to sell options it needs to be more specific with that being said it doesnt need to be something super complex 

at this point we are just deciding on something we want to investigate 

examples of good things to explore

 is the implied variance risk premium higher on etfs than stocks
 where is the variance risk premium the highest across us equities
 is selling vol on tech stocks and buying vol on finance a good pairs trade
 can we forecast earnings straddle pnls

 a trading edge has distinct characteristics

below is a list of different things that can lead to an edge in the market i share these to spark some ideas so that you can think about where you should look for an edge given your unique situation

xb

 data access do you have access to better data that no one else does example imagine the number of species in the marianas trench could predict tomorrows spy price well no one has that data so if you did you would have more knowledge than everyone else and youd make the most money 
 skillsets if you are competing in a very low capacity space where there is lots of individuals and not so many teams having strong data science skills pull in data manipulate and transform the data  could give you an edge and help you build your trading business 
 your network do you have access to people who can give you good ideas example private equity deals  having a network of professional traders to collab with etc 
 specialization if you are a corporate lawyer can you figure out ma deals better than the next guy if you work in small cap tech can you figure out software development cycles and product release dates better than the next guy are you a doctor who understands biotech better than the next guy
 geography you can only trade certain products when you live in certain places this also incorporates regulatory issues too 
 being first to an idea i guess this is the reinventing the wheel point this is a pretty competitive route to take but for example when new products are released no body really knows how to price it efficiently so there is room for you to come in and take a stab at pricing it better than the next guy 
 liquidity constraints using your capital size to your advantage warren buffett once said if he had a million dollars he could do  a year and that is because he could take the same ideas he uses and use them on lower cap stocks which are less efficiently priced so where can we go that the big players cant dont try to find food in the ocean find a pond with lots of small fish 
 high barrier to entry due to infrastructure we cant really just go and start a high frequency trading firm the infrastructure for this is insane so if you have it you could have an edge 
 risk tolerance do we have a higher risk tolerance than the next guy and can therefore take trades  with more pnl variance that others maybe avoid cant take example a volatility hedge fund might not want to deploy a strategy with  daily swings even if the expected value is huge 

those are some characteristics of a good edge idea and hopefully it gives you some ideas 

in another post i will go into my strategy for earnings trading as a follow up example to this the reason i am exploring earnings is because there is a lot of retail interest its tricky to model well and theres likely to be a variance risk premium 

 building your strategy

  pick what you are trying to predictforecast 

something really important to note is that whenever you are placing a trade it is your opinion vs the market there is somebody on the other side of your trade taking on the opposite view of you 

since we are trading our ideas against the market it means we are expressing a disagreement with the markets view on things so whether we know it or not we have some sort of forecast or predicting on how things should be priced being conscious about what we are trying to predict is very important 

for example if we are trading earnings volatility what we might be trying to predict is the straddle pnl and if we can identify when they are cheapexpensive we can build a strategy 

what we are trying to predict is referred to as your target variable 

 not why but whether

once we have an idea or something we want to forecast we dont want to ask why does this exist we start by asking whether this exists 

so many retail traders fall into this trap they say this sounds like a good idea because of a b and c reasons im going to trade it 

but we cant ask why it exists until we confirm whether it does 

this part usually requires some pretty serious data science skills a workaround for retail is to look at academic papers for ideas or surround yourself with people who have the skills 

a good place to research is 

 what should we try to predict

what we try to predict is important heres an example to illustrate 

its hard to predict the score between west ham and manchester united  an ok team and an allstar team but its not so difficult to predict who the winner is likely to be 

so for our trading sometimes we dont need to be trying to forecast the exact move we can start by just focusing on the bias

so from a basic perspective if we are trying to forecast whether a stock has an inflated risk premium in its options they are expensive we can look at some data points that help us predict cheapexpensive a fair value on volatility and a reason for it but then in our execution we can be less married to our fair value target price and trade the cheapexpensive bias more consistently 

  determine the factors that help us with our prediction

imagine you are trying to predict the amount of horsepower that a car has in your model the target variable would be horsepower but what can help us predict horsepower

 whether the car is a v or v
 the colour of the car
 rear front or all wheel drive
 number of doors

lets say we determine that the  points above are good indicators of a cars horsepower these would then become our predictor variables 

you can think of predictor variables as the checklist of things we go over when trying to make a conclusion about our target variable 

example if a car has a v engine red paint rear wheel drive and  doors its probably over Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) 

 consulting the data

if you want to be able to do this on a professional level you will need to develop your data science skills being able to work with and manipulate data is the equivalent of knowing how to type in the professional space its not an edge but its basically expected that you know it 

in the retail space most of us here its a nice to have and not a need to have so yes knowing it can be an advantage but its not a necessity 

i will focus on how to do this with no coding background unless enough traders want to see the other part 

 an example of trading a strategy being implemented

note a lot of you ask what tools i use a lot of the base data points and scans that i rely on are from predicting alpha i then use think or swim to stress and analyze positions i execute trades in interactive brokers 

the reason i use these platforms is they a provide me with analytics tools that ease the burden of needing data science skills b let me analyze my positions in depth before putting them on c offer me the best commissions and execution on my trades

for this strategy i am sharing in this example i am trading the difference between the implied and realized volatilities for us equities because of the variance risk premium and increased retail interest i aim to build out a model that helps me identify overpriced options

 lets start by defining my target and predictor variables

 target variable realized volatility over the next  days for a stock

 predictor variables current realized volatility last  days current implied volatility  day current future forecast of volatility  day current ivdrvd spread

through my own research and things iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned the set of predictor variables i listed above are good at telling me about what realized volatility will look like over next  days

for each of those factors i am trying to determine if they are high or low relative to the historic metrics except for the volatility forecast which is something a bit different basically a statistical forecast of the future 

beyond each of these factors i will look at the news to add a more qualitative component to my analysis i want to understand why i am seeing what i do 

  start with a scan

i started by running a scan for a stock that had some liquidity and an iv  forecast by at least x i also added a filter for iv to get rid of stocks that werent implying much to happen

the reason i do this is that the market has way too many things to look at and its efficient to use a scanner to filter from s of equities down to a shortlist of things that meet a base criteria for your strategy 



xb

by doing so i generated a list of  stocks to look at given the time of year most of these stocks have earnings around  days from now so i had to be careful to avoid ones with big earnings moves priced in since i am really trying to trade the non event volatility most of these stocks have a bit of earnings vol priced in on the DTE Energy Company (DTE) options

the stock i chose for this analysis is grpn groupon 

  evaluate your predictor variables

iv rv and forecast  analysis

iv  

rv  

fv  

iv is over x fv this is my expensive indicator for the fv predictor variable

off the bat this is looking good iv much higher than rv and forecast this is usually a strong sign for sell options

to move on lets plot the historic iv and rv to see how they are moving relative to each other 



if we plot the historic iv and rv we can see that for the last while there has been a consistent premium of iv over rv this is my expensive indicator for iv and rv

one cause for concern we can see that iv has continued to rise despite the lower realized volatility which means that someone is still a buyer at these levels and could be a slight cause for concern i would definitely want to do somme digging into the company to see whats happening around it and try to hypothesize about who could be buying here 

one last point we will look at here is if this ratio between iv and rv is normal or if its at an extreme 

as i described in a previous  think of iv and rv as being in a dance together they take turns leading the dance but they try to stay in step with each other

so looking at how they move together we usually see it mean reverts around a comfortable spread between the two if one strays too far from the other they move closer together if they move too close together they push further apart

 here is the iv  rv ratio for grpn over the last year



as we can see the ivrv spread is towards the top of the range meaning they are far apart right now so we can expect either rv to pick up or iv to come down or them to meet in the middle theres other combinations of possibilities but lets keep it simple

if we look back at the first graph we see that rv has remained the same while iv has been moving up so i could conclude that perhaps it will meet somewhere in the middle iv comes down a bit rv goes up a bit but below the current iv line this is my expensive indicator for ivrv ratio predictor variable

 if we look at all the variables they check the boxes for the realized volatility to be lower than the implied aka iv is expensive 

now as mentioned theres some qualitative research into the news sentiment whos trading this to really build some qualitative confidence too but assuming that checks out i would be selling options here

 from here i would put on a trade that properly express my view that volatility is expensive maybe a straddle 

i will go more in depth on structuring and managing trades in a later post its a whole topic on its own

 these are the basics of good strategy development and finding an edge in trading 

i hope that this post has given you some ideas and insights into the world of profitable trading it might seem like over kill but i promise that i do not go out of my way to to make things complicated we actually want things to be as simple as can be while still being profitable 

an important thing to note is that you can actually do all of this work and still lose money trading its a tough game we need to always be improving looking for new ideas always on the hunt for that better edge 

 if you found this post valuable please upvote it as that gives me ideas about what i should write about in my next post 

happy trading everyone

AGCO Corporation (AG)",556,havent read your post yet but honestly thank you for these post i will read later,"am finding that my edge is

 having patient capital no itch to buy or sell until the right opp comes along
 long term horizon i can hold  yrs easy
 never borrow on margin i can stomach correction w zero pressure to sell","i think youre missing one thing in your list of categories for an edge which is industry knowledge  im extremely techheavy in my portfolio and have been for years however iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) made some huge gains by getting in to companies early on because i work in tech so i know it better than most people  i know why aws is winning in the cloud space because i use it every day  i can usually tell if a tech company is going to be successful longterm based on their products too  for example i saw a demo of ddogs product at a conference before they even went public and i could tell instantly that this thing was pure gold since it could answer questions that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) struggled with solving for the previous  years of my career and was even capable of doing something in the security field not their intended purpose that i had only theorized was possible but i knew would be invaluable once everyone else realized this i pointed it out to the guy doing the demo as well and the use case had never even occurred to him  i know what brands of cpus my peers at other similar companies are buying for their highperformance computing clusters and why plus the drives networking gizmos etc and theres a reason that im jacked almost to the tits about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) going forward along with a few other companies  finally if hashicorp ever goes public i will you only live once that shit so hard that even wsb will be impressed because their products are some of the best that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) ever used and i think almost everyone in the industry would probably agree with me  


now some of this probably falls under network as you mentioned since i certainly leverage the opinions of my peers in tech when making some of these decisions  however trading companies in an industry that you intimately understand is definitely an edge and has served me well for a very long time  sure there are big firms out there that will do their E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) and have quants with decades of experience to actually do it but even then the quants are going to ask people like me about a companys products and i can guarantee that one of their quants wouldnt be able to look at ddog and have their eyes light up during their demo because they can finally give me a solution that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) wished i had for the previous  years  i realize that im also glossing over things like revenue and how a company is run overall here and in reality i can still take those things into account to a certain extent  its not too hard to look at a smaller tech company and determine if theyre going to crash and burn because they cant run a company  i cant tell if theyll succeed in general but i can definitely tell if they wont based on how they run their dev process this seems like it would be difficult to determine but in reality iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found that i can usually make a pretty good guess and iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) never been wrong before so i think that along with the usefulness of their offerings is enough to make a pretty good case in terms of fundamentals"
