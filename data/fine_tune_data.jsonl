mentioned in at least one comment seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct  it just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far  always keep that in mind\n\ni tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as i got notifications on my phone  just as a heads up i wont

pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a lowvolume vacuum  the most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open  tons of volume to push the price down then a

short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples money  my sentiment analysis kpis thus indicate im likely striking a healthy balance laugh out loud\n\n the game theory\n\nok but seriously is this situation a pump and dump\n\npossibly\n\ni say possibly because as i stated in a comment a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier  even worse in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side  not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the startits just what ends up happening if the campaign fails\n\nok so failure aside what are the dynamics of the trade  what kind of game is this\n\nin simplified terms id describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified  where the winning side also takes the losing sides bid money  in other words at an aggregate level its winner take all go hard or go home with all the excitement of market action in the middle  note that i said in aggregate and with market action in the middle as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end  as i mentioned in some comments where i urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money this is going to be a whiteknuckle trade to the very end\n\n power\n\nfor most of our lives most of the time the saying that information is power and the closely related knowledge is power are abstract philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy  more tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be money is power or for the least fortunate the threat and reality of physical force\n\ntoday for many in the gme trade that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance  what is current si  can you trust numbers from s  what about ortex  are there counterfeit shares in play  what is the significance of failures to deliver can the short side cover their position off the exchange etc etc\n\nbeing in this situation if nothing else has lifted the veil for many people  the right information in the right circumstances is incredibly powerful  it outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry\n\nif you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated  most of all try to avoid developing a  at all costs  if nothing else in my opinion its critical for your longterm financial success\n\ni dont know the answer to those questions definitively and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything i write  in fact it would make me happier if i see people use some of the tools techniques and concepts ive tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking  catching my mistakes helps me  doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone\n\n faith conviction calculated risk\n\nmany people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies\n\nsome people including those that most wall street types consider to be responsible investors invest on blind faith  you put your capital is someone elses hands hopefully a qualified fiduciary and trust that they will do a good job  the only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the persons in which to place your faith  this is not entirely unlike what many wsbettors are doing with respect to dfv  i do this with my retirement accounts though lately ive been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a selfdirected ira\n\nothers trade on conviction  they have for whatever reason a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light  i consider value investors to fall into this category\n\nothers are momentum traders and technical analysts who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity  these opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis  all that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk\n\ni think its healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches  i personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches midtrade  ie if you started in the gme trade on faith it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the nomans land between faith and conviction where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out  im not saying you shouldnt try to make that transitionjust try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions\n\n swimming in the deep\n\nso the consistent  question i always get what happens next  my consistent answer which i know frustrates everyone is i dont know and no one else does either\n\none person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth which some may find disturbing is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the drivers seat  this may very well be true  i would give it better than even odds at this point  in fact even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade retail is not a wellorganized monolithic entity and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times\n\nanother question i got which was a very good one to be asking is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side  for me there have been critical actions over the past few days that i would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors such as the sustained hft duel into the close on friday  that was very consistent relatively well controlled and sustained push on volume of mio shares traded in the   share price range  oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of bn in capital flow  that is not retailparticularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time  the mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze and ortex reported reduction in short interest is also definitely not retail  others have pointed out massive action in the options today  tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high  figures  not retail\n\nall of that being said does that really change very much  even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows i do which is why im writing these posts and holding that core position in the end you are trading as an individual  this is a point that i have made repeatedly  in the end you need to know yourself know your trade and have a plan  your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else i know many are following dfv to whatever the end may be but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual\n\nif my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes and price grinding down to a floor of harder support possibly even at the retail line of support  i outlined in a prior post  there may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract t settlement impact  i dont know enough about what to expect there  if the squeeze is to happen unless rh lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while maybe days maybe longer until sufficient liquid float has been locked up\n\nright now options action is heavily weighted to puts so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price\n\nif the squeeze fails to happen there wont be a siren ringing of a bell or anything like that  it might happen gradually and nonobviously until suddenly as only the market seems to be able to do it becomes obvious that whoevers still there has been left holding the bag  hopefully this isnt the case but if it is ill be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car laugh out loud\n\nif it succeeds it should be fairly obvious  just dont forget to ring the register\n\neither way this is market history in the making  as i said in a previous comment when you ride the rocket its definitely not going to be smoothbut it might just be awesome\n\napologies for the lengthy post again  good luck in the market", "completion": "i have a question while i wait to read this post this may be a stupid question im a long term investor and never pay attention to stuff like this so if im understanding the situation here correctly reported si is down

aside what are the dynamics of the trade  what kind of game is this\n\nin simplified terms id describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified  where the winning side also takes the losing sides bid money  in other words at an aggregate level its winner take all go hard or go home with all the excitement of market action in the middle  note that i said in aggregate and with market action in the middle as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end  as i mentioned in some comments where i urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money this is going to be a whiteknuckle trade to the very end\n\n power\n\nfor most of our lives most of the time the saying that information is power and the closely related knowledge is power are abstract philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy  more tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be money is power or for the least fortunate the threat and reality of physical force\n\ntoday for many in the gme trade that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance  what is current si  can you trust numbers from s  what about ortex  are there counterfeit shares in play  what is the significance of failures to deliver can the short side cover their position off the exchange etc etc\n\nbeing in this situation if nothing else has lifted the veil for many people  the right information in the right circumstances is incredibly powerful  it outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry\n\nif you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated  most of all try to avoid developing a  at all costs  if nothing else in my opinion its critical for your longterm financial success\n\ni dont know the answer to those questions definitively and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything i write  in fact it would make me happier if i see people use some of the tools techniques and concepts ive tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking  catching my mistakes helps me  doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone\n\n faith conviction calculated risk\n\nmany people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies\n\nsome people including those that most wall street types consider to be responsible investors invest on blind faith  you put your capital is someone elses hands hopefully a qualified fiduciary and trust that they will do a good job  the only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the persons in which to place your faith  this is not entirely unlike what many wsbettors are doing with respect to dfv  i do this with my retirement accounts though lately ive been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a selfdirected ira\n\nothers trade on conviction  they have for whatever reason a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light  i consider value investors to fall into this category\n\nothers are momentum traders and technical analysts who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity  these opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis  all that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk\n\ni think its healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches  i personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches midtrade  ie if you started in the gme trade on faith it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the nomans land between faith and conviction where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out  im not saying you shouldnt try to make that transitionjust try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions\n\n swimming in the deep\n\nso the consistent  question i always get what happens next  my consistent answer which i know frustrates everyone is i dont know and no one else does either\n\none person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth which some may find disturbing is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the drivers seat  this may very well be true  i would give it better than even odds at this point  in fact even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade retail is not a wellorganized monolithic entity and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times\n\nanother question i got which was a very good one to be asking is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side  for me there have been critical actions over the past few days that i would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors such as the sustained hft duel into the close on friday  that was very consistent relatively well controlled and sustained push on volume of mio shares traded in the   share price range  oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of bn in capital flow  that is not retailparticularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time  the mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze and ortex reported reduction in short interest is also definitely not retail  others have pointed out massive action in the options today  tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high  figures  not retail\n\nall of that being said does that really change very much  even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows i do which is why im writing these posts and holding that core position in the end you are trading as an individual  this is a point that i have made repeatedly  in the end you need to know yourself know your trade and have a plan  your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else i know many are following dfv to whatever the end may be but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual\n\nif my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes and price grinding down to a floor of harder support possibly even at the retail line of support  i outlined in a prior post  there may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract t settlement impact  i dont know enough about what to expect there  if the squeeze is to happen unless rh lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while maybe days maybe longer until sufficient liquid float has been locked up\n\nright now options action is heavily weighted to puts so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price\n\nif the squeeze fails to happen there wont be a siren ringing of a bell or anything like that  it might happen gradually and nonobviously until suddenly as only the market seems to be able to do it becomes obvious that whoevers still there has been left holding the bag  hopefully this isnt the case but if it is ill be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car laugh out loud\n\nif it succeeds it should be fairly obvious  just dont forget to ring the register\n\neither way this is market history in the making  as i said in a previous comment when you ride the rocket its definitely not going to be smoothbut it might just be awesome\n\napologies for the lengthy post again  good luck in the market", "completion": "as usual im late to

limitations to the analysis\n\na tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis both of these would adversely affect the overall returns\n\nb since i am only using the monthly data for the pe ratio and my spy investments due to data constraints a much more complicated strategy involving intramonth price changes might have a better chance of beating the market at the same time making it more difficult to execute\n\nc while we have analyzed the trends using the last  years worth of spy data the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say   or even  years\n\n \n\nconclusion\n\ni started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month i also checked for various time frames   years and various endpoints just before the covid crash after the crash before jpow etc in none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average joe in the total returns\n\nsince this is an optimization problem i am  in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive riskadjusted marketbeating returns\n\n \n\nfootnotes\n\n the data was obtained from yahoo finance api and longtermtrendsnet while the pe ratio was available for the last  years the daily closing of spy was limited to  years\n\n we are using the shiller pe ratio  this ratio divides the price of the sp  index by the average inflationadjusted earnings of the previous  years this solves for the brief period in  when the normal pe ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis\n\n we are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the tbonds\n\n the  cutoff is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends\n\n the idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from jp morgan which stated that  of the best days in the market happened within  days of the worst ones", "completion": "a key takeaway while some strategy may be superior to the average joe in certain conditions anyone who is just starting out should be primarily concerned about simply getting in to the market the big

{"prompt": "by now we have all heard the virtues of dollarcost averaging dca and that you should never try to time the market basically it has been repeated ad nauseam that\n\ntime in the market beats timing the market\n\nbut what is interesting is that i could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollarcost averaging\n\ntheoretically there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hardearned money once a month into spy right\n\nso in this weeks analysis we will explore various methods to do dca and see which one would end up giving you the best returns\n\n

investment styles all of them would be investing the same amount   every month but following different strategies\n\naverage joe invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending this would be our benchmark\n\ncautious charlie invests in the market only if the price to earnings ratio  is lesser than the last year rolling average else will hold treasurybills

certain percentage from the last alltime high else will hold tbills \n\ngiven that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment i have considered the starting point to be st jan  so the analysis is based on someone who invested  every month since  in all the above strategies we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied ie in the case of cautious charlie he will keep on accumulating tbills every month if the pe ratio is not within his set limit once its below the limit he will convert all the tbills and invest them into spy

{"prompt": "post a example of trades short puts covered calls and verticals\n\n\n\n\n\nin parts  and  i explained the basics for options in parts  and  i explained simple and more advanced options strategies but all of this does not help much without concrete examples these two last posts a and  conclude my introduction related to options i will show some of my key trades explaining the why the how the entries and exits and potential mitigations in case of losses most gave great returns and i had a few small losses overall in the past few months i have been lucky to play along with the market and the high volatility had a positive impact hopefully nothing rwsb worthy although few of them might qualify  i wanted to explain the basics first then show the trades last as i did not want anyone to try to emulate these without understanding howwhy they worked\n\nfirst here are the highlevel idioms that drive my investments\n\n over time the market is going up\n it can fall down violently or it can jump high without obvious signs ahead of time\n when the market goes down it will go back up over time and that can be very quick\n a single stock will be more volatile than the markets and can go up or down even more violently and unlike the market if it goes down there is no guarantee it will ever go back up\n after a significant market move the market often but not always reverts to the mean\n\nthese idioms are pretty straightforward and should not be too controversial overall i am pretty market neutral with a bullish tint  and as i explained before i prefer selling options than buying them my trades reflect that and i avoid making trades that could damage my portfolio significantly if the market went up or down significantly people who get ruined with options do not take this into account and are just gambling\n\nother key things about trading in general and options in particular\n\n always have a clear idea of your max profit and your max loss and the probability of that to happen failing to understand this means that you will take more risk than anticipated and one day you could blow up your account and get ruined\n keep your trades small dont have a sure thing trade that risks  or more of your portfolio dont cripple your portfolio because of one bad trade\n dont trade for the sake of trading wait for the conditions to be right then wait a bit more and wait again then when things look the best then trade on your own terms do not get sucked into gambling with a poor profitrisk profile\n watch out for your leverage it can be very easy to take too many risks and use too much of your buying power if you mix your bearish and bullish bets you can close one side at a profit to free some buying power and reduce overall risk\n\nnow the moment we have been waiting for some of my trades\n\nthe short naked puts or covered calls\n\ni only do pure covered calls when the market has dropped significantly and use the recent market conditions as a floor march dropped quite hard and i am not convinced that we would reach it again soon but i still have to prepare for it that being said the months of march to june have been really good for covered calls as the market traded up first then sideways with high implied volatility i usually target shares that are solid or did not go up too much so the march floor is not too far lower than my strike i usually sell naked puts after a few down days in a row and covered calls after a few up days in a row and if the market is farther from the floor i trade safer names when the market goes up and target high beta when the market dropped significantly\n\ni am not giving you a full list but lets say that it was not hard and still is to find good names that return  per month after accounting for a  share drop yup you read that right it does not work in normal markets but it is the case right now even if wm wmt intc nnn eww dltr cof bac etc dropped by around  i would gladly pocket my  premium and scoop these at a huge discount even if it dropped further i can continue rolling the puts until the market bounces back some of the high beta names include ccl rem dig bud jets xop etc for a high beta i am targeting  or more of premium but i usually try to offload them when they go up significantly\n\nbut there are few other riskier trades that are worth calling out\n\ndkng  draftking  in  weeks\n\ni forgot about the ipo and got in the game  days later although i am not a gambler and the stock went up already but i had a feeling that rh fams would jump on it gamblers beget gamblers and that would give a floor to the stock volatility was high so selling naked puts made sense\n\nmay  sell  dkng   may   put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nmay  sell  dkng   jun   put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nas you know the max risk of going to  is possible but highly improbable so rorac return on riskadjusted capital is much higher than these  to \n\nthe  premium was one week before expiration i sold the may and june puts at the same time and the price was at  already if the price dropped i would continue rolling my puts until i am profitable the price went up i rolled my may puts just before earnings and a day before expiration to take advantage of the earning volatility and avoiding expiration day\n\nmay  sell  dkng   may  june   put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nso one week later i bought back my may puts for  pocketing already  of the profit and sold the same june contract as the week before with a better price and an overall premium of  same as the week before despite paying back the  and the stock was already up in a week can you believe that shit volatility increase definitely helped thanks rh gamblers\n\njune  buy  dkng   june   put  \n\nafter a bit more than  weeks of holding i decided to buy back all my contracts for  per share for an overall  profit on risk i pretty much reached max profit already no need to take more risk with  days to go to expiration fwiw the stock was at  by expiration it was way too much for my taste with no premium worth the risk of any new trade\n\ncould i have made more profit buying shares calls or synthetic shares sure but there was no guarantee on the direction timing or amplitude of the move here i won almost  with a high probability of success even if the stock barely budged or dropped a bit and since  expiration the stock dropped to  now its hard to predict when to sell i want many singles and doubles with few losses instead of once in a while home runs with many losses in between\n\nas it dropped for  days to  i recently sold some puts for a  strike again\n\njune  sell  dkng   aug   put  \n\nper contract  max risk  max profit   of max risk\n\nbecause the put was deep otm the premium was low the stock will have to drop by more than  for me to start losing money and i can still roll my puts then that seems a good trade wish me luck\n\nyou can see here that you have to look at your max risk your max profit for every trade you are getting into as well as the chance for them to be profitable\n\nuso  dbo  usl  in  months\n\nhere is one that absolutely did not go to plan initially but i was able to turn it around\n\nfirst the trade that led to the disaster\n\napril  sell  may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nremember that uso split  on april  if you want to look at the numbers on  uso was worth  oil kept dropping and dropping for weeks and weeks until that friday where i decided that it was finally a good time to get into oil like a bunch of other suckers the lowest oil price in  years etc my trade could absorb a  loss in uso before i started losing money so it did not feel too risky and i could roll the puts if needed uso rolled all their future contracts earlier that week they were already into may futures yeah contango was a concern but seemed manageable or so i thought\n\nwell except that on monday  oil blew up what was bad became an awful day oil tanked hard because april futures dropped and some people paid to get rid of their contracts tankers started to get full too much oil and not enough space uso dropped to  it was still above my breakeven point of  but the volatility spiked so the value of my short put increased a lot that was some heavy losses why did i go into that trade on friday gosh\n\nthe volatility was so high every oil trader was running around like a headless chicken rh gamblers were taking much heavier losses than mine because they started buying uso long before me oil was going to go back up that was a sure deal right i decided to wait one more day to see how the dust would settle on tuesday uso dropped even more because now it started impacting next months future may tuesday was the april future expiration so trading was all over the place uso dropped to  well below my breakeven point volatility was still high my losses were twice as big there was a strong possibility that may future expiration would behave the same as april and the rollover of may futures to june futures would end up in a real quagmire due to an even higher contango uso was not the right tool i messed up no way moving forward even rolling my puts are not going to do it uso will drop faster than the premium i can collect get out get out get out\n\napril  buy  may    put  \n\ni bought back my short put at more than  times the premium price gulp that hurts\n\ntaking a step back this was an extreme situation and not a normal loss with a stupid long term thesis and i lost a bit of money jumping at the wrong time a negative future price is not a common occurrence\n\nuso was the wrong instrument to profit from oil it even dropped down to  and never recovered its value from  despite oil being higher than that day i made a mistake but there must be better instruments that can tackle contango enters dbo and usl dbo has a  month away contract so very little impact from contango usl has the same number of contracts from all months next month month after next etc until the th month it is mostly impacted by the contango on the front months so for  of the value or a bit more but it is not as volatile as uso uso since changed their composition too to buy multiple months futures\n\noil blew up volatility is extremely high many oil traders and rh gamblers got ruined but oil is bound to go up eventually the initial trade to sell volatility through selling naked puts and rolling as needed until oil goes back up without being killed by the contango still seemed sound with even less risk and better rewards this time around\n\napril  sell  dbo may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\napril  sell  usl may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\napril  sell  dbo may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\napril  sell  usl may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nnotice that i sold the first batch on april  as i was still losing money from uso the volatility spiked and it was too good to pass this is a key reason why you should never put all your money on one trade but only a few percents at most that way if the things are not going as planned you dont lose a ton and if you can find a more advantageous position you can double down if you have some dry powder left but do not overdo it its all about the proper sizing of trades and overall risk i sold the nd batch when i closed my losing uso trade when oil dropped further and volatility increased even more  to  potential profit on at the moment puts just wow\n\nthe plan for the exit is to close for  or roll to the next month for further profit i sized my dbo and usl trades a bit more than my uso trades so i would make up for the heavy losses and i did roll in may and closed the june contracts for  both dbo and usl their prices both creeped up slowly and the volatility dropped to something normal dbo and usl trades were extremely profitable and despite the heavy uso losses the overall profit was still quite good\n\ntoday the price of dbo and usl is a bit high for a good profitrisk profile with naked short puts however we have some other strategies\n\nthe verticals\n\nmost of my bread and butter is on selling naked puts andor selling covered calls but sometimes i dabble in verticals here are some examples\n\nuber  in a month\n\nthis is an example of waiting for the right time before you trade end of may the market went up by  since the bottom it started to be overextended although spy could continue higher it was time to think about a reversion to the mean i needed to find a share that would continue to struggle for a long time even as coronavirus was lingering i hear the news that lyft is taking over ubers market and that uber is still struggling with potential layoffs that seems a good candidate and uber has a good day at  lets see what we can make of the numbers\n\nmay  sell  uber jul    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nso i keep my  profit per contract as long as uber is under  at the july  expiration i did not pick  randomly this was actually above the top that uber reached in february so the struggling uber would need to go over its precorona numbers for me to lose money unlike naked puts  covered calls where you can just be patient and roll over and over sizing for verticals is important the potential for full losses is a real possibility and will happen sure you could try to roll your short call and hope that the stock price will drop but you may just end up amplifying your losses if you really want to do that and continue with the risk its easier to roll your short puts in a bull spread as the market will eventually go up\n\nin any case uber continued to go up a bit struggled at  so not even close to my vertical then reversed i put an order to close my position at  as there was almost a month left until expiration and i already almost reached my max profit\n\njune  buy  uber jul    call  \n\nspy various\n\ni also have been using spy verticals directly as the market bounced back like crazy i earned more than i lost and because i am overall positive delta even if i lose a bit of money on my edges i am still very profitable\n\nfor shit and giggles one trade to show how you can take advantage of the high volatility\n\njune  sell  spy jul    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\njune  buy  spy jul    call  \n\nprofit of  per contract  of max risk\n\njune  spy was   higher than the bottom  months ago and i had hard time believing that after the market really thought that spy would go back to precorona level with still phase  not over no clear treatment vaccine many months away and potential for a nd wave news flash its happening before even the phase finished trees dont grow to the sky again being overall positive delta even if this vertical had a loss i would still profit from spy going over my short calls as i said earlier i am a reversion to the mean guy with a bullish tint i cant stand losing money when the market is going up because the market could always continue going back up\n\nhere is another trade not so good this time so i dont paint an overly rosy picture\n\nmay  sell  spy jun    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\njune  buy  spy jun    call  \n\nouch  loss of  per contract  of max risk\n\nspy blew way past my short and long calls it dropped a bit before expiration so i was able to avoid a full loss\n\nmy verticals above are bearish spreads when i think the market will revert to the mean but here is an example of a bullish spread\n\napril  sell  spy dec    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nmay  buy  spy dec    call  \n\nprofit of  per contract  of max risk\n\ni sold the vertical a couple of weeks after the bottom with blood in the street even some of mine volatility was still very high with this trade i would have lost money if spy was less than  in more than  years heh i could even roll the puts if the short put was still itm in  years the only reason i bought back and closed the trade was that it was using a nonnegligible buying power for the next  years that is a long time to earn the full  per contract have to watch out for opportunity costs too in some other trades\n\nthe hedge\n\nhere is another construct that i found interesting again taking advantage of the current high volatility back in early june as the market bounced to  i wanted another bearish hedge but this time more efficient than just selling a vertical i wanted a good protection for my long delta but thats not free and i dont like to lose money if the hedge is not used so what to do\n\njune  sell  spy nov    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\ni picked november expiration because i expect that we will still be in the middle of the coronavirus quagmire  is almost  higher than the spy top i doubt that the economy will be back full speed by then again i am positive delta so if spy somehow reaches  i may have to forgo all my overall gains between  and  but i wont lose money overall and then i bought this bearish vertical\n\njune  buy  spy nov    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nhere i used the money from my short bearish call spread to buy a long bearish put spread as long as spy does not end above  by expiration my hedge is free if the market drops significantly my bearish put spread will be very profitable\n\nxb\n\nonce again its a long post so thats all for today\n\nin the second  of this post i will show how i used calendars to make some very profitable trades\n\ni will also explain a more advanced trade that i used to hedge against big losses in a normal market setup in low volatility so you can handle more gracefully bear markets ahead of time and not sell in panic you cant use it now but it could be helpful next time everything is great and the market is getting overheated a bit\n\nxb\n\nand finally remember to always size your trades properly do not let one trade create a big loss in your portfolio do not overextend its way too easy to be overleveraged with options take the full risk into consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npost a example of trades short puts covered calls and verticals", "completion": "bow down to you you are god for doing this i have

{"prompt": "post a example of trades short puts covered calls and verticals\n\n\n\n\n\nin parts  and  i explained the basics for options in parts  and  i explained simple and more advanced options strategies but all of this does not help much without concrete examples these two last posts a and  conclude my introduction related to options i will show some of my key trades explaining the why the how the entries and exits and potential mitigations in case of losses most gave great returns and i had a few small losses overall in the past few months i have been lucky to play along with the market and the high volatility had a positive impact hopefully nothing rwsb worthy although few of them might qualify  i wanted to explain the basics first then show the trades last as i did not want anyone to try to emulate these without understanding howwhy they worked\n\nfirst here are the highlevel idioms that drive my investments\n\n over time the market is going up\n it can fall down violently or it can jump high without obvious signs ahead of time\n when the market goes down it will go back up over time and that can be very quick\n a single stock will be more volatile than the markets and can go up or down even more violently and unlike the market if it goes down there is no guarantee it will ever go back up\n after a significant market move the market often but not always reverts to the mean\n\nthese idioms are pretty straightforward and should not be too controversial overall i am pretty market neutral with a bullish tint  and as i explained before i prefer selling options than buying them my trades reflect that and i avoid making trades that could damage my portfolio significantly if the market went up or down significantly people who get ruined with options do not take this into account and are just gambling\n\nother key things about trading in general and options in particular\n\n always have a clear idea of your max profit and your max loss and the probability of that to happen failing to understand this means that you will take more risk than anticipated and one day you could blow up your account and get ruined\n keep your trades small dont have a sure thing trade that risks  or more of your portfolio dont cripple your portfolio because of one bad trade\n dont trade for the sake of trading wait for the conditions to be right then wait a bit more and wait again then when things look the best then trade on your own terms do not get sucked into gambling with a poor profitrisk profile\n watch out for your leverage it can be very easy to take too many risks and use too much of your buying power if you mix your bearish and bullish bets you can close one side at a profit to free some buying power and reduce overall risk\n\nnow the moment we have been waiting for some of my trades\n\nthe short naked puts or covered calls\n\ni only do pure covered calls when the market has dropped significantly and use the recent market conditions as a floor march dropped quite hard and i am not convinced that we would reach it again soon but i still have to prepare for it that being said the months of march to june have been really good for covered calls as the market traded up first then sideways with high implied volatility i usually target shares that are solid or did not go up too much so the march floor is not too far lower than my strike i usually sell naked puts after a few down days in a row and covered calls after a few up days in a row and if the market is farther from the floor i trade safer names when the market

post i will show how i used calendars to make some very profitable trades\n\ni will also explain a more advanced trade that i used to hedge against big losses in a normal market setup in low volatility so you can handle more gracefully bear markets ahead of time and not sell in panic you cant use it now but it could be helpful next time everything is great and the market is getting overheated a bit\n\nxb\n\nand finally remember to always size your trades properly do not let one trade create a big loss in your portfolio do not overextend its way too easy to be overleveraged with

{"prompt": "post a example of trades short puts covered calls and verticals\n\n\n\n\n\nin parts  and  i explained the basics for options in parts  and  i explained simple and more advanced options strategies but all of this does not help much without concrete examples these two last posts a and  conclude my introduction related to options i will show some of my key trades explaining the why the how the entries and exits and potential mitigations in case of losses most gave great returns and i had a few small losses overall in the past few months i have been lucky to play along with the market and the high volatility had a positive impact hopefully nothing rwsb worthy although few of them might qualify  i wanted to explain the basics first then show the trades last as i did not want anyone to try to emulate these without understanding howwhy they worked\n\nfirst here are the highlevel idioms that drive my investments\n\n over time the market is going up\n it can fall down violently or it can jump high without obvious signs ahead of time\n when the market goes down it will go back up over time and that can be very quick\n a single stock will be more volatile than the markets and can go up or down even more violently and unlike the market if it goes down there is no guarantee it will ever go back up\n after a significant market move the market often but not always reverts to the mean\n\nthese idioms are pretty straightforward and should not be too controversial overall i am pretty market neutral with a bullish tint  and as i explained before i prefer selling options than buying them my trades reflect that and i avoid making trades that could damage my portfolio significantly if the market went up or down significantly people who get ruined with options do not take this into account and are just gambling\n\nother key things about trading in general and options in particular\n\n always have a clear idea of your max profit and your max loss and the probability of that to happen failing to understand this means that you will take more risk than anticipated and one day you could blow up your account and get ruined\n keep your trades small dont have a sure thing trade that risks  or more of your portfolio dont cripple your portfolio because of one bad trade\n dont trade for the sake of trading wait for the conditions to be right then wait a bit more and wait again then when things look the best then trade on your own terms do not get sucked into gambling with a poor profitrisk profile\n watch out for your leverage it can be very easy to take too many risks and use too much of your buying power if you mix your bearish and bullish bets you can close one side at a profit to free some buying power and reduce overall risk\n\nnow the moment we have been waiting for some of my trades\n\nthe short naked puts or covered calls\n\ni only do pure covered calls when the market has dropped significantly and use the recent market conditions as a floor march dropped quite hard and i am not convinced that we would reach it again soon but i still have to prepare for it that being said the months of march to june have been really good for covered calls as the market traded up first then sideways with high implied volatility i usually target shares that are solid or did not go up too much so the march floor is not too far lower than my strike i usually sell naked puts after a few down days in a row and covered calls after a few up days in a row and if the market is farther from the floor i trade safer names when the market goes up and target high beta when the market dropped significantly\n\ni am not giving you a full list but lets say that it was not hard and still is to find good names that return  per month after accounting for a  share drop yup you read that right it does not work in normal markets but it is the case right now even if wm wmt intc nnn eww dltr cof bac etc dropped by around  i would gladly pocket my  premium and scoop these at a huge discount even if it dropped further i can continue rolling the puts until the market bounces back some of the high beta names include ccl rem dig bud jets xop etc for a high beta i am targeting  or more of premium but i usually try to offload them when they go up significantly\n\nbut there are few other riskier trades that are worth calling out\n\ndkng  draftking  in  weeks\n\ni forgot about the ipo and got in the game  days later although i am not a gambler and the stock went up already but i had a feeling that rh fams would jump on it gamblers beget gamblers and that would give a floor to the stock volatility was high so selling naked puts made sense\n\nmay  sell  dkng   may   put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nmay  sell  dkng   jun   put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nas you know the max risk of going to  is possible but highly improbable so rorac return on riskadjusted capital is much higher than these  to \n\nthe  premium was one week before expiration i sold the may and june puts at the same time and the price was at  already if the price dropped i would continue rolling my puts until i am profitable the price went up i rolled my may puts just before earnings and a day before expiration to take advantage of the earning volatility and avoiding expiration day\n\nmay  sell  dkng   may  june   put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nso one week later i bought back my may puts for  pocketing already  of the profit and sold the same june contract as the week before with a better price and an overall premium of  same as the week before despite paying back the  and the stock was already up in a week can you believe that shit volatility increase definitely helped thanks rh gamblers\n\njune  buy  dkng   june   put  \n\nafter a bit more than  weeks of holding i decided to buy back all my contracts for  per share for an overall  profit on risk i pretty much reached max profit already no need to take more risk with  days to go to expiration fwiw the stock was at  by expiration it was way too much for my taste with no premium worth the risk of any new trade\n\ncould i have made more profit buying shares calls or synthetic shares sure but there was no guarantee on the direction timing or amplitude of the move here i won almost  with a high probability of success even if the stock barely budged or dropped a bit and since  expiration the stock dropped to  now its hard to predict when to sell i want many singles and doubles with few losses instead of once in a while home runs with many losses in between\n\nas it dropped for  days to  i recently sold some puts for a  strike again\n\njune  sell  dkng   aug   put  \n\nper contract  max risk  max profit   of max risk\n\nbecause the put was deep otm the premium was low the stock will have to drop by more than  for me to start losing money and i can still roll my puts then that seems a good trade wish me luck\n\nyou can see here that you have to look at your max risk your max profit for every trade you are getting into as well as the chance for them to be profitable\n\nuso  dbo  usl  in  months\n\nhere is one that absolutely did not go to plan initially but i was able to turn it around\n\nfirst the trade that led to the disaster\n\napril  sell  may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nremember that uso split  on april  if you want to look at the numbers on  uso was worth  oil kept dropping and dropping for weeks and weeks until that friday where i decided that it was finally a good time to get into oil like a bunch of other suckers the lowest oil price in  years etc my trade could absorb a  loss in uso before i started losing money so it did not feel too risky and i could roll the puts if needed uso rolled all their future contracts earlier that week they were already into may futures yeah contango was a concern but seemed manageable or so i thought\n\nwell except that on monday  oil blew up what was bad became an awful day oil tanked hard because april futures dropped and some people paid to get rid of their contracts tankers started to get full too much oil and not enough space uso dropped to  it was still above my breakeven point of  but the volatility spiked so the value of my short put increased a lot that was some heavy losses why did i go into that trade on friday gosh\n\nthe volatility was so high every oil trader was running around like a headless chicken rh gamblers were taking much heavier losses than mine because they started buying uso long before me oil was going to go back up that was a sure deal right i decided to wait one more day to see how the dust would settle on tuesday uso dropped even more because now it started impacting next months future may tuesday was the april future expiration so trading was all over the place uso dropped to  well below my breakeven point volatility was still high my losses were twice as big there was a strong possibility that may future expiration would behave the same as april and the rollover of may futures to june futures would end up in a real quagmire due to an even higher contango uso was not the right tool i messed up no way moving forward even rolling my puts are not going to do it uso will drop faster than the premium i can collect get out get out get out\n\napril  buy  may    put  \n\ni bought back my short put at more than  times the premium price gulp that hurts\n\ntaking a step back this was an extreme situation and not a normal loss with a stupid long term thesis and i lost a bit of money jumping at the wrong time a negative future price is not a common occurrence\n\nuso was the wrong instrument to profit from oil it even dropped down to  and never recovered its value from  despite oil being higher than that day i made a mistake but there must be better instruments that can tackle contango enters dbo and usl dbo has a  month away contract so very little impact from contango usl has the same number of contracts from all months next month month after next etc until the th month it is mostly impacted by the contango on the front months so for  of the value or a bit more but it is not as volatile as uso uso since changed their composition too to buy multiple months futures\n\noil blew up volatility is extremely high many oil traders and rh gamblers got ruined but oil is bound to go up eventually the initial trade to sell volatility through selling naked puts and rolling as needed until oil goes back up without being killed by the contango still seemed sound with even less risk and better rewards this time around\n\napril  sell  dbo may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\napril  sell  usl may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\napril  sell  dbo may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\napril  sell  usl may    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nnotice that i sold the first batch on april  as i was still losing money from uso the volatility spiked and it was too good to pass this is a key reason why you should never put all your money on one trade but only a few percents at most that way if the things are not going as planned you dont lose a ton and if you can find a more advantageous position you can double down if you have some dry powder left but do not overdo it its all about the proper sizing of trades and overall risk i sold the nd batch when i closed my losing uso trade when oil dropped further and volatility increased even more  to  potential profit on at the moment puts just wow\n\nthe plan for the exit is to close for  or roll to the next month for further profit i sized my dbo and usl trades a bit more than my uso trades so i would make up for the heavy losses and i did roll in may and closed the june contracts for  both dbo and usl their prices both creeped up slowly and the volatility dropped to something normal dbo and usl trades were extremely profitable and despite the heavy uso losses the overall profit was still quite good\n\ntoday the price of dbo and usl is a bit high for a good profitrisk profile with naked short puts however we have some other strategies\n\nthe verticals\n\nmost of my bread and butter is on selling naked puts andor selling covered calls but sometimes i dabble in verticals here are some examples\n\nuber  in a month\n\nthis is an example of waiting for the right time before you trade end of may the market went up by  since the bottom it started to be overextended although spy could continue higher it was time to think about a reversion to the mean i needed to find a share that would continue to struggle for a long time even as coronavirus was lingering i hear the news that lyft is taking over ubers market and that uber is still struggling with potential layoffs that seems a good candidate and uber has a good day at  lets see what we can make of the numbers\n\nmay  sell  uber jul    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nso i keep my  profit per contract as long as uber is under  at the july  expiration i did not pick  randomly this was actually above the top that uber reached in february so the struggling uber would need to go over its precorona numbers for me to lose money unlike naked puts  covered calls where you can just be patient and roll over and over sizing for verticals is important the potential for full losses is a real possibility and will happen sure you could try to roll your short call and hope that the stock price will drop but you may just end up amplifying your losses if you really want to do that and continue with the risk its easier to roll your short puts in a bull spread as the market will eventually go up\n\nin any case uber continued to go up a bit struggled at  so not even close to my vertical then reversed i put an order to close my position at  as there was almost a month left until expiration and i already almost reached my max profit\n\njune  buy  uber jul    call  \n\nspy various\n\ni also have been using spy verticals directly as the market bounced back like crazy i earned more than i lost and because i am overall positive delta even if i lose a bit of money on my edges i am still very profitable\n\nfor shit and giggles one trade to show how you can take advantage of the high volatility\n\njune  sell  spy jul    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\njune  buy  spy jul    call  \n\nprofit of  per contract  of max risk\n\njune  spy was   higher than the bottom  months ago and i had hard time believing that after the market really thought that spy would go back to precorona level with still phase  not over no clear treatment vaccine many months away and potential for a nd wave news flash its happening before even the phase finished trees dont grow to the sky again being overall positive delta even if this vertical had a loss i would still profit from spy going over my short calls as i said earlier i am a reversion to the mean guy with a bullish tint i cant stand losing money when the market is going up because the market could always continue going back up\n\nhere is another trade not so good this time so i dont paint an overly rosy picture\n\nmay  sell  spy jun    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\njune  buy  spy jun    call  \n\nouch  loss of  per contract  of max risk\n\nspy blew way past my short and long calls it dropped a bit before expiration so i was able to avoid a full loss\n\nmy verticals above are bearish spreads when i think the market will revert to the mean but here is an example of a bullish spread\n\napril  sell  spy dec    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nmay  buy  spy dec    call  \n\nprofit of  per contract  of max risk\n\ni sold the vertical a couple of weeks after the bottom with blood in the street even some of mine volatility was still very high with this trade i would have lost money if spy was less than  in more than  years heh i could even roll the puts if the short put was still itm in  years the only reason i bought back and closed the trade was that it was using a nonnegligible buying power for the next  years that is a long time to earn the full  per contract have to watch out for opportunity costs too in some other trades\n\nthe hedge\n\nhere is another construct that i found interesting again taking advantage of the current high volatility back in early june as the market bounced to  i wanted another bearish hedge but this time more efficient than just selling a vertical i wanted a good protection for my long delta but thats not free and i dont like to lose money if the hedge is not used so what to do\n\njune  sell  spy nov    call  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\ni picked november expiration because i expect that we will still be in the middle of the coronavirus quagmire  is almost  higher than the spy top i doubt that the economy will be back full speed by then again i am positive delta so if spy somehow reaches  i may have to forgo all my overall gains between  and  but i wont lose money overall and then i bought this bearish vertical\n\njune  buy  spy nov    put  \n\nper contract  max risk   max profit   of max risk\n\nhere i used the money from my short bearish call spread to buy a long bearish put spread as long as spy does not end above  by expiration my hedge is free if the market drops significantly my bearish put spread will be very profitable\n\nxb\n\nonce again its a long post so thats all for today\n\nin the second  of this post i will show how i used calendars to make some very profitable trades\n\ni will also explain a more advanced trade that i used to hedge against big losses in a normal market setup in low volatility so you can handle more gracefully bear markets ahead of time and not sell in panic you cant use it now but it could be helpful next time everything is great and the market is getting overheated a bit\n\nxb\n\nand finally remember to always size your trades properly do not let one trade create a big loss in your portfolio do not overextend its way too easy to be overleveraged with options take the full risk into consideration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npost a example of trades short puts covered calls and verticals", "completion": "jpowell has pretty much destroyed the put you can

{"prompt": "post  basics call put exercise itm at the moment otm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni wanted to chat a bit about options here i realize that there are already plenty of articles about options that you can find online but many are either overly complex oversimplified trying to sell you some products etc i figured i would explain some of it here in order to reduce the learning barrier after all knowledge is power and given the recent  with robinhood i figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood and dont end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later if you are interested in trading options i invite you to look for more details online\n\ni have been trading options since  i made some mistakes so many especially in the beginning over the years i kinda reduced my option trading activities but these past few months i have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile which helps with my trading style\n\nthis first post is to explain how options work in general the  post will go into some more details the third posts  and  will explain some standard strategies and the fourth posts  and  will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how i approach option investing if you are looking at rwsb style of investment please skip these posts they are not for you i am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles but i will still take some calculated risks so i say  it is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard etfs  mutual funds  real estate so my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth\n\nit is often perceived that options are extremely risky and one of the best ways to get ruined for some trades this can be true to dispel a myth in reality options can also be used to be extremely conservative even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market unlike for shares where you can only control the diversification with options you have a much bigger control on the risk  profit profile time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit or lose from\n\none thing to note is that not all companies or etfs provide options for their shares\n\nthe basics call and put contracts strike and exercise\n\noptions are split into two groups calls and puts both have a strike an expiration date and a number of shares attached to it well talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later when you buy a call or put option you buy a contract with a rd party through your broker and the stock market usually one contract represents  shares\n\nthe strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument so for spy that is worth  today you will have options with strike  but also    etc from  to  options strikes are created as the underlying instrument spy goes up and down for spy strikes have a granularity of  around the share price but can also be  or even  farther from the current price some other instruments have a   or even  granularity it can even have a  granularity hello hertz it dropped so much that the lowest strike is  right now\n\na call is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date if you buy a call with a  strike and the share price went up to reach  this allows you to buy some shares at  that are now worth  the action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call when you exercise your call contract you are buying shares into your account\n\nremember that in most cases  contract will buy  shares in your account when exercising each call contract you will need k of cash in your account in this example  for the strike multiplied by  shares and the same  shares are now worth k at  for each share not accounting for the price you paid for the call option more on this later this means you will make a profit of k if you sell the shares\n\nconversely a put is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date if you bought a put with a  strike and the share price went down to  this allows you to sell some shares at  that are now worth  each similarly to a call the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put\n\nwhen exercising each put contract you are selling  shares from your account when exercising each contract your  shares will be sold for k  for the strike multiplied by  shares and the same  shares are now worth k at  for each share not accounting for the price you paid for the put option this means you made a profit of k if you did not have the  shares per contract in your account you would be actually short selling the shares and you could make the k profit by buying these shares back\n\nin summary a call buys shares when exercising a put sells shares when exercising most importantly in the vast majority of the cases you should actually not exercise your contracts but instead you should sell your call or put at the market price as you will increase your profit see extrinsic value later\n\nbrokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money in other words you cant exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call you want to buy low when the value is high or current value is above the strike for a put you want to sell high when the value is low\n\nmost brokers do autoexercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised if the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date and you did not sell your contracts before they will be worthless and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost\n\nalthough i am mostly talking about american style options that can be exercised at any time there are also european style options that can only be exercised at expiration in the us markets pretty much all stocks and etfs are american style but the cashsettled indexes like spx and rut are european style\n\nthe basics intrinsic and extrinsic value\n\na call or a put contract costs money to buy called a premium so a rd party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put after all they wont take the other side of this contract for free and they have to be remunerated the minimum for a contract is  per share for some very liquid etfs but for most instruments it is  thus  per contract for  shares when you buy a call or put this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date the rd party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses see below\n\nthe value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike on the share price going up and down the shares volatility how fast  far it goes up or down and the time passing\n\nwhen you buy a contract the strike and the expiration date is known however the share price and volatility will constantly change all the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing closer to the expiration date\n\nthe intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price it is above  only when you can exercise the contract the extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time for pretty much all options this extrinsic value is above  and will slowly drop to  as we get closer to the expiration\n\nlets take an example with a share price of \n\nsay you buy a call with a strike of  expiring in a month for  the intrinsic value is     the extrinsic value is     said differently if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date your call contract would bring you  per share you would have lost  due to the time passing\n\nsimilarly you buy a put with a strike of  expiring in a month for  the intrinsic value is     the extrinsic value is    \n\nit is worth noting that any call with a strike price at  or above has  of intrinsic value if you pay  for a  call all the  is extrinsic value if the stock price does not go over  you will lose the full  per share so a  loss per contract similarly a put with a strike price at  or below has  of intrinsic value if you pay  for a  call all the  is extrinsic value your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under \n\nnote that in these examples i use the same price for the call and put options that are  away from the strike price but its not always the case the call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility market expectations potential dividends cost of money etc\n\nthe basics at the moment itm and otm\n\nthere are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls\n\nan option is at the money at the moment when the current share value is matching the strike the share price is  and the strike of  for both the call and put contracts will be considered at the money\n\nan option is in the money itm when the contract has some intrinsic value the share price is  so a call at  is in the money with  of intrinsic value a put at  is in the money with  of intrinsic value too\n\nan option is deep in the money when the option is itm and the strike is far from the current share price for example more than  for example with a share price of  a  call will be considered deep in the money same for a  put\n\nconversely an option is out of the money if there is no intrinsic value with a  share price a  call is out of the money a  put is out of the money the money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value there is no intrinsic value an option is deep out of the money when the option is otm and the strike is far from the

that you can find online but many are either overly complex oversimplified trying to sell you some products etc i figured i would explain some of it here in order to reduce the learning barrier after all knowledge is power and given the recent  with robinhood i figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood and dont end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later if you are interested in trading options i invite you to look for more details online\n\ni have been trading options since  i made some mistakes so many especially in the beginning over the years i kinda reduced my option trading activities but these past few months i have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile which helps with my trading style\n\nthis first post is to explain how options work in general the  post will go into some more details the third posts  and  will explain some standard strategies and the fourth posts  and  will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how i approach option investing if you are looking at rwsb style of investment please skip these posts they are not for you i am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles but i will still take some calculated risks so i say  it is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard etfs  mutual funds  real estate so my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth\n\nit is often perceived that options are extremely risky and one of the best ways to get ruined for some trades this can be true to dispel a myth in reality options can also be used to be extremely conservative even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market unlike for shares where you can only control the diversification with options you have a much bigger control on the risk  profit profile time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit or lose from\n\none thing to note is that not all companies or etfs provide options for their shares\n\nthe basics call and put contracts strike and exercise\n\noptions are split into two groups calls and puts both have a strike an expiration date and a number of shares attached to it well talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later when you buy a call or put option you buy a contract with a rd party through your broker and the stock market usually one contract represents  shares\n\nthe strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument so for spy that is worth  today you will have options with strike  but also    etc from  to  options strikes are created as the underlying instrument spy goes up and down for spy strikes have a granularity of  around the share price but can also be  or even  farther from the current price some other instruments have a   or even  granularity it can even have a  granularity hello hertz it dropped so much that the lowest strike is  right now\n\na call is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date if you buy a call with a  strike and the share price went up to reach  this allows you to buy some shares at  that are now worth  the action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call when you exercise your call contract you are buying shares into your account\n\nremember that in most cases  contract will buy  shares in your account when exercising each call contract you will need k of cash in your account in this example  for the strike multiplied by  shares and the same  shares are now worth k at  for each share not accounting for the price you paid for the call option more on this later this means you will make a profit of k if you sell the shares\n\nconversely a put is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date if you bought a put with a  strike and the share price went down to  this allows you to sell some shares at  that are now worth  each similarly to a call the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put\n\nwhen exercising each put contract you are selling  shares from your account when exercising each contract your  shares will be sold for k  for the strike multiplied by  shares and the same  shares are now worth k at  for each share not accounting for the price you paid for the put option this means you made a profit of k if you did not have the  shares per contract in your account you would be actually short selling the shares and you could make the k profit by buying these shares back\n\nin summary a call buys shares when exercising a put sells shares when exercising most importantly in the vast majority of the cases you should actually not exercise your contracts but instead you should sell your call or put at the market price as you will increase your profit see extrinsic value later\n\nbrokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money in other words you cant exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call you want to buy low when the value is high or current value is above the strike for a put you want to sell high when the value is low\n\nmost brokers do autoexercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised if the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date and you did not sell your contracts before they will be worthless and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost\n\nalthough i am mostly talking about american style options that can be exercised at any time there are also european style options that can only be exercised at expiration in the us markets pretty much all stocks and etfs are american style but the cashsettled indexes like spx and rut are european style\n\nthe basics intrinsic and extrinsic value\n\na call or a put contract costs money to buy called a premium so a rd party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put after all they wont take the other side of this contract for free and they have to be remunerated the minimum for a contract is  per share for some very liquid etfs but for most instruments it is  thus  per contract for  shares when you buy a call or put this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date the rd party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses see below\n\nthe value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike on the share price going up and down the shares volatility how fast  far it goes up or down and the time passing\n\nwhen you buy a contract the strike and the expiration date is known however the share price and volatility will constantly change all the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing closer to the expiration date\n\nthe intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price it is above  only when you can exercise the contract the extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time for pretty much all options this extrinsic value is above  and will slowly drop to  as we get closer to the expiration\n\nlets take an example with a share price of \n\nsay you buy a call with a strike of  expiring in a month for  the intrinsic value is     the extrinsic value is     said differently if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date your call contract would bring you  per share you would have lost  due to the time passing\n\nsimilarly you buy a put with a strike of  expiring in a month for  the intrinsic value is     the extrinsic value is    \n\nit is worth noting that any call with a strike price at  or above has  of intrinsic value if you pay  for a  call all the  is extrinsic value if the stock price does not go over  you will lose the full  per share so a  loss per contract similarly a put with a strike price at  or below has  of intrinsic value if you pay  for a  call all the  is extrinsic value your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under \n\nnote that in these examples i use the same price for the call and put options that are  away from the strike price but its not always the case the call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility market expectations potential dividends cost of money etc\n\nthe basics at the moment itm and otm\n\nthere are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls\n\nan option is at the money at the moment when the current share value is matching the strike the share price is  and the strike of  for both the call and put contracts will be considered at the money\n\nan option is in the money itm when the contract has some intrinsic value the share price is  so a call at  is in the money with  of intrinsic value a put at  is in the money with  of intrinsic value too\n\nan option is deep in the money when the option is itm and the strike is far from the current share price for example more than  for example with a share price of  a  call will be considered deep in the money same for a  put\n\nconversely an option is out of the money if there is no intrinsic value with a  share price a  call is out of the money a  put is out of the money the money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value there is no intrinsic value an option is deep out of the money when the option is otm and the strike is far from the

{"prompt": "disclaimer i am not a financial advisor this entire post represents my personal views and opinions and should not be taken as financial advice or advice of any kind whatsoever i encourage you to do your own research take anything i write with a grain of salt and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch also full disclosure i hold a net long position in gme but my cost basis is very low and im using money i can absolutely lose my capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours \n\nrather than doing a writeup of friday i think the time i have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics  as i mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week my first glance was that friday was a low conviction low volume day where momentum tradersand volatility arbitraging hft algos were skirmishing and a slightly deeper look tells me thats probably the case for almost the entire day up to the last minutes before close\n\nthere was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain  keep in mind also that on friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with gme and gme price was also protected from aggressive shortside attack due to the uptick rule\n\n capital flow liquid float and price\n\nok so lets go with a diagram i put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze  this is not very formaljust conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price liquid free float and capital required to move things around\n\n\n\nas you can see in the diagram i figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw\n\non the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold which moves the fulcrum to the left\n\nthe lower the liquid free float or the further to the left the fulcrum goes the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow net selling or buying on share price  importantly as the diagrams on the right half show its not a linear relationship  the closer the liquid free float comes to  the faster the price volatility increases theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches \n\ni find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify  on the extremely liquid side if you have all of the tens of millions of gme shares in play dropping  in to buy shares probably doesnt even register on the ticker  on the other extreme if what if there was only  share in play  that same  instantly prices gme at  a shareif you can even get the person holding it to sell\n\nsince company value is estimated marktomarket gme would instantly become rated one of the most  if not the most valuable companies in the world  this is in no way true of course as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to reprice the company\n\nso in the grand scheme of things in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze the primary factor is locking up actively tradedliquid free float  also important to keep in mind locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility reaching its limit where going from  actively traded shares to  actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share\n\nso simple right  actually yes however dont mistake simple for easy absolutely not the same thing in this case\n\n market games\n\nso gme and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants  on the one hand you have normal investors and traders who dont really pay attention to it at all and if they do they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility people tend to short stocks as price goes up and cover shorts as price drops so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable\n\nthen you have what ill call market gamers  these are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish and just pay attention to what they actually do  there are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance and shorting is one of them as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a companys share price and actually harm the company badly  the counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze which gets worse with extreme price volatility\n\nimagine it this way  short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange featurea closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that if slammed with a high enough day or week end price blows open and sucks their account capital through and possibly their brokers capital too until theyve patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short\n\nthats not how youre supposed to look at it but thats kind of how it actually works in practice  most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way but with millenials and younger jumping in to the market were talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing  through games intended to take to complete using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers  thats kind of what gme is like from a certain point of viewa speed run through the market blitzing and confusing everyone watchingthrowing a ton of money at hedge funds short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole  of course people are getting jumpy\n\n battleground  strategy and tactics\n\nin a way gme has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people  wall street vs wsb is basically the way its been depicted in the media and a number of them seem to be taking it personally\n\nwith a battleground stock i find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground but with territory marked out by stock price  it helps you consider the impact on each side what their motives are and tactical and strategic implications  the reason i think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground the issue is no longer about price discoveryits about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal which changes the dynamics of the trade\n\nin my opinion the retail strengthdefensive line is at the  level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week  this is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from  to  which triggered the first squeeze\n\nmy guess is shortside strength hardens at the  level based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze  what this means is that you can expect some shortside people to actively short more at that level possibly following through on momentum as many of them want to prove a point that gme is a  stock as stated by a number of them on cnbc   might seem like a low number given fridays close but remember that friday trading was subject to the uptick rule so the short effectively could not push back and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the longside advance as much as possible and lure them off their strength as much as possible\n\nsay what  is there a point to those analogies like that  why yes of course because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign\n\nremember in the grand scheme of things the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float  that means buying and holding shares  the question is how much will it cost you to move the needle on that so to speak  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float the longer itll take and the more expensive it will be  it is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out loosening float back up\n\nhow about on the long side  you want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so  this means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair  why  because it means youre buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float and also that their short position is at a lower average price lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze\n\nthe above is why in some cases you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze  you can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning  once you think youve accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move you spike the price back the other way and its effectively game over  it can take some time to play out to its conclusion but that is the essence of it\n\nlets make it concrete and put some numbers to it  lets say you need to lock up mio more shares for the squeeze no idea just using the number for easy math  if you can buy it all skirmishing at the  line youll pay bn to do it  if instead youve extended to the  line youre going to pay bn  if youre an alphaseeking whale why pay  more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it  if you recall i referenced seeing what i thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my rd post\n\nthat being said you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think youre already close to blowing up the next short interest holder\n\nif you think youre close then youre looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible\n\nthat is very similar to the price action we saw on friday at the end of the day as mentioned earlier  if you think about it if the goal is the have the price atabove a certain point at the end of the day what is more efficient  rush in the morning then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it or wait until later in the day as late as you think you can manage and then push to that point at the very last tick\n\nthat at least is a very high level view of what youre trying to accomplish but it gets very complicated in the details  if youre dueling with a good hft algorithm you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock kind of like fouling someone in basketball which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider luld allowances but still doable even if you have to do it by sucking price level up maybe to give you  mins to call your buddy at blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that\n\nanother thing to keep in mind  one of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time is it might not be a one and done blowout possibly on purpose  think about itif you can get people to keep piling short interest inparticularly for emotional reasons you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point  think of the citron guy who reshorted back in around what  or  i think  all because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of   there are people piling back in right now  who knows how many times theyre willing to reload the short float\n\nok so this post is much longer than i originally intended anyway but i think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion  a number of people asked me why i said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point  if you havent already figured out why try to think about it or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion\n\na couple of final points\n\n assuming the longside people continue to lock up liquid float remember that volatility can get greater in both directions  this can mean that you get wiped out if youre somehow still trading gme on margin as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later\n greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside  premarket and after hours trading dont have circuit breakers so it could get wild during those times too\n also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently  after the first frustrating day of this happening with gme i made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so id have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen  for those of you on tos use it on the  minute chart  note that the luld tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day so youd have to adjust the parameters or just keep it in mind  i use it with the step lines vs the default line  if price crosses the guard lines then youre getting closeif it crosses the circuit breaker line then youre about to be or already are getting halted  here

that friday was a low conviction low volume day where momentum tradersand volatility arbitraging hft algos were skirmishing and a slightly deeper look tells me thats probably the case for almost the entire day up to the last minutes before close\n\nthere was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain  keep in mind also that on friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with gme and gme price was also protected from aggressive shortside attack due to the uptick rule\n\n capital flow liquid float and price\n\nok so lets go with a diagram i put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze  this is not very formaljust conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price liquid free float and capital required to move things around\n\n\n\nas you can see in the diagram i figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw\n\non the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold which moves the fulcrum to the left\n\nthe lower the liquid free float or the further to the left the fulcrum goes the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow net selling or buying on share price  importantly as the diagrams on the right half show its not a linear relationship  the closer the liquid free float comes to  the faster the price volatility increases theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches \n\ni find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify  on the extremely liquid side if you have all of the tens of millions of gme shares in play dropping  in to buy shares probably doesnt even register on the ticker  on the other extreme if what if there was only  share in play  that same  instantly prices gme at  a shareif you can even get the person holding it to sell\n\nsince company value is estimated marktomarket gme would instantly become rated one of the most  if not the most valuable companies in the world  this is in no way true of course as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to reprice the company\n\nso in the grand scheme of things in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze the primary factor is locking up actively tradedliquid free float  also important to keep in mind locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility reaching its limit where going from  actively traded shares to  actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share\n\nso simple right  actually yes however dont mistake simple for easy absolutely not the same thing in this case\n\n market games\n\nso gme and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants  on the one hand you have normal investors and traders who dont really pay attention to it at all and if they do they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility people tend to short stocks as price goes up and cover shorts as price drops so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable\n\nthen you have what ill call market gamers  these are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish and just pay attention to what they actually do  there are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance and shorting is one of them as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a companys share price and actually harm the company badly  the counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze which gets worse with extreme price volatility\n\nimagine it this way  short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange featurea closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that if slammed with a high enough day or week end price blows open and sucks their account capital through and possibly their brokers capital too until theyve patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short\n\nthats not how youre supposed to look at it but thats kind of how it actually works in practice  most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way but with millenials and younger jumping in to the market were talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing  through games intended to take to complete using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers  thats kind of what gme is like from a certain point of viewa speed run through the market blitzing and confusing everyone watchingthrowing a ton of money at hedge funds short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole  of course people are getting jumpy\n\n battleground  strategy and tactics\n\nin a way gme has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people  wall street vs wsb is basically the way its been depicted in the media and a number of them seem to be taking it personally\n\nwith a battleground stock i find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground but with territory marked out by stock price  it helps you consider the impact on each side what their motives are and tactical and strategic implications  the reason i think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground the issue is no longer about price discoveryits about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal which changes the dynamics of the trade\n\nin my opinion the retail strengthdefensive line is at the  level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week  this is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from  to  which triggered the first squeeze\n\nmy guess is shortside strength hardens at the  level based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze  what this means is that you can expect some shortside people to actively short more at that level possibly following through on momentum as many of them want to prove a point that gme is a  stock as stated by a number of them on cnbc   might seem like a low number given fridays close but remember that friday trading was subject to the uptick rule so the short effectively could not push back and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the longside advance as much as possible and lure them off their strength as much as possible\n\nsay what  is there a point to those analogies like that  why yes of course because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign\n\nremember in the grand scheme of things the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float  that means buying and holding shares  the question is how much will it cost you to move the needle on that so to speak  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float the longer itll take and the more expensive it will be  it is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out loosening float back up\n\nhow about on the long side  you want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so  this means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair  why  because it means youre buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float and also that their short position is at a lower average price lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze\n\nthe above is why in some cases you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze  you can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning  once you think youve accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move you spike the price back the other way and its effectively game over  it can take some time to play out to its conclusion but that is the essence of it\n\nlets make it concrete and put some numbers to it  lets say you need to lock up mio more shares for the squeeze no idea just using the number for easy math  if you can buy it all skirmishing at the  line youll pay bn to do it  if instead youve extended to the  line youre going to pay bn  if youre an alphaseeking whale why pay  more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it  if you recall i referenced seeing what i thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my rd post\n\nthat being said you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think youre already close to blowing up the next short interest holder\n\nif you think youre close then youre looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible\n\nthat is very similar to the price action we saw on friday at the end of the day as mentioned earlier  if you think about it if the goal is the have the price atabove a certain point at the end of the day what is more efficient  rush in the morning then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it or wait until later in the day as late as you think you can manage and then push to that point at the very last tick\n\nthat at least is a very high level view of what youre trying to accomplish but it gets very complicated in the details  if youre dueling with a good hft algorithm you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock kind of like fouling someone in basketball which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider luld allowances but still doable even if you have to do it by sucking price level up maybe to give you  mins to call your buddy at blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that\n\nanother thing to keep in mind  one of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time is it might not be a one and done blowout possibly on purpose  think about itif you can get people to keep piling short interest inparticularly for emotional reasons you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point  think of the citron guy who reshorted back in around what  or  i think  all because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of   there are people piling back in right now  who knows how many times theyre willing to reload the short float\n\nok so this post is much longer than i originally intended anyway but i think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion  a number of people asked me why i said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point  if you havent already figured out why try to think about it or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion\n\na couple of final points\n\n assuming the longside people continue to lock up liquid float remember that volatility can get greater in both directions  this can mean that you get wiped out if youre somehow still trading gme on margin as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later\n greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside  premarket and after hours trading dont have circuit breakers so it could get wild during those times too\n also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently  after the first frustrating day of this happening with gme i made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so id have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen  for those of you on tos use it on the  minute chart  note that the luld tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day so youd have to adjust the parameters or just keep it in mind  i use it with the step lines vs the default line  if price crosses the guard lines then youre getting closeif it crosses the circuit breaker line then youre about to be or already are getting halted  here

really wacky stuff going on in nikolas presentations and financial projections and i wanted to share my findings\n\nxb\n\nthis is an absolute wall of words and i wouldnt be offended if you didnt want to read it all  in the first half i try to tease out the cost per mile of an actual fuel cell electric vehicle fcev given the specification nikola lists   next there is a portion where i look at the discrepancies between their financial projections and their lease breakdown   then a quick little peanut gallery where i look at their unrealistic assumptions and the hypocrisy of their comparisons  finally a more serious portion where i discuss the design efficiency and utility implications of nikolas chosen power output and battery capacity  hope you guys enjoy\n\nxb\n\nlets get started\n\nnikola claims that they have the industry first holistic leasing program including maintenance fuel and use of the vehicle they plan on leasing for  per mile   margin  this implies an expense of   per mile to nikola\n\nhydrogen costs\n\naccording to the doe it currently costs kg to produce compress and dispense hydrogen  nikola claims they can do this for kg  i highly doubt their estimate and will elaborate on that later  hydrogen has a specific energy  kwhkg  a fuel cell electric vehicle fcev has an average thermal efficiency of   a diesel semi tractor which easily compares to nikolas offerings consumes about  kwh of work per km or  per mile of useful work loaded\n\nthis implies the nikola truck will use  kwh of hydrogen per mile at a cost of  per mile or  using their estimates  the doe estimate could be pretty rosy as well hindenburg cited a practical price of  per kg for hydrogen in their report  nikolas estimate in the leasing breakdown is  miles per kg of hydrogen   per kg  that works out to mile  our estimates are pretty close excluding hydrogen costs  it looks like in a surprising twist they actually overestimated the energy consumption of a tractor  or maybe not  well get to that\n\nicct tractortrailer fuel consumption  \n\nwhy do i doubt their hydrogen cost estimates   per kg implies  per kwh of hydrogen produced  the average price for industrial electricity in arizona the state they are headquartered in was kwh some of the cheapest in the us  of course there isnt a  conversion of electricity to hydrogen an electrolyzer uses about  kwh per kg of hydrogen  specific energy of kwhkg making the electricity expense alone in excess of  per kwh of hydrogen  electricity must also be used to compress the hydrogen  this would take another  kwh though were already over budget  god forbid they use california electricity at an average cost of  per kwh  the electricity expense for the electrolyzers alone exceeds their estimates much less depreciation expense cost of capital maintenance expense salary expense etc  clearly a bogus number\n\ni suppose they can use renewable excess during offhours for cheap but the rapidly decreasing costs of energy storage will likely level out those low prices rather quickly  this also only works in arizona and a select few other states california not included  there is the issue of a startup paying to build huge electrolyzers that might have a utilization factor of  and additional high pressure storage will be needed  the abhorrent upfront capex needed to try and drive down operating costs is not viable for them\n\neia electricity prices nationwide  \n\nnrel h cost analysis from   this is just about the most recent research i can find  the abject lack of new material tells me its not exactly a hoppin field  \n\nfuel cell costs\n\npart of the reason there are currently so few fcvs on the road today is the limited service life of a fuel cell  fuel cells are precision manufactured components that degrade quickly when jostled  vibrated too violently  this is not good when combined with the rockhard suspensions of semi tractors\n\nthe doe targets a useful life of  miles for a fuel cell  currently there is no information confirming this target has been met  a toyota murai comes with a  mile warranty on its fc  for the sake of argument i will assume nikola fcs can meet this target  the doe targets a cost of kw for fuel cell production in  provided mass hits   this hasnt happened yet but i will again assume this to give nikola the best chance  as an aside  nikolas decision to use exclusively gm fc technology in their badger pickup indicates to me they have nothing up their sleeve to make the technology more viable despite my optimistic assumptions\n\nill assume the nikola twos fuel cell is  kw less than the  kw claimed output  i think it  likely their horsepower claim will be a peak power figure only achievable when the motors draw on the battery  fc  i cannot confirm this because nikola does not list the output of their motors and fc separately along with myriad other questionable or lack of claims  i think this is reasonable considering fc thermal efficiency is maximized between  and  load and a semi will average  kw of useful work required on the highway translating to  kw of fc usage  this is near the peak efficiency band of a pemfc  this assumption also allows steadystate operation at  of the rated output  this implies an upfront cost of   a targeted useful life of  miles implies a depreciation expense of  per mile\n\nnrel stack durability and performance vs load chart  \n\nbattery costs\n\nusing bnef  battery cost estimates of kwh that equates to  of battery expense  assuming a useful life of m miles more than any existing warranty currently covers that results in a depreciation expense of  per mile\n\nchassis and the rest\n\nlastly i extrapolated an fcev cogs of  per truck from their financial projections minus the  of equipment already listed and a  scrap value i pulled out of my ass to try and help nikola here leaves  depreciated over k miles or a  depreciation expense per mile\n\nmaintenance costs\n\nnikola assumed a mile maintenance cost  any engineer should be able to see such a claim and immediately question it  tires alone should account for  per mile  that leaves  for brakes air lines hvac wiring electrical equipment motors inverters those battery and fc expenses i already calculated sensors etc  they make no additional provisions for the batteryfc in their leasing breakdown  pure unadulterated bullshit   the icct puts bev per mile maintenance at mile  how they squeezed  of those costs out as an unproven startup by going for a more complex fcbev hybrid is beyond me\n\ncost of trucking  \n\nnikola leasing cost breakdown p  \n\nleasing conclusions\n\nadding their laughably low per mile maintenance expense of          gives us an aggregate  per mile expense for nikola  using their fuel expense estimate of  this equates to  still more than their projected gross expenses  the first estimate is  over they need for their claimed  gross margin at  per mile  note  i used a projected battery expense projected fc service life target and projected fc production expense  none of these have been met  i used the average resitive forces acting on a us tractortrailer which appear to be lower than the number nikola uses  i did not include warranty expenses in my estimate  additionally these are expenses and includes  profit for the suppliers of these parts  the gmnikola deal clearly shows there will be little vertical integration in their production and such allowances would have to be made\n\na more reasonable estimate including a still optimistic  interest expense for truck capex a  annual warranty expense corresponding to their presented  estimated reserve  that reserve by the way is very optimistic  tesla used a higher reserve on the s for years while building a simpler product with a warranty lengthdistance a literal order of magnitude lower than the nikola truck  a still low maintenance expense of  and a  margin for battery  fc production we end up with an  per mile expense or more than nikola can afford even when using their untenable  per kg hydrogen estimate  this is before ga expenses  their leasing business model is not possible\n\nlease projections v income projections  internal chaos or outright fraud\n\nits possible some of the folks at nikola have already found those problems out though  nikola says they have plans to lease their trucks  theyve had presentation slides including the idea and their truck descriptions on their website include a leasing plan  in their most recent presentation at the db global auto industry conference in june however the leasing cost breakdown slide was conspicuously missing  their financial projections slide showed  fcev trucks being produced in  and  million in revenue from fcev sales  this represents  per truck and their fcev revenue scales exactly linearly into their  projected sales no room for residual from the  trucks  theyre projecting to sell them  revenue from maintenance and hydrogen sales are also listed separately  their financial projections clearly show the upfront sale of trucks with additional hydrogen fueling and maintenance revenue and the leasing model slide has disappeared  its easy to see why  their projected combined expenses and capex exceeds  billion through  significantly more than their current  billion in assets and a couple of lease payments would allow for  this would take some intense share dilution not something i think trevor would be on board with or extremely expensive leverage\n\nits not like theyre going to get cheap loans secured against their proprietary trucks requiring their proprietary stations to run only their customers preset routes  a bank wouldnt want that kind of collateral  the leasing idea is a real mess\n\nnikla db presentation projections are nd to last page  \n\none can claim that the lease model is still in the description of the trucks but so are battery and fuel cell specifications for the nikola one  the nikola one was ostensibly never actually powered by hydrogen and development has since been abandoned  it looks like their leasing idea may have been abandoned as well\n\nill also point out that an expected  fcev maintenance revenue of  million on  trucks sold assuming an average of  miles per truck sold in  the average mileage if the trucks are sold at a constant rate through the fy and  per truck in  equates to  cents per mile more than double the  projected maintenance costs in the april lease presentation  either they plan on making a killing from maintenance or there was some aggressive reshuffling of numbers when maintenance went from an expense to revenue stream or vice versa\n\nthe same analysis of hydrogen expenses puts their per kg revenue at   still low but a hefty sum above their  cost average on the leasing slide\n\nif we use their projected fcev maintenance revenue of   per kg h revenue and  truck price depreciated over  years wno interest expense the cost of ownership according to their income projections is  per mile for a  mile year  more than they say a diesel will cost  oops\n\nthats most of what i wanted to talk about  its pretty clear that nikola cannot possibly make a profit with their lease model and nikolas finance department has indirectly acknowledged this  hydrogen tech is still many many years away  nikolas move fast and break things approach though im not convinced weve seen much moving outside of gravity assists will end up a move fast and bankrupt things strategy\n\nxb\n\n\n\nxb\n\ni now want to take a few moments to look at some of the sillier things i found in my research\n\nin a laughably exuberant turn of events nikola projects  gross margins during their first year of production  thats downright cute  they plan on ostensibly slapping gm fcs  batteries on iveco platforms and beating the margins of all publicly traded auto companies sans ferrari within a few months of production start  its that easy  get your shit together ford\n\non nikolas website under their trucks they have a comparison of fcs bevs and diesel where they seem to forget their trucks have hundreds of kwhs of battery storage onboard  they claim hydrogen acts as a buffer and grid balance while batteries are a drain on the grid  you heard it hear first folks batteries cant be used as a grid buffer only a grid drain  they also claim h is the most abundant element on the planet while batteries are made of nonrenewable resources dangerouscostly to mine  makes me wonder why they chose to put so many on their trucks  also hilariously hypocritical considering platinum required for pemfcs is one of the rarest metals on earth\n\ndesign considerations and odd choices\n\ni want to take a moment to talk about chassis design and the implications of nikolas set power parameters  and i want to start with a quote from elon musk during the tesla semi reveal\n\nwe designed the tesla truck like a bullet musk said a normal diesel truck is designed like a barn wall the tesla semi is more aerodynamic than a  million bugatti chiron sports car he said\n\na bold claim but i believe this to be correct  cheesy but correct  why  cooling requirements  the more cooling air you need the less favorable aerodynamics youll have  in the simple representation of an engine there is a fuel input a work output and a heat output  a gas engine  especially one not designed with fuel efficiency in mind like the chirons will likely only output  of its fuel input as a work output  the chiron makes  hp and needs to reject  hp of heat at full throttle  the goal of a chiron isnt to slip through the air au contraire  its designed suck in as much air as possible for cooling and brute its way to  mph through raw horsepower  most modern sedans have more favorable aerodynamics than a bugatti\n\nxb\n\non the other hand about  of the inputs from an ev charger make it to the wheels  a major factor that makes evs so efficient  this means elon can put for example  hp of motors in his truck and only worry about rejecting  hp of heat at full load an easy task  thats less cooling than a prius needs and the truck can be designed with virtually zero air input constraints  he can swing his x the acceleration dick around and the only tradeoff is beefier driveline bits for the extra torque and bigger motors\n\ncd lists on wikipedia  note almost every production car below cd is either a small displacement diesel or electric  no supercars in sight  \n\nthe chirons standard cd is   a  ford windstar minivan has a standard cd of   not exactly a prestigious club haha\n\n\n\nhydrogen is a different story  the thermal efficiency of a fcev above  load will dip down into the  range  the average efficiency of a diesel truck is  and it will dip to  at max rpm full load  ever seen the video where trevor says the production trucks wont need as much cooling as their current prototypes  hes lying through his teeth  a  hp fc would need more than  hp of cooling as much if not more than a hp diesel  its also important to note that less heat is lost in exhaust from a pemfc and lower operating temps mean that actual cooling airflow required is significantly more than an equivalent diesel would require   hp diesels are already built like a brick with a front aftercooler  radiator the size of a football field  trevors dick swinging has major consequences  more cooling means more drag more weight in heat sinksradiators and more power draw to move coolant  these all create positive feedback loops eg more air requirements mean less favorable aerodynamics  more drag which means more power draw at speed which means more cooling which means more air requirements  its not all fun and games like the pure bev tesla is making\n\nxb\n\ndaimlers recently announced h semi offering only has  kw and they can recycle their waste heat to warm up incoming liquid hydrogen nikola uses compressed hydrogen and wont have the same luxury  running so much horsepower is a real head scratcher one would think their head of rds only experience was pouring concrete or something\n\nxb\n\nits also important to note us tractortrailers are hard capped at  lbs  this means that every pound of tractor weight is a pound taken from potential cargo  yknow the part that actually makes money  one has to wonder why nikola is keeping  lbs of batteries on the tractor their website showed they arent fans of the stuff  its enough to run a loaded tractor two full hours on battery alone more than a regenerative braking system would require or power peaking during a hill climb  its dumb  kwh would be more than enough when an ondemand primemover like a hydrogen cell is also onboard  its an expensive and opulent display to the vexation of customers who would in all likelihood much prefer an extra  tons of cargo capacity\n\nfeatures like  hp and  kwh of battery appeal more to retail investors than trucking companies\n\nxb\n\nactual conclusion time  i think that i pretty conclusively showed that\n\n nikolas hydrogen cost projections are bogus  there isnt even enough money there to pay for the electrolysis and compression much less maintenance depreciation or labor\n nikolas leasing costs undercutting diesel is bogus  one can disprove that with their own financial projections much less the real costs of fcs and h electrolysis\n nikolas plan to lease the trucks is totally divorced from reality according to their own financial projections\n nikolas projected per mile operating  maintenance expenses are beyond indefensible\n a myriad of odd marketing focused design choices limit the trucks onroad efficiency and utility to potential customers\n\nif you made it this far congrats", "completion": "mechanical engineer here who used to design

not possible\n\nlease projections v income projections  internal chaos or outright fraud\n\nits possible some of the folks at nikola have already found those problems out though  nikola says they have plans to lease their trucks  theyve had presentation slides including the idea and their truck descriptions on their website include a leasing plan  in their most recent presentation at the db global auto industry conference in june however the leasing cost breakdown slide was conspicuously missing  their financial projections slide showed  fcev trucks being produced in  and  million in revenue from fcev sales  this represents  per truck and their fcev revenue scales exactly linearly into their  projected sales no room for residual from the  trucks  theyre projecting to sell them  revenue from maintenance and hydrogen sales are also listed separately  their financial projections clearly show the upfront sale of trucks with additional hydrogen fueling and maintenance revenue and the leasing model slide has disappeared  its easy to see why  their projected combined expenses and capex exceeds  billion through  significantly more than their current  billion in assets and a couple of lease payments would allow for  this would take some intense share dilution not something i think trevor would be on board with or extremely expensive leverage\n\nits not like theyre going to get cheap loans secured against their proprietary trucks requiring their proprietary stations to run only their customers preset routes  a bank wouldnt want that kind of collateral  the leasing idea is a real mess\n\nnikla db presentation projections are nd to last page  \n\none can claim that the lease model is still in the description of the trucks but so are battery and fuel cell specifications for the nikola one  the nikola one was ostensibly never actually powered by hydrogen and development has since been abandoned  it looks like their leasing idea may have been abandoned as well\n\nill also point out that an expected  fcev maintenance revenue of  million on  trucks sold assuming an average of  miles per truck sold in  the average mileage if the trucks are sold at a constant rate through the fy and  per truck in  equates to  cents per mile more than double the  projected maintenance costs in the april lease presentation  either they plan on making a killing from maintenance or there was some aggressive reshuffling of numbers when maintenance went from an expense to revenue stream or vice versa\n\nthe same analysis of hydrogen expenses puts their per kg revenue at   still low but a hefty sum above their  cost average on the leasing slide\n\nif we use their projected fcev maintenance revenue of   per kg h revenue and  truck price depreciated over  years wno interest expense the

buying an option with no intrinsic value not itm has the potential to be worthless upon expiration  \n\nthat said theyre not always bad depending on your strategy  for example buying an otm option is sort of like buying a house with a  interest mortgage your monthly mortgage payments only go towards the interest but not towards the principal of the house  some people actually do this because they believe the value of the house will go up and theyll resell it for profit\n\n\n\n\n\nleverage\n\nthis is a very important concept which early options traders dont realize right away and is the reason options can be so powerful andor dangerous\n\noptions harness the power of leverage by relying on changes in price to derive their values and not necessarily the price of the underlying  for example lets compare mcd and grpn currently trading at  and  respectively  if you look at their march expirations options youll see that the price for an atthemoney call strike prices  and  is about  for each of them  and yes i realize mcd is not quite  yet but if you factor out intrinsic and extrinsic values youll end up about the same\n\nso for  you can buy a call which expires next month for either of these two companies and youve exposed yourself to  shares of said company \n\nnow ceteris paribus if the price of both grpn and mcd went up tomorrow by  the price of the mcd call would go up to around  while the price of grpns call would go up to around   thats the difference between profiting  vs   \n\nand the reason for this is because if mcd went up by  it would be up  and if grpn went up by  it would only be up by  and the premium only cares about relative price movement and not necessarily about the underlyings value this is a simplification\n\nthis is also why expensive stocks like aapl and goog are popular with options gamblers because as youve already seen here they can have huge swings  and this is also how a lot of people go broke\n\n\ni realize i sped through this topic  if it left you confused ask and ill either reply or modify the post\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe chain\n\n\nand finally the chain  this is just to tie up some of these concepts and you can see what they look like in

most chains will be similar in nature and information\n\n\n\n\n purple circles  calls and related metrics bid price ask price volume and open interest\n\n blue circles  puts and related metrics bid price ask price volume and open interest\n\n green circles  expiration date\n\n cyan circles  strike prices\n\n yellow circles  options that are at or very near the money\n\nthe other numbers are for a later day\n\nalso to highlight the risks involved go back and look at the february expiration contracts still open under oi both calls and puts which are expiring worthless tomorrow  if you go back and look at marchs prices youll pretty much get an idea of what those contracts were worth a month ago  thats a lot of money lost\n\n\ncontinued reading", "completion": "jartek im going to thank you

{"prompt": "recommended reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis really should be a  level since it involves some numbers although you wont yet need a calculator but ill just keep the numbering sequential for ocd sake  on that note im aiming this at people who read and understood the first two  which were brief but dense  also were getting to the point where i cant generalize options as much so note that this post and probably the rest is geared more towards trading options as opposed to things like hedging or using as synthetic instruments  as usual corrections are welcome\n\n\ndisclaimer i am writing this as an educational supplement  my motivation for writing these has been explicitly to help fill the gap in more advanced conversations  by no means am i encouraging anyone to trade with this information  its worth pointing out that in efforts to make these short and productive ive trimmed out the potentially ridiculous risk with options  perhaps ill dedicate an entire post for that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexchange\n\nquick note on this  unlike stocks which are listed in specific exchanges like nasdaq or nyse stock options are not bound to a particular exchange since theyre essentially just bets  its worth knowing that the chicago board options exchange or cboe is the biggest among them theres like  or so \nother ones and is home to the all popular vix more on this at a later date  but to make things simple when picking an exchange theres usually a  choice which figures it out for you\n\n\n\n\n\nthe market\n\nso its finally time to pick some options  well just like stocks the first stop is to check out the prices  but now were going to pay special attention to the market as well because although market conditions play a part in stocks they play a crucial role with options  also if youre speculating on a price move the trick is to shop around for opportunities involving various strategies using options andor stocks because there are many ways to bet  many more than just up or down that is  \n\nwhile looking at buying options a good rule of thumb is to make sure theres healthy a lot of volume  having a liquid market will make sure that theres enough buyers and sellers to get in and back out of the position with relative ease  its entirely possible that you buy an option and then have nobody to sell it back to at a halfway reasonable price when the time is right  \n\nthis also tends to tighten up the bidask spread remember bid is sell price ask is buy price  this is another big difference with options  typically when buying stocks as long as theyre somewhat popular i dont even look at the spread  in fact most popular stock quoters wont even show them  but youll notice that options chains rarely have a single price and instead show you the bidask separately  the reason for this is that with options pennies matter  and the spread will consume into your profits  \n\ntake a look at this  with march expiration  youll see that there are some options with  cent spread green and others with  cent spreads red  if you were to buy options from the red circle youre instantly losing  dollars per contract not to mention commissions  i just checked some aapl jan  calls and some of them have like a  spread  thats  per contract instantly evaporated\n\nthe  factors i can think of that determine liquidity are option popularity some stocks dont attract options traders and strike price  expiration date  even popular stocks lose volume if you look to far ahead or if you pick strike prices that are far from the money  \n\nmake that   open interest or oi or original poster int  this is a metric that youll typically see in options chains indicating the number of live contracts which are out on the market high oi would imply that theres high volume the reason why volume and oi are not necessarily the same is because in practice you can write a contract create a new one and adding  to the oi tally and later buy it back subtracting  to oi tally  if this scenario played out in an empty market the volume would be  and oi would be \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntiming\n\ntiming is everything with options  remember that the moment you buy an option it starts losing extrinsic value from time decay so this is important  as noted by  in the last post time decay is not linear  meaning that stocks wont lose a set amount every day until expiration  \n\n\n showing what the time decay looks like as dictated by the  model  youll notice the drop in price due to time decay exponentially increases at  days from expiration  this doesnt mean options with less than  days are no good but if you buy them it should be part of your strategy like say a day trade\n\n\nanother important thing to consider is recent news with the underlying stock  big events can temporarily dislodge prices which you can also use in your favor if you want  announced dividends is a big one  for various reasons on an exdividend date call prices will go down and put prices will go up  another big one is earnings releases  youll notice a huge buildup in premiums due to implied volatility as an earnings release approaches and then a huge drop the day after  this affects calls and puts alike  \n\n\n\n\n\nedit strike price\n\ncredit to  for bringing this up\n\n\nadditional observation from  who points out that this point becomes gray area when the strike and underlying price are close\n\nanother important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value because after all when the expiration day comes thats all theyre worth  so buying an option with no intrinsic value not itm has the potential to be worthless upon expiration  \n\nthat said theyre not always bad depending on your strategy  for example buying an otm option is sort of like buying a house with a  interest mortgage your monthly mortgage payments only go towards the interest but not towards the principal of the house  some people actually do this because they believe the value of the house will go up and theyll resell it for profit\n\n\n\n\n\nleverage\n\nthis is a very important concept which early options traders dont realize right away and is the reason options can be so powerful andor dangerous\n\noptions harness the power of leverage by relying on changes in price to derive their values and not necessarily the price of the underlying  for example lets compare mcd and grpn currently trading at  and  respectively  if you look at their march expirations options youll see that the price for an atthemoney call strike prices  and  is about  for each of them  and yes i realize mcd is not quite  yet but if you factor out intrinsic and extrinsic values youll end up about the same\n\nso for  you can buy a call which expires next month for either of

worth\n\n  thats a little bit misleading because only as we get very close to expiration do we know who is in the money in other words you could argue that it is more risky to buy a slightly in the

the first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past  years\n\n for almost  investors shows staggering results  of gen z and  of millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market more than  of the surveyed population borrowed more than k or more for investing while leverage works great in a bull market it can destroy your portfolio during downturns \n\n shows an even more concerning trend retail brokers alone are now trading more options than the entire market used to do in  while this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as robinhood fidelity etrade etc its highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it\n\nrise of new issues and speculative assets\n\nmore than  billion have been raised by ipos this year this is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the  record in the dust the cherry on top was  where the company is now valued at more than  billion with zero revenue and less than  million in preorder deposits\n\nspacs \n\nthis is without even getting into the speculative world of crypto where  for more than half a billion dollars a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of  billion and there are now more icos than anyone can keep track of\n\ninvestor expectations\n\nmore than the pe ratio i the pricetosales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the companys sales as we can see on the chart below more than double the companies are trading above x their sales when compared to the  dot com bubble\n\nif you consider a  stocks that had a very high ps ratio have underperformed those having low ps ratio since most companies dont grow as per expectations\n\nnow thats a lot of bad news for anyone to digest but\n\nare we certain its a bubble\n\nthere are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally just because we are in an impressive rally it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash lets look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years\n\nlowinterest rates\n\nthis is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the s dotcom bubble between  and  the fed rate varied from    compared to the  this means that the capital available now is much cheaper to prop up the economy after covid than it ever was this is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns\n\nnew investors\n\nits no secret that we all hate robinhood  shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investorstraders coming to the market all of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now\n\nk and index funds\n\nas i have highlighted in s the amount of inflow us index funds receive is massive more than  billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the vanguard  index fund this year and index funds are expected to make up  according to  from fidelity the average k account now has a balance of k and  of workers increased their contribution\n\nthe key point being all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \n\nwhats the implication\n\nas long as the above factors remain as is fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital we might see the party go on much longer than expected\n\nconclusion\n\nthe market of  is significantly different when compared to the s as we can see there are more investors cheaper capital and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before so i feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dotcom bubble is a tad wrong\n\nbut thats not to say that all is well almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future\n\nthe expected annual return by investors which is  more than what is realistic  this is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly doubledigit return is the norm\n\neven if we are in a dotcom bubblelike scenario  perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble\n\nbasically even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in  investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to tulip mania as early as  making money using that information was hard there were a few investors such as mark cuban and john templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected\n\nit makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market but pundits have been calling a  right now based on fundamentals the chances do look far higher it does make sense to not make significant onetime investments in the market now but changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best longterm strategy\n\nas peter lynch quoted\n\nfar more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves\n\nuntil next week\n\nfootnotes and existing research\n\n the amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zerocommission trading model was staggering in the s average commission per trade was \n\n as always i am not a financial advisor this is not investment advice please do your own research before investing\n\n leverage only makes sense as long as the equity you are investing into would give better returns than the cost of capital at which you borrowed otherwise your losses are magnified as you have to pay the interest for the borrowed money as well as take your losses on the underlying asset\n\n is a company that has no commercial operations and is formed strictly to

{"prompt": "russias stock market is set to have a partial reopening thursday nearly a month after it shut down following the invasion of ukraine\u00a0\nthe challenge for moscow is that the resumption of trading could simply send russian stocks back into free fall on feb  the day when president vladimir putin began the assault on ukraine the main russian stock index tumbled  while the index regained a fraction of those losses on feb its last day of tradingthat was before western sanctions hammered the ruble and sent the country into an economic crisis\n\nto limit the fallout moscow has turned to some heavyhanded policies it blocked foreign investors from dumping local stocksa move that some market participants saw as retaliation for a western freeze on russian central bank assets since a big chunk of the russian market is owned by foreigners the russian government ordered its main sovereignwealth fund to buy billions of dollars worth of shares\u00a0\n\nthe russian stock market could ultimately look very different than it did before with a plan under discussion to split it into separate markets for foreign and local investors according to a person familiar with the matter\n\nrussias central bank said wednesday that it will allow trading of  shares out of  included in the benchmark stock index the moex on thursday from  am to  pm moscow time among the companies to be traded are gazprom pjsc and lukoil pjsc bets on the fall of a stock known as shortselling will be banned\n\nunder a policy announced by the central bank on feb  russian brokerages arent allowed to let foreign clients sell securities this will prevent foreigners from bolting for the exits as soon as the market reopens which could be ruinous because of their outsize role in russian stocks international institutional investors held about threequarters of the russian markets free float as of february  according to sberbank investment research\n\nthat has raised concerns that the market will be skewed by the absence of foreign investors who accounted for nearly half of equities trading volume at the moscow exchange in the first half of last year\nthere will be an illusion of a working recovering russian stock market even though a huge class of players in the marketforeignerswont have the opportunity to sell said vladimir kreyndel ceo of etf consulting a moscow firm that advises issuers of exchangetraded funds\u00a0\n\namong the western investors that held russian stocks before the freeze were assetmanagement giants vanguard group and fidelity international both firms have said they are reducing exposure to russia\ndue to the freeze foreign investors wont have much to do when the stock market reopens\u00a0\n\nbut the plan under consideration by russian officialswhich is still in the discussion stageswould effectively split the countrys securities market in two with one market for foreigners and another for local investors the person familiar with the matter said in this arrangement foreign investors could sell their shares or bonds but would face restrictions on moving the proceeds out of russia because of capital controls that moscow has imposed since february the person said\n\nsuch a bifurcated market could result in oddities such as the same stock having two different prices that isnt completely unprecedented in china there have long been discrepancies between shares on mainland exchanges in shanghai and shenzhen and those listed in hong kong\nit could also prevent further erosion of the rubles value russias currency has stabilized in recent sessions to trade near  rubles to the dollar though it remains  weaker than before russia invaded ukraine\n\nthe biggest fear is that the central bank is under sanctions and they dont want foreign investors to sell their shares and take the ruble and buy hard currency said jacob grapengiesser head of eastern europe at emerging markets fund manager east capital\n\nthe moscow exchange said monday that it would allow for the settlement of trades that foreign investors had placed before feb  that were still being processed mr grapengiesser said his firm had trades still awaiting settlement from the start of the war that he expects to go through soon\u00a0\n\nits a natural step before opening the market you need to take care of those unsettled trades he said things are slowly moving forward\nshortly after the war began russias prime minister ordered the countrys national wealth fund to buy up to one trillion rubles equivalent to  billion worth of shares this year analysts also expect some russian oil companies to prop up their share prices with buyback programs\n\nlocal investors may buy stocks too when russia invaded crimea the moex fell almost  between midfebruary and midmarch of  but by the end of that year it had rebounded more than  from that march low the broad index has posted gains in all but one year since  stocks in unstable countries can also serve as hedges against inflation because locals expect companies can offset rising costs by charging higher prices\n\nthe governments efforts have led some to be cautiously optimistic about the reopening initially i think there will be a moderate correction said natalia smirnova a financial adviser in moscow but i wouldnt rule out the possibility that the first day could end up with a modest increase\n\nrussia is a minnow of a financial market by global terms in december  the total market capitalization of companies listed on the moscow exchange was about  billion according to the world federation of exchanges which is just under  of the current value of tesla inc that made the moscow exchange the th largest bourse by market cap just above brazils b exchange in the wfes ranking of

they force the price down by selling tons of shares it seems like a risky gamble because what if it doesnt work and now they have even less shares\n\n i feel like when this idea gets brought up its always by people who have no experience working in the industry so how would they actually know it happens what if its just a conspiracy like oh the bad guys came and pushed down the price of my stock and thats why i lost money \n\ndoes anyone have links to interviews or youtube videos where industry people actually say this really happens no offense but if a person has never worked in the industry

"completion": "i worked at a relatively large options market maker as a trader and thought i would drop my two cents here fair warning my company mostly focused on commodities and futures in the big index funds \n\nfirst ill say it plainly there was never a time where the price of an underlying was purposefully manipulated in an attempt to avoid loses from the price of the underlying at my company this has happened before and been prosecuted the most high profile case that i know of being optivers hammer manipulating the price of oil  and it is very illegal there are cases though where from an outside perspective it can appear to happen that way in options markets specifically smaller markets think oil natural gas and agricultural products  there are often large participants putting through order flow that dominates not just one market maker but all market makers inventory this type of flow is typically initiated through direct brokers to market maker connections by doing it this way the customer putting on this large position is able to get more size at a better overall price than if they had traded it electronically or thats the idea  this then causes the entire position held by mms to be relatively similar because its being dominated by this big trade  where we begin to see effects on the price of the underlying is when we approach expiration close to one of the strikes with a huge position this reduction in time and relatively small difference between inventory position and underlying price causes the gamma of the options to increase and change very quickly  with this rising gamma and the assumption that most market makers dont want to hold any position causes them to start to hedge this hedging is in a direct relationship to the gamma they hold the strange behavior starts to arise when the entire mm group is short gamma in this area the situation starts to play out like this\n\n price of the underlying is  mms as a whole are short a large amount of gamma from shorts on the  strike \n the price of the underlying moves to  mm have picked up more a lot more short gamma and have accumulated negative deltas \n mms individually decide when their delta risk has become too great and buy the underlying to hedge this risk this pushes the price of the underlying up \n the price of the underlying is  and it is expiring in  hours mms have either hedged their delta one or multiple times driving the price up causing them to hedge more if they havent hedged they have huge short deltas more than likely dominating the risks in their book on top of this they are looking at pin risk of expiring near their short \n mms continue to hedge through  and push the price to  this causes their short gamma to decrease and forces them to sell the shares they bought on the way up driving the price back towards  \n\nthis type of situation is amplified by a small market where futures trade thinly creating competition for the available shares now in the case that you are the luck person or even better other mm who happened to avoid the massive trade earlier and can remain long gamma in that area you get the opposite effect and get to buy on the way up and sell on the way down aka gamma scalping the bottom line is from the outside it looks like the price is being forced to a certain price but its only that way because of individual action being taken by market makers with a similar position \n\nhope this helps feel free to drop questions if you have them [Sentiment: {'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.9648}] [Keywords:

my portfolio perpetually though im not reserved to make adjustments and sell when a i see an opportunity to take profits b my thesis changes my long term goal is passive income generation though i dont chase yields i dont pay much attention to valuation or macro as i think that since i plan on holding these stocks for decades while buying every month those dont matter to me much i invest regularly every month so im okay with buying at a higher valuation at times and lower valuation at other times in my opinion buying at the best possible time is more difficult than buying a good company that said if i see an undervalued stock i like i dont hesitate to buy more and when i make my regular contributions i try weigh towards stocks that might have been beaten down or seem undervalued my last review in one of these was  since then i have made some adjustments mostly by researching new companies and updating what i focus on when doing my analysis i am pretty comfortable with my current portfolio and can see myself holding any of these companies for decades that surely wont be the case but im okay with that not all of these will be good investments but most of them should i think\n\nmy goal is not doing  in a year or buying low and selling high my goal is to outperform the index modestly at maybe  annually which would compound very nicely over decades im okay with the risk that i underperform at a modest rate i want to avoid making drastic changes to my portfolio depending on macro environment\n\ni like stocks that are quality companies with\n\n\ta

barriers to entry  high switching costs supply chain etc i am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem almost every company i own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist\n\thigh margins i focus mostly on gross margin but consider other margin metrics too\n\tsustainable buybacks and dividend growth\n\tgreat

{"prompt": "i sold a company i created and after the press release went out i was inundated with very gracious offers to take and manage my new found money for fees at the time i presumed these wealth managers after managing hundreds of millions  if not billions  of other peoples money for decades would have developed advanced strategies and tactics for ensuring success surely they would have teams of analysts scouring the markets for opportunities technical indicators news events macroeconomic data and breakthrough innovations at all times to stay a step ahead of the pack i was dead wrong\n\nwhat i discovered was an antiquated industry that relied heavily on the belief that they knew better and were on top of things in fact there was very little effort that went into managing opm other peoples money and that most of the energy went to finding and onboarding new clients\n\nim not saying that their strategies were bad or didnt work i am only stating that they were neither complicated nor impressive in short anyone here could repeat the same strategies and save  of their money a year in perpetuity without further ado heres what i learned\n\ngoldman sachs\n\nits important to note that there are various divisions within gs wealth management that handle money differently i break it down into low net worth midnet worth and high net worth offerings the low net worth folks are given marcus an automated investment system that simply relies on etfs paired with some basic bond funds its the same as buying vanguard target retirement funds\n\nthe midnet worth offering is where i spent the bulk of time understanding they find  stocks to invest in from different sectors with an attempt to represent the sector weighting of the sp  as the spx is largely tech they are overweight technology basically they take the spy and cut it down from  companies to  companies\n\nwhy would they offer a less diverse array of stocks\n\nthey state as the reason that they are better able to manage  investments than  and since they are not trying to beat the returns of the index  their words  theyd rather find stocks with lower beta volatility and thus likely lower returns\n\nthey locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within the sp  once per quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments they target a  annual return after accounting for their  fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over a certain amount of money invested with them  this amounts to  per year for a m portfolio for many years  a lot of money to part with\n\ndid i mention you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them unless you happen to already own one of the  stocks they pick so there are tax consequences of getting involved\n\nfor the hnw folks the above offering is available and they offer additional products such as the ability to invest in private equity reits and hedge funds as you might imagine the more money they manage the more free accounting services they include\n\npersonal capital\n\nthis may actually be my favorite given the simplicity of it they take the main sector etfs and eliminate any stocks that are losing money to recreate their own etfs by sector they charge you a fee to use their etfs\n\nthey start with an equal amount of capital going to each sector etf but allocate more money to the sectors with the worst performance record from the year before they do this annually they do nothing all year\n\nthey charge a fee for managing your money i recall it being  or  basis points but you have to also pay to use their etfs so it creeps towards the better part of a percentage point very quickly and is much more expensive than simply buying a vanguard sp   fund or a group of the sector etfs calling it quits\n\nritholtz wealth management\n\nif youve watched cnbc regularly youd recognize the commentator josh brown  a partner of ritholtz wealth management hes the one with the thick new york city accent when i found out i may have the chance to have his insights managing my money i was excited as he always seemed so knowledgeable but the wealth management shop was not impressive\n\nin fact their model was exactly the same as that of goldman sachs they pick about  stocks stick your money in them rotate them every quarter and keep volatility low on the stocks they pick they target  annually net of fees yes you heard that correctly \n\nthe next group of wealth management shops all fell into one of three other categories spy collars etf aggregators or tactical investors\n\nspy collars\n\nthis strategy involved putting all of your money into the spy etf then selling call options on that investment out of the money a few months out at a time they take the income from the sale of these options and purchase out of the money puts on the spy for similar expiration dates this strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside for those who are not used to options heres how it works\n\nlets say the spy is trading at  you own it you sell someone else the right to buy it from you for  for  per call so long as the spy stays under  the other person will not execute the call and you get to keep the money for the call premium if the spy goes above  you have to either sell your shares at  plus pocket the  per call option premium making this a sale at  or buy the call back at a higher price than what you sold it for youd lose money on the call but the spy shares have gained in value so you still come out ahead you are just not as ahead as you would be had you simply bought and held the spy all the way to  this creates a ceiling in terms of the max amount you can obtain on the upside of your investment\n\nthe option puts work the other way protecting your investment on the way down since you used the premium collected on the sale of the call to buy the puts you havent spent any new money but have bought yourself insurance if the spy drops the value of your put option a short on your own investment increases this increase offsets your losses protecting you especially in the case of extreme correction\n\nif the spy rises you lose the value of your put so you have to account for that in your net income for the investment\n\nif you dont follow this dont worry the net effect is they

beating the market at the same time making it more difficult to execute\n\nc while we have analyzed the trends using the last  years worth of spy data the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say   or even  years\n\n \n\nconclusion\n\ni started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month i also checked for various time frames   years and various endpoints just before the covid crash after the crash before jpow etc in none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average joe in the total returns\n\nsince this is an optimization problem i am  in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive riskadjusted marketbeating returns\n\n \n\nfootnotes\n\n the data was obtained from yahoo finance api and longtermtrendsnet while the pe ratio was available for the last  years the daily closing of spy was limited to  years\n\n we are using the shiller pe ratio  this ratio divides the price of the sp  index by the average inflationadjusted earnings of the previous  years this solves for the brief period in  when the normal pe ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis\n\n we are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the tbonds\n\n the  cutoff is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends\n\n the idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from jp morgan which stated that  of the best days in the market happened within  days of the worst ones", "completion": "how

{"prompt": "by now we have all heard the virtues of dollarcost averaging dca and that you should never try to time the market basically it has been repeated ad nauseam that\n\ntime in the market beats timing the market\n\nbut what is interesting is that i could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollarcost averaging\n\ntheoretically there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hardearned money once a month into spy right\n\nso in this weeks analysis we will explore various methods to do dca and see which one would end up giving you the best returns\n\n \n\nanalysis\n\ngiven that dollarcost averaging is about holding investments longterm we need data lots and lots of data for this i have pulled the adjusted daily closing price  shiller pe ratio of spy for the last  years \n\nnow we have to devise different methods to do the dollarcost averaging that will maximize our longterm return we will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles all of them would be investing the same amount   every month but following different strategies\n\naverage joe invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending this would be our benchmark\n\ncautious charlie invests in the market only if the price to earnings ratio  is lesser than the last year rolling average else will hold treasurybills \n\nbalanced barry invests in the market only if the price to earnings ratio is within   of the last year rolling average else will hold tbills\n\nanalyst alan invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last alltime high else will hold tbills \n\ngiven that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment i have considered the starting point to be st jan  so the analysis is based on someone who invested  every month since  in all the above strategies we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied ie in the case of cautious charlie he will keep on accumulating tbills every month if the pe ratio is not within his set limit once its below the limit he will convert all the tbills and invest them into spy \n\n\n\nresults\n\nbased on the time period of our analysis we would have invested a total amount of  till now\n\nreturn comparison  different dca strategies \n\ninvestment strategyportfolio

amount of returns were made by the average joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending a close second was analyst alan who accumulated money in tbills and only invested when the market dropped more than  from its alltime high\n\nthe least amount of returns were generated by cautious charlie who only invested if the pe ratio was lesser than the last year average basically by trying to avoid overvalued rallies he ended up missing on all the gains followed by the analyst alan persona who waited for a  drop from ath before investing\n\n\n\nlimitations\n\nthere are some

{"prompt": "i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them\n\nfirst and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options\n\nthere are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised\n\n \n\nnow the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information\n\nas for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price\n\n \n\ni know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario\n\nwhether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay\n\ntime decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay\n\ntime decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches\n\ntheta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support\n\n \n\nalthough time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling\n\nthe reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post\n\nregardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time\n\nmaybe after this youll see why i stick to trading stocks rather than

{"prompt": "i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them\n\nfirst and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options\n\nthere are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised\n\n \n\nnow the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information\n\nas for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price\n\n \n\ni know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario\n\nwhether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay\n\ntime decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay\n\ntime decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches\n\ntheta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support\n\n \n\nalthough time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling\n\nthe reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post\n\nregardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their

the big potential returns\n\nhope this was helpful let me know what ya think", "completion": "great post by the original poster one aspect he did not touch on is the fact that all the pieces that go into the value of an option act like exponential curves why is this important to understand\n\nlets start with theta or time value theta decay is not linear if we compare an april and july option of the same strike the value of the option will drop more tomorrow in the april option than it will in the july option in fact there is virtually no theta decay in the july option right now theta decay really becomes important to consider  days before expiration\n\nin my trading i prefer to trade in options  days out it will cost me more to own that theta but it also gives me the chance to change my mind in the first few weeks without losing theta value this is a more conservative approach i use options to generate small incremental returns or to add some profit opportunity to core positions when i think a news item might move the stock sharply\n\nthe next variable to consider is called delta  this variable measures the rate of change expected in the option relative to the underlying stock price if i buy a  strike call on a stock trading at  the option should rise  for each  rise in the stock  this is called delta  in the industry the one is shorthand for  or   the option price change will reflect  of the stock price change delta  means  optimally you want an option that goes from delta  or  to delta  with  days left before expiration you get the benefit of the share price move and preserve some theta value you can recapture in the sale  unfortunately there are no freely available tools that will tell you the delta of a particular option without them you have to just feel it out but a good rule of thumb is a  differential is roughly delta  and a  differential is probably delta  ie the option is not going to budge much even if the stock moves \n\nyou will get the most out of an option if you can play those periods where the delta is increasing rapidly take that  stock again lets buy a call option with a  strike price if the stock goes to  the option will not move much as the stock rises more the option will react more this is how you can make a very high rate of return on options that  strike premium will make the option quite cheap maybe a  depending on the other variable if the stock gets to  that option is probably close to  triple your money\n\nthe last important variable is vol short for volatility a stock that has large frequent swings is more likely to hit any given strike price than a slowmoving stock traders price the options differently as a result in bull markets general stock market vol declines which generally means that individual stock vol declines as well on average but if markets start behaving dramatically stock option values increase as this vol becomes more valuable this is why having some puts in your portfolio after strong bull markets might make sense puts increase in prices as stocks fall and as vol increases its a double payday\n\nthe value of an option is largely the sum of these three variables theta is a cost you have to just accept the higher the delta in an option the less risk you have of losing everything at the cost of muchreduced upside since changes in vol are very hard to predict it is really just a bonus

{"prompt": "i failed a lot while trading before during and after succeeding i havent counted it up but its likely i encountered losses in excess of  from making mistakes that were easily avoided rash decisions and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies net net im up  but i was asked to share some of what worked for me over im quite a bit after my last post and figured id lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way as i did \n\nthese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation  someone trying to increase net worth not increase income  and they may not be suitable for everyone\n\nunderstand the trading environment\n\none mistake i made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment i was in before picking out a strategy what do i mean i need to know where things are in the year in relation to earnings season and in relation to sector rotations i need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and i need to watch the vix\n\nmind the gap between earnings seasons i cant stress this enough when earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in investors watch those like hawks good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market \n\nin between earnings seasons there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation year bond yields and what the fed is doing this makes for a much jumpier market thats more likely to pull back  its also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios they manage billions so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class eg value stocks energy and underweight in other asset classes eg growth stocks technology\n\ni try not to get caught by these patterns i anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly simply put i buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule of course i dont do this if i expect a terrible earnings season \n\ntake advantage of sector rotations\n\nthe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year i do this by plotting sector etfs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside if i run the pe ratios for the sector etfs i can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over  pe vs other sectors that are more modestly valued just keep in mind that certain sectors like tech will always be valued more richly given their growth so looking at pe ratios is not apples to apples  its just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range\n\nlast years worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year this is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high i dont bet against this trend its been around longer than i have and will continue to be around long after im dirt \n\nlast year you couldnt give away a barrel of oil last week oil reached  a barrel \n\none of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector etfs that underperformed the previous year i buy calls with expirations in  months knowing that i will sell at my exit point which for me is a  gain sometimes this happens  weeks into the year other times it takes  months so long as i dont overpay for the options it works i dont like to pay more than the average price return of the sector for example if the sector etf averages a  annual return and the etf price is  im not going to buy a call for more than  that way if the sector only moves  i can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough\n\nmake the vix your friend\n\nthe vix is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks if the vix goes up the market is worried if it goes down the market is getting bullish if it stays up everyone is on edge its hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button so be careful buying during times when the vix is high on the flip side if the market has pulled back and the vix starts to retreat away from its highs that makes for a good entry point \n\nanother interesting phenomenon is when the vix is higher than normal there tends to be a selloff the friday before a long weekend this happens because investors dont want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their tuesday with losses piling up ive found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day friday or to run some weekly puts on thursday afternoon before the dips \n\nselecting trades  investments\n\nhave an allocation plan\n\nthe first thing i recommend is determining in advance the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies anything shorter term is higher risk higher reward i break my portfolio in the following buckets\n\n  longterm market investment using equity etfs that largely track the spx or do a breakdown between bonds and the market i use vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called calf i will not touch this money for  years\n  cash i like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare this way if a black swan event happens i not only have money to invest i have money to live on should things go bad for a while this philosophy enabled me to buy options when covid hit in  without worrying if i could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job its also very useful if i have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions i took this from buffet fwiw\n  options mostly in tax advantaged accounts iras i aim for a  annual return overall with this portfolio though it fluctuates a lot year to year\n  long term blue chips stocks like visa apple msft etc i defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them andor buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur that can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls \n  longterm bets in a roth ira these are equities i think all have a chance at a x return but that will take  years its a lot of ipos small tech companies and biotechs i have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of  on the belief that a few of the  in here will more than compensate for it this is a new strategy for me so ill let you know in  years if it works\n  leveraged hedgesthese are puts on my own positions stocks or the market at large generally i use vix calls buy puts occasionally buy calls on the spxs and run strangles on investments betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts  \n  in other things i cant mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe\n\nuse technologies to find ideas\n\nunless you want to spend  hours a day reading news or are ok getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends you need to use tools to help you locate investmenttrade ideas and be willing to pay for them i value my time and am willing to pay  of my portfolio a year if it saves me time and more if it generates higher returns \n\nive tried about a dozen or so services including stock picking services like fool and investorsplace ultimately i decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because i did not want to wait  years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps so i switched to analytics tools and my fidelity platform \n\nmy favorite tools to use are zacks vgm score levelfields and fidelity the zacks vgm measures a stocks value growth rate and momentum its an easy screen i can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at the caveat

you trade often and how often you can be up  then down to  on the same positions which makes me want to break things  \nif you find yourself up huge on an equity investment switch to options i did this for my baba position and it saved me when it hit  i was up  i sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares i had about k in stock and switched to something like k in

{"prompt": "i failed a lot while trading before during and after succeeding i havent counted it up but its likely i encountered losses in excess of  from making mistakes that were easily avoided rash decisions and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies net net im up  but i was asked to share some of what worked for me over im quite a bit after my last post and figured id lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way as i did \n\nthese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation  someone trying to increase net worth not increase income  and they may not be suitable for everyone\n\nunderstand the trading environment\n\none mistake i made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment i was in before picking out a strategy what do i mean i need to know where things are in the year in relation to earnings season and in relation to sector rotations i need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and i need to watch the vix\n\nmind the gap between earnings seasons i cant stress this enough when earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in investors watch those like hawks good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market \n\nin between earnings seasons there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation year bond yields and what the fed is doing this makes for a much jumpier market thats more likely to pull back  its also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios they manage billions so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class eg value stocks energy and underweight in other asset classes eg growth stocks technology\n\ni try not to get caught by these patterns i anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly simply put i buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule of course i dont do this if i expect a terrible earnings season \n\ntake advantage of sector rotations\n\nthe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year i do this by plotting sector etfs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside if i run the pe ratios for the sector etfs i can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over  pe vs other sectors that are more modestly valued just keep in mind that certain sectors like tech will always be valued more richly given their growth so looking at pe ratios is not apples to apples  its just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range\n\nlast years worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year this is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high i dont bet against this trend its been around longer than i have and will continue to be around long after im dirt \n\nlast year you couldnt give away a barrel of oil last week oil reached  a barrel \n\none of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector etfs that underperformed the previous year i buy calls with expirations in  months knowing that i will sell at my exit point which for me is a  gain sometimes this happens  weeks into the year other times it takes  months so long as i dont overpay for the options it works i dont like to pay more than the average price return of the sector for example if the sector etf averages a  annual return and the etf price is  im not going to buy a call for more than  that way if the sector only moves  i can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough\n\nmake the vix your friend\n\nthe vix is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks if the vix goes up the market is worried if it goes down the market is getting bullish if it stays up everyone is on edge its hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button so be careful buying during times when the vix is high on the flip side if the market has pulled back and the vix starts to retreat away from its highs that makes for a good entry point \n\nanother interesting phenomenon is when the vix is higher than normal there tends to be a selloff the friday before a long weekend this happens because investors dont want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their tuesday with losses piling up ive found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day friday or to run some weekly puts on thursday afternoon before the dips \n\nselecting trades  investments\n\nhave an allocation plan\n\nthe first thing i

strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like gme and tsla my typical goal is to make  a week from these plays which i use to fund new call positions\n\nbe wary of analyst opinions\n\nif youve invested actively for a while youve likely noticed a peculiar trend as a stock is cratering analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it this is not for your benefit brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts so there is inherent bias in the system \n\nive also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings they are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks one study found less than  issued sell recommendations whats more the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping cnbc has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms eg goldman sachs says these  stocks are ready to explode but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right \n\ni am embarrassed to say i lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality its easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if  analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect which is tradable but it boils down to needing to do your own research\n\ngood things come in pairs\n\njust about every stock has a peer or competitor most have several i stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders ive owned visa and mastercard i own olo and tost i have a handful of um herbal medicine providers i like etsy and amzn if you bet on a small group of competitors its likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially \n\nsimilarly it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy what do i mean if mastercard reports low cross border transactions its highly probable visa will be experiencing the same thing so you can use the information from mastercard to alter your position on visa\n\nexercise financial discipline\n\neven when ive been successful picking investments ive run into problems with how to handle my successes weve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go thats usually the moment ive learned i should be taking some gains a few rules i try hard to follow but still screw up\n\n take profits often   \nwhen an option or stock hits  return i look to take some profit it may not seem possible if you only bought  call but it is just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return you can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up this ensures you cannot lose money my rationale here is simple at a  gain i now have more to lose than i have to gain you will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up  then down to  on the same positions which makes me want to break things  \nif you find yourself up huge on an equity investment switch to options i did this for my baba position and it saved me when it hit  i was up  i sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares i had about k in stock and switched to something like k in options when baba crashed down to  i really didnt care much i was only down k instead of k i had my profit of k locked in so being down k was no big deal  \n\n fail fast   \nif the option price sinks to  in value its likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to praying is not a strategy the other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as i wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date if theres negative news driving this im out i want to fail quickly that allows me time to take the remaining  and generate gains with it on a better investment i think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as i tend to be an optimist  \n\n profit both ways   \nif a stock i hold hits an alltime high in price or valuation i look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts this enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave i hold visa and when it hit  headed into earnings i sold  calls and bought  puts this offset a paper loss for me of k yesterday alone by k in gains which i secured as real profits assuming visa will recover that k adds  to this years returns for visa  \n\n be patient but not greedy   \ni have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea especially if using good tools asset managers wealth managers and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every  months not daily so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness example i held upstart from april to august this year and sold it because it was running flat a couple weeks later the stock tripled fml were the only words i could think of at the time the second thought i had was that i shouldve bought just one call option to replace the stock i sold  \non the flip side once a stock does move a lot higher dont be greedy what goes up fast can come down just as fast i feel a lot worse watching a stockoption go up  then come down all the way or more than i do exiting with a  gain watching the stock go up more dont chase the perfect trade its a white whale just make money  \n\n everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth   \nthis is as true in boxing thanks mike as it is investing thats why its essential to have a plan a and a plan b should plan a not work out as you thought waiting through it can work but it isnt a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment   \nso if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising covid rates and covid rates stop rising i try to have plan b ready i keep a lot of notes i track every trade i review what went wrong with trades quarterly i learn i avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest i try not to fall in love with any stock and i know that even if i lose k theres more money to be made in the coming years and decades if i stick it out", "completion": "let me summarize\n\n you had capital\n encountered a pandemic [Sentiment: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0,

said he just would love to see a clear policy on the matter\n\nbecause mr powell didnt dismiss the idea investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as tilray brands inc a leading producer tilray went public the following month and its stock skyrocketed\n\nin early september  ms weis husband bought between  and  million of tilray shares according to her disclosure form and the fed the stock continued to surge\n\nit then became clear that neither the fed nor the treasury would take action it would be up to congress with no quick fix in sight in october shares of cannabis

those reported  tradesinvolved shorting stocks or betting on a fall in their price they ranged from amazon to ford motor co to zoom video communications inc the cftc said all the short sales were made by her husband\n\nover the years to safeguard the cftcs integrity congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees investing in amending the commodity exchange act congress also declared that any breach by a cftc employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a  fine and five years in prison the cftcs role doesnt include regulating stocks but in  the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families\n\nnonetheless a cftc ethics official approved short selling by ms mcphails husband joseph mcphail a cftc spokesman said fearing that the commission could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no the spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commissions statutory authority\n\nmr mcphail referred questions to the cftc the cftc spokesman said he didnt speak for the mcphails ms mcphail didnt respond to requests for comment\n\nat the cftc employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the cftc to oversee markets is free from any conflict of

chinese stocks even as the pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering china\n\nacross the federal government more than  officials owned or traded chinese company stocks including officials at the state department and white house the journal found their investments amounted to between  million and  million on average a year\n\nreed werner while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast asia in december  reported a purchase of between  and  of stock in alibaba group holding ltd\n\nat the time discussions were under way at the pentagon over whether to add the chinese ecommerce giant to a list of companies in which americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the chinese government\n\ndefense and state officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist while the treasury feared this would have wide capitalmarkets ramifications mr werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about

transactions he said he wasnt involved in policymaking decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didnt see a conflict between his job and investments he left the government in july  before mr trump signed the executive order barring americans from investing in certain chinese companies\n\nwithin federal agencies ethics officials generally dont consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs ethics officials ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually dont know what employees are working on\n\nwhen ethics officials do see a potential violation they can refer it to their agencies inspectors general who refer cases on to the justice department if they find evidence of wrongdoing\n\na journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts as more federal officials invest in the stock market ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing when findings have been referred to the justice department prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation\n\none matter at the securities and exchange commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouses financial holdings and trades for at least seven years the trades included stocks that sec employees and their families werent allowed to own some of which the sec inspector general determined posed a conflict with the officials work according to a report the inspector general provided to congress\n\nwhen a us attorney declined to prosecute the secs inspector general reported the findings to sec management the unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up  hours of leave time\n\nthe sec declined to comment a justice department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said we take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring

that have a direct and predictable effect on their investments and those of family members\n\nwhen the ethics officials contacted mr molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms they were told he didnt have any influence over environmental policy\n\nhis duties are administrative in nature his boss the epas chief of staff at the time told the ethics officials he provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect on his financial interests the chief of staff said according to mr molinas financial disclosure\n\nin his time at the epa mr molina clashed with ethics officials many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy according to epa emails reviewed by the journal at one point he didnt file accurate monthly trading disclosures for  months according to the epa emails mr molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports as required\n\nethics officials said they contacted mr molina scores of times to press him to file timely reports according to the emails reviewed by the journal\n\nin one

it to someone and hoping to buy it back at a lower price your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price ill provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex\n\n person a is a share lender they want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation\n person b asks person a to lend him that share temporarily person b does not pay anything upfront but he promises to pay person a in the form of interest over time\n person b finds a buyer person c person c wants to buy a stock so it can go up person c is long on this stock person b however is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down\n person c pays person b  for the stock now person c has spent  and person b has gained \u00a0\n two hypothetical situation happens now\n    scenario  stock value increases to  person c is now up  and he sells because hes making nice gains person b needs to buy back that share at  but he only gained  profit initially now he needs to fork up  to buy back the share and then return the share back to the lender  any interest accrued in this scenario the short lost money the long gained money and the lender made interest money\u00a0\n    scenario  stock value decreases to  person c is now down  and he sells to cut losses person b needs to buy back that share at  but he already has  in profit initially now he pays  for the share leaving him still with  profit and returns the share back to the lender  any interested accrued in this scenario the short made money the long lost money and the lender made interest money\u00a0\n the above scenarios help to show why shorts typically hedge funds or experienced traders might want to manipulate the stock price to go down hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market which i will explain in a bit and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves shorts therefore have the opposite intention of longs they want share prices to go down and in the process can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat in other words when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt grow the business develop new products pay for expenses etc\u00a0\n\nmarket manipulation\n\nmarket manipulation is not new to the scene investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics and every day we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks specific categories or industries of stocks or the entire market market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator in this case these are the wealthy whales or hedge funds both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds keep in mind not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are shorts some are neutral and act as lenders to make money some are growthbased and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices and others are short which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch below i will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales\n\nmanipulation tactics on a spectrum\n\nmarket manipulation can happen in certain stock sectors or the entire market there are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know but i will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it\n\nscenario \n\nlets say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock x stock x is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value so they can hedge or protect themselves by selling put options when they sell puts they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration but on the contrary they will be collecting the premium or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put at the same time this hedge fund will slowly cover or buy shares of stock x so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money the manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover if they want to add another level of manipulation to this they can also purchase call options which will result in profit if the stock price goes up in this scenario hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy\n\nscenario \n\nlets say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock x stock x is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock this hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position by buying shares selling put options or buying call options so they try a different route keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops take for example if apple and google began to hurl downwards this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss this in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly conveniently enough hedge funds own a lot of these big name fang stocks\n\n\u00a0if i am a moderately sadistic hedge fund i can sell off a large holding of shares in the scale of multi millions or billions that are in the same sector as stock x which would incite fear across the sector creating panic sell offs the price will drop sharply across the board including stock x and the short position will produce big profits because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price they can now cover their short position essentially getting rid of it and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier only this time at a much cheaper price the hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again this can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades publicizing newly purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it etc\u00a0\n\nscenario \n\nthis one involves technology algorithm trading commonly referred to as algo trading this one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around algorithm trading is the process of using highspeed supercomputers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise in this case the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market which makes this  legal how this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made for you general investors we have mobile apps and webbased trading platforms to trade when we like a stock we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol the amount of shares the price we are willing to pay hit submit and confirm the trade for hedge funds using algorithm trading all this is done autonomously which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker when an order is submitted it goes through a brokerage fidelity webull etrade tda rh etc and the data is rerouted to a clearing house intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled but they take it on a first come first serve basis so if a stock is moving quickly hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster\u00a0\n\nalgorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios which is why they can almost guarantee profit algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability and it acts on various factors such as volatility volume interest activity news etc in some cases these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things ill start by talking about market orders vs limit orders before you make a trade on your brokerage you will notice an option that says market order or limit order market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time there is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time there may not be anyone selling at a good price and instead some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices for example some people set a sell limit at  for gme if you did a market order and you get really unlucky you might end up snagging a share for  each when the actual share value might be  however when you set a limit order you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated\u00a0\n\nin the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit remember when they buy or sell its processed significantly faster at the clearing houses so if youre that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves moral of the story do not purchase as market order  always purchase at limit

{"prompt": "this journey began for me with a random conversation i was at a grocery store on my break from work and while i was looking at different greek yogurts i overheard a man say something i couldnt believe i turned around and said sir im sorry what did you just say he introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store locally owned in stpeteclearwater fl area the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around  for a crate of foodhe said one year later that same exact crate is now  this conversation was just  weeks ago \n\nsowhen i got into my car i had an idea i wonder what the us dollar index is trading atim sure its bloody red i assumed what i saw literally made my jaw drop im not jokingat that time the us dollar happened to be at a  month high i couldnt fucking believe it at that moment i knewwe had fucked up \n\nafter already doing mini dd on why the us dollar might fall just days before just watching random videos on youtube about dr burry and stock shit \n\ni immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation which was call options in tbt an etf with x inverse exposure on  us treasury bonds in simple terms this is a bet on hyperinflation i believe that the federal reserve will be forced to raise rates as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation faster than anyone is anticipating which in turn would collapse bond prices making the calls print i currently have a small position right now\n\nthe dollar index after j pows jackson hole speech  \n\nnow this brings me to the us stock market i sold all my stocks  days ago i have long exposure in only one position currently a  call debit spread in viac simply put if im wrong and the market just keeps going then the  i paid for spread will generate nearly  if viac is over  on expiration which is in  years\n\n                  technical analysis\n\nlet me start with my ta firstwhich is alarming  \n\nthis was yesterday friday september \n\nhere is one from thursday september \n\n\n\nspy is at a critical resistance leveli meanit literally is hitting the fucking roof here and with everything going on in the worldyou want more sorry to burst your bubblebut how was that even theoretically feasible its impossible in my opinion \n\nlet me explain why\n\n              updated gdp forecasts\n\nam i literally the only one who saw on thursday that morgan stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter gdp expectations let me fill you in on a little secretthey cut their fucking estimates by more than half\n\nfor fuck sakes people this is huge this is a quote from a brand new article literally posted  minutes ago from the washington post \n\nthe team at morgan stanley led by chief us economist ellen zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to  from \n\ngross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the united states soyeah were fucked which in turn has an impact on some companies future earnings and we all know that wall street has extremely high expectations now \n\n             wall streets high expectations\n\nso far  of s and p  companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of  according to data provider factset\n\nthe strong results put the s and p  on track to be the best quarter for beats since factset started tracking the data in   so what happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen you could have a slow correction based on this alone just on companies missing earningswhich i guarantee that will happen its going to be an earnings miss galore \n\n                     lumbergold ratio\n\nsimply put when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth\n\nwhen gold goes down safe haven assest less risk that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive\n\nso investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio\n\nthis ratio calculates how many contracts of lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold\n\nget it good now feast your eyes on this   \n\ni like this one better compared to the dow  \n\n\nthe lumbergold ratio has plummeted in the last  monthsliterally fucking straight down which is a key indicator for an upcoming correctioncrash rememberplay defense\n\nside note lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation butgold was up big this week as welland say prayers for the people suffering from hurricane ida\n\n                consumer confidence\n\nin simple terms increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money indicating higher consumption\n\nsofor the month of july the conference board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about  households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability business conditions and overall economic situation\n\nthey reported  on the index for the month of july boywere they in for a surprise the month of august has a consensus estimate of  the number was a very surprising miss i wasnt surprised at all to be honest with you\n\n\n                      conclusion\n\nlet me be cleari believe jerome powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus its going to collapse our financial system possiblyalso with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm also with rising delta concerns the new variant mu and mass evictions will soon begin\n\nsince the start of   the spy has hit  all time highs this is more than the epic run from  where spy hit  all time highs\n\nno big deal right \n\n\nthis is a chart of the total assets held in all federal reserve banks \n\nno big deal right\nbrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\n\nmedian american home prices have now surpassed the  housing bubble peak \n\nno big deal right \n\ni mean for fucks sakes i literally could go on and on but you get the point by nowlets not forget the craziness in the middle east right now massive devastating storms crippling our country rising food costs im sure gas will be very high soon also

{"prompt": "fellow bettors if you understand options move on\n\nfirst proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday  truly phenomenal\n\nive noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately dont know what options are or what they do  this is incredibly concerning how are we going to get to the moon if we dont know how to build a rocket  as such ive decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer younger or less experienced traders as a christmas present to the sub if you know what options are move on  im going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible  a reference guide\n\nas much as we all like loss porn i like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savingstuition moneyinheritance because they come to the sub and dont know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a  dte  out of the money call with everything they have  gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table\n\ndepending on feedback i may write a few more  if i get told to fuck off i completely understand but if some people learn some stuff then ill continue  i will be using msft as my example\n\n what are options\n    the basicsbuying vs selling options\n    the money\n    calls explained\n       buying calls\n       selling naked calls\n    puts explained\n       buying puts\n       selling naked puts\n options pricing\n    intrinsic value\n    extrinsic value\n do i have to hold to expiration\n the details\n the greeks\n helpful links\n\noptions explained\n\nthe basics\n\nbuying an option gives you the right to buy call or sell put  shares of a stock at a specific price strike price on or before the expiration date european options are specifically on the expiration date  buying calls is bullish buying puts is bearish  to buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade premium explained more later\n\n if you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day you buy calls\n if you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day you buy puts\n\nselling an option obligates you to buy put or sell call  shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option\n\n if you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price you sell calls\n if you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price you sell puts\n\nthe money\n\nfor calls\n\n at the money  a call with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n in the money  a call with a strike price below the current stock price can immediately be exercised\n out of the money  a call with a strike price above the current stock price  the stock must rise to or above the strike price to be exercised\n\nfor puts\n\n at the money  a put with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n in the money  a put with a strike price above the current stock price can immediately be exercised\n out of the money   a put with a strike price below the current strike price must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised\n\ncalls explained\n\nbuying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub and thus will be covered first  i will be using msft as my example stock  msft is currently trading at  and i believe that the sale of the new xbox around christmas time will increase the stock price to  by christmas  i would buy a call  i decide to look at the dec  options which you can see below\n\n\n\nthis is robinhood on a computer  at the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below\n\n strike price  the price the stock has to rise above to be exercised\n break even  the price the stock has to rise above to not lose money\n to break even  percent change in the stock required to break even\n  change  daily change in option price in percent\n change  daily change in option price in dollars\n price  price of the option\n\nin the above example\n\n  strike price  in the money could be immediately exercised but the buyerexerciser would experience a loss\n  strike price  out of the money could not be immediately exercised\n\nthe break even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk  this can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option  for the         the option can be exercised below the break even for a loss\n\nbuying calls\n\nok so the   strike is what we are going to buy that is  dollars per share for  shares so the buyer would pay a total of  for the trade depending on the bid  ask explained in the details below  we go ahead an buy that option for a debit of \n\nas the month goes on before  some things could happen\n\n msft goes up the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n msft goes down the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n msft trades sideways which will result in the value of the option decreasing explained in greeks\n\non  if you still hold the option there are a few possibilities\n\n msft is above the breakeven well say  you can sell the option for a profit which would be almost entirely intrinsic value the contract would be worth around        this is per share so your profit would be  x       the  is the debit paid for the contract\n msft is above the strike but below the breakeven well say   the contract will be very close to break even and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below  if you are still bullish on msft this is the only time i would recommend exercising the option to buy the share and only if you have the capital to do so  if you are bearish or do not have the capital your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss  in this case it would be around   note robinhood risk management will automatically sell options if you do not have the capital to exercise them and it is close to the strike on the day of expiration\n msft is below the strike hold or sell to avoid max loss  your max loss in the trade is  dollars and the stock may run up towards the end of the day  if msft finishes the day below the strike the option will expire worthless\n\nselling naked calls\n\nif you are neutral to bearish on msft because you think the ps will outsell the xbox you could sell the  c  see below\n\n\n\nnotice to break even turns into chance of profit  this is a calculation using the greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade  you sell this call  this would mean you would be credited with  dollars initially  as the month goes on if msft goes up in value you will begin to lose money on the trade and if you desired to close the trade you would have to buy to close meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for  if msft trades sideways or decreases in value the options contract will decrease and you can buy to close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on \n\nselling naked calls can be very risky  if you sell the call and msft shoots up the next day to  the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call  this means that you as the seller are obligated to sell them  shares of msft at   what happens if you dont have them you have to buy them at the current market price  so  x     you would then sell them for   your max loss on the trade will be        and that is only if the price goes to   if the price at expiration is  your max loss would be   for every  increase in underlying the max loss increases   to avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls to be discussed later\n\nputs explained\n\nbuying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub  msft is still  and i believe the new xbox sucks  i think the stock will fall to  on or before   below are  puts\n\n\n\nnone of the

option will decrease in value and you can buy to close for a profit at any time\n\nthe same risk applies to selling naked puts as naked calls but is capped as a stock cannot go below zero\n\noptions pricing\n\nthe price of an option has two different parts intrinsic and extrinsic value\n\n intrinsic value  current price  strike price\n    an out of the money option has no intrinsic value\n    an in the money option has an intrinsic value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price\n    example  msft price   for the  c this option has an intrinsic value of  for each share or   but you can see in figure  it is  or  dollars to buy  that is where extrinsic value comes into play\n extrinsic value\n    effected by theta and implied volatility\n    can be calculated by extrinsic value  option price  intrinsic value\n    theta\n       the more time an option has to expiration the higher it is priced  this is because the underlying stock msft has more time to move\n       the theta curve accelerates around the  day mark see the figure below  you can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value regardless of if it is in or out of the money it will depreciate\n\n\n\n implied volatility  a lot of math goes into this one but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time\n    steady stocks like ko tend to have lower iv\n    high growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher iv\n    the iv of each option will be different depending on expiration date how far in or out of the money the stock is and the movement of the underlying\n    iv crush  this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing  even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases decreasing the extrinsic value  be careful if you hold options over a stocks earnings\n\ndo i have to hold to expiration\n\nlets say we buy the msft  c  do we have to wait until december  no  if the underlying increases to lets say  by next friday  we could sell the option for likely a pretty good profit  we payed  for the contract but the price of the call may increase to  so we could sell to close for a  profit allowing us to move on to another trade  but as we approach the strike delta increases and therefore may be worth holding  the break even information is only if you intend to hold the call to expiration and profit from exercising and then immediately selling the shares back into the market  due to time and market craziness i recommend taking profit from the option itself rather than exercising and using the shares\n\nthe details\n\ngoing back to our out of the money  c on msft if you select the option you will open up the details surrounding that option  this can be seen below\n\nxb\n\n\n\nthis explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is from left to right\n\n bid  highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price\n ask  lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price\n mark  often in between the bid and ask what you see on the main options tree\n previous close  the price of the most recent option sold\n high  highest price paid during the trading day

settled\n\nbidask spread is the different between the bid and ask in this case   the closer the bid ask spread the more likely you are to get an order filled  slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock  if the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call by the time you enter the order the bidask spread might have moved up dramatically and your order might not get filled\n\nopen interest is important as well  if very low open interest selling or buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is\n\nthe lower the open interest and the wider the bidask spread is the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers  they will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bidask and will expect you to do it  if they are moving millions of options a day  is a lot to them and they will profit off of it\n\nthe greeks\n\nyou can see the greeks listed above for this call\n\n delta  how much an options price is expected to change for every  change in the underlying  calls have positive delta puts have negative delta  if msft goes from  to  the price of the option will increase   puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases  delta will approach  as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike causing a natural increase in intrinsic value\n gamma  the change in delta for every  change in the underlying  gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike\n theta  change in the option price for every  day closer to expiration  theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date  if you hold onto the  c for a day it would decrease in value  per contract so a total of   you can see how this is an options buyers enemy\n vega  how the implied volatility affects the price of the option  a drop in vega will

option gives you the right to buy call or sell put  shares of a stock at a specific price strike price on or before the expiration date european options are specifically on the expiration date  buying calls is bullish buying puts is bearish  to buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade premium explained more later\n\n if you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day you buy calls\n if you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day you buy puts\n\nselling an option obligates you to buy put or sell call  shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option\n\n if you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price you sell calls\n if you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price you sell puts\n\nthe money\n\nfor calls\n\n at the money  a call with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n in the money  a call with a strike price below the current stock price can immediately be exercised\n out of the money  a call with a strike price above the current stock price  the stock must rise to or above the strike price to be exercised\n\nfor puts\n\n at the money  a put with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n in the money  a put with a strike price above the current stock price can immediately be exercised\n out of the money   a put with a strike price below the current strike price must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised\n\ncalls explained\n\nbuying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub and thus will be covered first  i will be using msft as my example stock  msft is currently trading at  and i believe that the sale of the new xbox around christmas time will increase the stock price to  by christmas  i would buy a call  i decide to look at the dec  options which you can see below\n\n\n\nthis is robinhood on a computer  at the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below\n\n strike price  the price the stock has to rise above to be exercised\n break even  the price the stock has to rise above to not lose money\n to break even  percent change in the stock required to break even\n  change  daily change in option price in percent\n change  daily change in option price in dollars\n price  price of the option\n\nin the above example\n\n  strike price  in the money could be immediately exercised but the buyerexerciser would experience a loss\n  strike price  out of the money could not be immediately exercised\n\nthe break even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk  this can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option  for the         the option can be exercised below the break even for a loss\n\nbuying calls\n\nok so the   strike is what we are going to buy that is  dollars per share for  shares so the buyer would pay a total of  for the trade depending on the bid  ask explained in the details below  we go ahead an buy that option for a debit of \n\nas the month goes on before  some things could happen\n\n msft goes up the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n msft goes down the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n msft trades sideways which will result in the value of the option decreasing explained in greeks\n\non  if you still hold the option there are a few possibilities\n\n msft is above the breakeven well say  you can sell the option for a profit which would be almost entirely intrinsic value the contract would be worth around        this is per share so your profit would be  x       the  is the debit paid for the contract\n msft is above the strike but below the breakeven well say   the contract will be very close to break even and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below  if you are still bullish on msft this is the only time i would recommend exercising the option to buy the share and only if you have the capital to do so  if you are bearish or do not have the capital your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss  in this case it would be around   note robinhood risk management will automatically sell options if you do not have the capital to exercise them and it is close to the strike on the day of expiration\n msft is below the strike hold or sell to avoid max loss  your max loss in the trade is  dollars and the stock may run up towards the end of the day  if msft finishes the day below the strike the option will expire worthless\n\nselling naked calls\n\nif you are neutral to bearish on msft because you think the ps will outsell the xbox you could sell the  c  see below\n\n\n\nnotice to break even turns into chance of profit  this is a calculation using the greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade  you sell this call  this would mean you would be credited with  dollars initially  as the month goes on if msft goes up in value you will begin to lose money on the trade and if you desired to close the trade you would have to buy to close meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for  if msft trades sideways or decreases in value the options contract will decrease and you can buy to close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on \n\nselling naked calls can be very risky  if you sell the call and msft shoots up the next day to  the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call  this means that you as the seller are obligated to sell them  shares of msft at   what happens if you dont have them you have to buy them at the current market price  so  x     you would then sell them for   your max loss on the trade will be        and that is only if the price goes to   if the price at expiration is  your max loss would be   for every  increase in underlying the max loss increases   to avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls to be discussed later\n\nputs explained\n\nbuying

puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub  msft is still  and i believe the new xbox sucks  i think the stock will fall to  on or before   below are  puts\n\n\n\nnone of the metrics change except for what is in and out of the money\n\n   in the money can immediately be exercised but the buyerexerciser would experience a loss\n   out of the money cannot immediately be exercised\n\nbuying puts\n\nthe   strike is what we are going to buy so that is  for  shares so if purchased and filled this would cost us  dollars  note this is much more expensive than the  call this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price\n\nas the month goes on before  some things could happen\n\n msft goes down the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n msft goes up the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n msft trades sideways which will result in the value of the option decreasing\n\non  if you still hold the option there are a few possibilities\n\n msft is below the breakeven well say  you can sell the option for a profit which would be almost entirely intrinsic value worth around        again per share minus the debit would again get us around   notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration that is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher\n msft is below the strike price but above the breakeven well say   the contract will very throughout the day and unless you have the capital to exercise robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not\n msft is above the strike price you can sell to minimize profit or hold until it expires worthless\n\nselling naked puts\n\nif you are neutral to bullish on msft because you think the xbox will be meh you could sell the  p  this means you would be credited with   if msft decreases in value the option price will increase in value and you will lose money on the trade  you can hold to expiration or buy to close at any time for a loss  if msft trades sideways or increases in value the option will decrease in value and you can buy to close for a profit at any time\n\nthe same risk applies to selling naked puts as naked calls but is capped as a stock cannot go below zero\n\noptions pricing\n\nthe price of an option has two different parts intrinsic and extrinsic value\n\n intrinsic value  current price  strike price\n    an out of the money option has no intrinsic value\n    an in the money option has an intrinsic value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price\n    example  msft price   for the  c this option has an intrinsic value of  for each share or   but you can see in figure  it is  or  dollars to buy  that is where extrinsic value comes into play\n extrinsic value\n    effected by theta and implied volatility\n    can be calculated by extrinsic value  option price  intrinsic value\n    theta\n       the more time an option has to expiration the higher it is priced  this is because the underlying stock msft has more time to move\n       the theta curve accelerates around the  day mark see the figure below  you can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value regardless of if it is in or out of the money it will depreciate\n\n\n\n implied volatility  a lot of math goes into this one but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time\n    steady stocks like ko tend to have lower iv\n    high growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher iv\n    the iv of each option will be different depending on expiration date how far in or out of the money the stock is and the movement of the underlying\n    iv crush  this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing  even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases decreasing the extrinsic value  be careful if you hold options over a stocks earnings\n\ndo i have to hold to expiration\n\nlets say we buy the msft  c  do we have to wait until december  no  if the underlying increases to lets say  by next friday  we could sell the option for likely a pretty good profit  we payed  for the contract but the price of the call may increase to  so we could sell to close for a  profit allowing us to move on to another trade  but as we approach the strike delta increases and therefore may be worth holding  the break even information is only if you intend to hold the call to expiration and profit from exercising and then immediately selling the shares back into the market  due to time and market craziness i recommend taking profit from the option itself rather than exercising and using the shares\n\nthe details\n\ngoing back to our out of the money  c on msft if you select the option you will open up the details surrounding that option  this can be seen below\n\nxb\n\n\n\nthis explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is from left to right\n\n bid  highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price\n ask  lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price\n mark  often in between the bid and ask what you see on the main options tree\n previous close  the price of the most recent option sold\n high  highest price paid during the trading day for the option\n low  lowest price paid during the trading day for the option\n volume  number of contracts traded during the trading day\n open interest  number of total contracts not settled\n\nbidask spread is the different between the bid and ask in this case   the closer the bid ask spread the more likely you are to get an order filled  slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock  if the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call by the time you enter the order the bidask spread might have moved up dramatically and your order might not get filled\n\nopen interest is important as well  if very low open interest selling or buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is\n\nthe lower the open interest and the wider the bidask spread is the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers  they will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bidask and will expect you to do it  if they are moving millions of options a day  is a lot to them and they will profit off of it\n\nthe greeks\n\nyou can see the greeks listed above for this call\n\n delta  how much an options price is expected to change for every  change in the underlying  calls have positive delta puts have negative delta  if msft goes from  to  the price of the option will increase   puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases  delta will approach  as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike causing a natural increase in intrinsic value\n gamma  the change in delta for every  change in the underlying  gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike\n theta  change in the option price for every  day closer to expiration  theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date  if you hold onto the  c for a day it would decrease in value  per contract so a total of   you can see how this is an options buyers enemy\n vega  how the implied volatility affects the price of the option  a drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value  compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying  again be cautious of iv crush around earnings\n rho  sensitivity to interest rates has to do with the us treasury you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least\n\nhelpful links\n\nhere are some awesome links that will

{"prompt": "xb\n\n\n\nthe more things change the more they stay the same there is nothing new under the sun\n\nxb\n\nin every market bubble you always hear the same language the same rationalizations the same absurd arguments these people think they are offering some new unique insight in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history lets address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis\n\nxb\n\n interest rates are low nowhere for money to go except stocks\n\nwhen you really drill down into it this is some bizarre logic its essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable in other words its a manifestation of the greedy fear of missing out mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles\n\nultimately these bull arent even arguing that we arent in a bubble they are arguing we are in a bubble but that the bubble is justified\n\nthe obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a lowinterest rate environment whats the worst that can happen if i sit on a pure cash portfolio i lose  per year not good of course but not the end of the world either whats the worst that can happen if i dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes i lose  of my funds in as little as a month ouch\n\nthe idea that im forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing  a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset\n\nof course the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply wont crash or that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious but the whole point is that the crash is never obvious especially to permabulls they see a dip and they buy it they see a deeper dip what a great opportunity so they buy more and before they realize the dip isnt simply a dip they are already fucked tale as old as time\n\nthe funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational why hold cash when bonds pay more why buy bonds when index funds pay more why buy index funds when spacs pay more why buy spacs when flipping cocaine pays more after all if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since it loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify\n\nwhats most interesting is that this argument isnt even new the ridiculously low interest rates set by the fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the  crash the fed is ultimately a bubble creator something even wsb is well aware of\n\n if you sit out this rally you will end up behind even if you are right\n\nthis is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls they argue that if you sat out the last  months something this is essentially a straw man argument except in reference to permabears then you would have missed out on massive gains and therefore the implicit argument is you can never sit out\n\nif you carefully analyze this argument you will realize it is literally nothing more than fear of missing out to the extreme its fear of missing out disguised as macroeconomic theory i have to stay in the market perpetually i can never sit out because if i do i will miss out on gains and you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy\n\nfirst of all i will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately permabears people who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains but not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are permabears there are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed\n\nan intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear they adapt to the market and when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid permabear the bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out\n\nxb\n\nlets take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history\n\nxb\n\nmajor indicators of the great bubble\n\nxb\n\n massive retail investment worldwide\n\nwhat are some signs of bubbles historically well a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market do we have that today check on fucking steroids weve got people who cant change a fucking tire on their  civic downloading robinhood and gambling options on margin like what the fuck\n\nthe  iq mongoloid who was washing dishes at papa johns last tuesday do they even have dishes i dont fucking know is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking china or some shit are you kidding me do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching\n\nnot to mention the entire shortsqueeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in bangladesh is downloading robinhood to buy calls on fucking sndl or whatever the fuck\n\npast us market bubbles were largely restricted to the us population it was mostly americans buying american stocks during the dotcom boom but wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into tesla at a  pe ratio whats that noise is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance\n\nthe max pain theory which is ironically popular among permabulls argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors this is of course bullshit but its food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo\n\n\n\n ridiculously speculative investments aka spacs\n\ncciv is worth  billion dollars and it owns literally nothing no deal is in place no announced deal figures have been offered obviously the spac has no earnings or revenue to speak of just  billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium i can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed\n\nwhat is a spac at the end of the day a rich guy steps up and says give me your money and ill decide what ill do with it in a few months\n\nand a million retards step up and say sounds great take my money\n\ntell me this spac shit isnt exactly like the dotcom boom when literally anything with a com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the hot new thing there is no way this spac mania lasts and lots of people will be hurt in the end\n\n\n\n options volume absolutely exploding\n\noptions are becoming the vehicle of choice for investors aka gamblers in the current market stock represents actual ownership of a company the foundation of the actual market but what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term i just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker\n\nthe question i sometimes ask is how much of this market growth is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume you know like derivative cdos leveraging worthless mortgages back in  its something to think about\n\nill just leave this chart here since it makes the case for me this is neither natural nor sustainable\n\n\n\n greater fool logic\n\nill just quote investopedia since im getting lazy here\n\nthe greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date this is because there will always be someone ie a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price\n\nif acting in accordance with the greater fool theory an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality if the theory holds the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another greater fool who could also be hoping to flip them quickly unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices\n\nthe greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions in  when investors purchased faulty mortgagebacked securities it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed\n\nbasically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value this is talking about you\n\n\n\n buffet indicator through the roof\n\nthe buffet indicator has reach its highest ever level for noobies who dont know what this means the buffett indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by us gdp a very high buffett indicator suggests an overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom\n\nthere are two arguments against the buffett indicator as a useful metric the first argument is that gdp is a backward indicator and therefore doesnt account for future growth while this is true it misses the entire point the point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles the point is to tie market valuations to some realworld metric which is necessarily backward looking\n\nthe other argument against the buffett indicator which holds more weight is that us stocks consist of global companies and therefore arent adequately represented by us gdp\n\ni will say these people have a good point but they are also missing several nuances within gdp and market valuations which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post suffice it to say the buffett indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation and cant simply be discarded\n\n\n\n valuations divorced from reality\n\nduring every major bubble people like to come up with new fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company back in the dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of eyes that is the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website\n\nthis internet thing was a new paradigm and so obviously we needed new metrics to determine how valuable these companies were needless to say the vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight\n\ntake your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation i like to pick on tesla personally because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun\n\n\n\n fed manipulation\n\nmost bubbles have been created by federal reserve control of currency and interest rates this market is no different they create a bubble and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new bigger bubble until that pops and so on its like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house\n\nthe catch is interest rates cant drop below zero i mean they can but who wants to be japan for the rest of history\n\nalright ive written enough already and i wont write a whole thesis on fed action and its consequences for now global markets ill just leave this pic here\n\n\n\ntoo long; didn't read  shit is fucked son play the game of chicken as long as you want but at the end of the day

good of course but not the end of the world either whats the worst that can happen if i dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes i lose  of my funds in as little as a month ouch\n\nthe idea that im forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing  a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset\n\nof course the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply wont crash or that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious but the whole point is that the crash is never obvious especially to permabulls they see a dip and they buy it they see a deeper dip what a great opportunity so they buy more and before they realize the dip isnt simply a dip they are already fucked tale as old as time\n\nthe funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational why hold cash when bonds pay more why buy bonds when index funds pay more why buy index funds when spacs pay more why buy spacs when flipping cocaine pays more after all if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since it loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify\n\nwhats most interesting is that this argument isnt even new the ridiculously low interest rates set by

out this rally you will end up behind even if you are right\n\nthis is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls they argue that if you sat out the last  months something this is essentially a straw man argument except in reference to permabears then you would have missed out on massive gains and therefore the implicit argument is you can never sit out\n\nif you carefully analyze this argument you will realize it is literally nothing more than fear of missing out to the extreme its fear of missing out disguised as macroeconomic theory i have to stay in the market perpetually i can never sit out because if i do i will miss out on gains and you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy\n\nfirst of all i will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately permabears people who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains but not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are permabears there are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed\n\nan intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear they adapt to the market and when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid permabear the bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out\n\nxb\n\nlets take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history\n\nxb\n\nmajor indicators of the great bubble\n\nxb\n\n massive retail investment worldwide\n\nwhat are some signs of bubbles historically well a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market do we have that today check on fucking steroids weve got people who cant change a fucking tire on their  civic downloading robinhood and gambling options on margin like what the fuck\n\nthe  iq mongoloid who was washing dishes at papa johns last tuesday do they even have dishes i dont fucking know is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking china or some shit are you kidding me do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching\n\nnot to mention the entire shortsqueeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in bangladesh is downloading robinhood to buy calls on fucking sndl or whatever the fuck\n\npast us market bubbles were largely restricted to the us population it was mostly americans buying american stocks during the dotcom boom but wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into tesla at a  pe ratio whats that noise is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance\n\nthe max pain theory which is ironically popular among permabulls argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors this is of course bullshit but its food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo\n\n\n\n ridiculously speculative investments aka spacs\n\ncciv is worth  billion dollars and it owns literally nothing no deal is in place no announced deal figures have been offered obviously the spac has no earnings or revenue to speak of just  billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium i can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed\n\nwhat is a spac at the end of the day a rich guy steps up and says give me your money and ill decide what ill do with it in a few months\n\nand a million retards step up and say sounds great take my money\n\ntell me this spac shit isnt exactly like the dotcom boom when literally anything with a com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the hot new thing there is no way this spac mania lasts and lots of people will be hurt in the end\n\n\n\n options volume absolutely exploding\n\noptions are becoming the vehicle of choice for investors aka gamblers in the current market stock represents actual ownership of a company the foundation of the actual market but what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term i just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker\n\nthe question i sometimes ask is how much of this market growth is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume you know like derivative cdos leveraging worthless mortgages back in  its something to think about\n\nill just leave this chart here since it makes the case for me this is neither natural nor sustainable\n\n\n\n greater fool logic\n\nill just quote investopedia since im getting lazy here\n\nthe greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date this is because there will always be someone ie a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price\n\nif acting in accordance with the greater fool theory an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality if the theory holds the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another greater fool who could also be hoping to flip them quickly unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices\n\nthe greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions in  when investors purchased faulty mortgagebacked securities it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed\n\nbasically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value this is talking about you\n\n\n\n buffet indicator through the roof\n\nthe buffet indicator has reach its highest ever level for noobies who dont know what this means the buffett indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by us gdp a very high buffett indicator suggests an overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom\n\nthere are two arguments against the buffett indicator as a useful metric the first argument is that gdp is a backward indicator and therefore doesnt account for future growth while this is true it misses the entire point the point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles the point is to tie market valuations to some realworld metric which is necessarily backward looking\n\nthe other argument against the buffett indicator which holds more weight is that us stocks consist of global companies and therefore arent adequately represented by us gdp\n\ni will say these people have a good point but they are also missing several nuances within gdp and market valuations which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post suffice it to say the buffett indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation and cant simply be discarded\n\n\n\n valuations divorced from reality\n\nduring every major bubble people like to come up with new fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company back in the dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of eyes that is the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website\n\nthis internet thing was a new paradigm and so obviously we needed new metrics to determine how valuable these companies were needless to say the vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight\n\ntake your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation i like to pick on tesla personally because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun\n\n\n\n fed manipulation\n\nmost bubbles have been created by federal reserve control of currency and interest rates this market is no different they create a bubble and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new bigger bubble until that pops and so on its like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house\n\nthe catch is interest rates cant drop below zero i mean they can but who wants to be japan for the rest of history\n\nalright ive written enough already and i wont write a whole thesis on fed action and its consequences for now global markets ill just leave this pic here\n\n\n\ntoo long; didn't read  shit is fucked son play the game of chicken as long as you want but at the end of the day

{"prompt": "lately there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever\n\nwhy the stock market is in a bubble  investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dotcom bubble  \n\neven professional investors whom i consider levelheaded and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable\n\nthis will not last  \n\nadding to all of this we can see that the shiller pe ratio is now climbing close to the  dotcom bubble level\n\n\n\nwhile its easy to say that its all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend i feel that we might be missing the other side of the story the s are wildly different times compared to the s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens there is an immense difference in the available capital interest rates and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to  years back \n\nso what i wanted to analyze is should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the new normal given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in finally this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments \n\nthe warning signs\n\nlets first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market spoiler alert  there are a lot of them\n\npe shiller pe cape\n\nthe price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the marketcompany is overvalued when compared to historical trends shiller pe is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal pe\n\nthe current concern is that as of nov the shiller pe for the sp  crossed  which is the highest reading in the last two decades the last time the shiller pe crossed  was during the  dot com bubble the value reached only a max of  before the  financial crisis\n\nthe red flag here is that those who invested when the cape was above  last time  had to wait another  years to break even for a brief period of time just before the  housing market crash and then wait another  more years before the market consistently settled above their buyin price\n\nmoney supply growth aka money printer go brrr\n\nth of all us currency in circulation was printed in  while it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat one can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation\n\n\n\nincreasing use of leverage\n\nthere are two ways of using leverage while investing the first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past  years\n\n for almost  investors shows staggering results  of gen z and  of millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market more than  of the surveyed population borrowed more than k or more for investing while leverage works great in a bull market it can destroy your portfolio during downturns \n\n\n\nthe below research by goldman sachs shows an even more concerning trend retail brokers alone are now trading more options than the entire market used to do in  while this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as robinhood fidelity etrade etc its highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it\n\n\n\nrise of new issues and speculative assets\n\nmore than  billion have been raised by ipos this year this is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the  record in the dust the cherry on top was  where the company is now valued at more than  billion with zero revenue and less than  million in preorder deposits\n\nspacs \n\n\n\nthis is without even getting into the speculative world of crypt where  for more than half a billion dollars a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of  billion and there are now more icos than anyone can keep track of\n\ninvestor expectations\n\nmore than the pe ratio investor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history the pricetosales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the companys sales as we can see on the chart below more than double the companies are trading above x their sales when compared to the  dot com bubble\n\n\n\nif you consider a  stocks that had a very high ps ratio have underperformed those having low ps ratio since most companies dont grow as per expectations\n\n\n\nnow thats a lot of bad news for anyone to digest but\n\nare we certain its a bubble\n\nthere are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally just because we are in an impressive rally it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash lets look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years\n\nlowinterest rates\n\nthis is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the s dotcom bubble between  and  the fed rate varied from    compared to the historically low  that we have now this means that the capital available now is much cheaper to prop up the economy after covid than it ever was this is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns\n\n\n\nnew investors\n\nits no secret that we all hate robinhood but the data they put out during their ipo filing shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investorstraders coming to the market all of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now\n\n\n\nk and index funds\n\nas i have highlighted in s the amount of inflow us index funds receive is massive more than  billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the vanguard  index fund this year and index funds are expected to make up  according to  from fidelity the average k account now has a balance of k and  of workers increased their contribution\n\nthe key point being all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \n\nwhats the implication\n\nas long as the above factors remain as is fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital we might see the party go on much longer than expected\n\nconclusion\n\nthe market of  is significantly different when compared to the s as we can see there are more investors cheaper capital and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before so i feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dotcom bubble is a tad wrong\n\nbut thats not to say that all is well almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future\n\nthe expected annual return by investors above inflation is a whopping  which is  more than what is realistic  this is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly doubledigit return is the norm\n\n\n\neven if we are in a dotcom bubblelike scenario  perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble\n\nbasically even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in  investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to tulip mania as early as  making money using that information was hard there were a few investors such as mark cuban and john templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected\n\nit makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market but pundits have been calling a  right now based on fundamentals the chances do look far higher it does make sense to not make significant onetime investments in the market now but changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best longterm strategy\n\nas peter lynch quoted\n\nfar more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves\n\nuntil next week\n\nfootnotes and existing research\n\n the amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zerocommission trading model was staggering in the s average commission per trade was \n\n as always i am not a financial advisor this is not investment advice please do your own research before investing\n\n leverage only makes sense as long as the equity you are investing into would give better returns than the cost of capital at which you borrowed otherwise your losses are magnified as you have to pay the interest for the borrowed money as well as take your losses on the underlying asset\n\n is a company that has no commercial operations and is formed strictly to

{"prompt": "i made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on gme and several people asked that i turn that comment into a post so here it is\n\nobviously im going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze\n\nfirst the comment as it was\n\nive seen lots of bullish ta on gme keep in mind all ta requires volume to play out how it should we havent had any volume on gme in over a week\n\nholding shares simply isnt enough  needs constant all day every single day buying of shares and in the money options\n\nif you buy options that are  in the money they literally cant price pin because they cant get and keep the price  below current market so you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge and virtually eliminate their means of counterattack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain price at which most contracts expire worthless\n\nif you are intending to help push the squeeze buy shares throughout the day every day if you are playing options mostly buy calls in the money if youre buying otm calls buy as close to current price as you can afford the more imbalanced otm calls are the more theyre just going to price pin at maximum pain they literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new itm call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge\n\nessentially we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with gamestop there are two major reasons \n\n manipulation we cannot do anything about this really aside from buy and hold technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels the shorts while stuck in a stupid position arent stupid they know when the ta is indicating a bullish setup and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup\n\n volume all technical setups require volume to play out if volume doesnt follow the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable except in this case it goes down because its being shorted at every chance\n\nso what do we need to do hold yes but that cant be it if we are doing nothing but holding this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient they can literally hold us in a stalemate for monthsyears if volume never shows up to move the price yes they pay more interest the longer they have to wait theyll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the sec steps in to stop market manipulation \n\nvolume\n\nwithout volume there is no endgame look at every day weve had spikes look at the volume now look at the past week or two we arent making progress because nobody is buying shares aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks believe it or not the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze the whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time if it catches on they can follow it up but if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail\n\nthis thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days if you look at any day there are surges in buy volume but theyre short thats likely a whale testing the market if they see confirmationfollowup from the market its less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure so it will be something like whale buy retail confirmation buys whale buy runaway effect gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze all of those things have to happen consecutively fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack\n\nnow this is going to sound counterintuitive but in order to catalyze the squeeze we have to stop just buying the dip when volume picks up and the price is spiking thats the most important time to buy thats the point when additional buying pressure is most important and until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes we are going to keep bouncing back and forth\n\noptions\n\nthe other side of the coin is options purchases stop devoting the majority of your capital to far otm lotto tickets this helps the short positions because it forces the market makers to help the shorts market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk when you buy an c it does two things\n\n they dont have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral\n\n in incentivizes the market makers to pin the price\n\nyou can do some additional reading on max pain price in options but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless when you buy otm call options youre increasing the maximum pain price which makes it easier for market makers and shorts to pin the price there\n\nif however youre buying a ton of itm call options youre doing two things\n\n deep itm calls have a delta of essentially  this means that in order to remain risk neutral the market makers essentially has to buy  shares immediately upon selling you the contract\n\n it lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most oi this means in order to pin the price at max pain they would need to drop it from its current price\n\nnot only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately meaning they dont care where the price goes you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price\n\nif you must buy otm calls buy ones that are at least closer to being itm the further otm you buy calls the more likely the price will go sideways you can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases once it achieves a runaway squeeze which will be easy to identify you can start buying your lotto tickets\n\ntoo long; didn't read in my opinion if you want to help catalyze the squeeze you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least  in the money", "completion": "buy high never sell got it [Sentiment: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}] [Keywords: ['buy

{"prompt": "a number of years ago i traded fx for a cta i achieved a return of  and my max monthly drawdown was  over about a  year period today im giving away the complete strategy i built and traded to earn this return\n\nbasics\n\n why are you doing this i dont trade this strategy anymore due to a pivot in my trading objectives several years ago i learned the basic concepts from others so im giving back what ive received it doesnt compete with my current style or the approach of the proprietary trading firm i work for this strategy has sat dormant on my computer for the better part of a decade so i figured why not dust it off and pass it on in terms of why now ive noticed an uptick in strategy  questions on reddit and ive started writing answers but stopped because its just too much for a single comment my plan is to reference this post in future interactions with traders\n how do we know this works i could show  and i could give  but at the end of the day all that can be faked my goal is to hand you something which works  provided you are looking for a method and are willing to put in the effort needed to make it work after reading this post there literally is nothing stopping you from adopting this backtesting it and trading it so let the method speak for itself\n\nlets do this thing\n\nstrategy brief\n\nin brief the strategy seeks to participate in an existing trend when momentum picks up in the direction of the trend initial stops are tight and are trailed with pullbacks until momentum ends i traded the strategy on the daily timeframe but it certainly could have been applied to others as well\n\n   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended\n   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended\n   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended\n\nthere are two key concepts here  trend and momentum lets define them and then get into exact entry and exit techniques\n\ntrend\n\nput simply a trend is when price is moving in a certain direction while price swings are in agreement with that general move\n\n uptrend  in an uptrend price swings are making higher highs and higher lowers  \n downtrend  in a downtrend price swings are making lower lows and lower highs  \n\nthe market doesnt always trend and there are ugly trends out there this strategy avoids those times in which the trend is not in force to only focus on environments which favor continuation of an existing trend\n\ntrend momentum\n\nin any trend there is a cycle of with trend momentum followed by against trend momentum this forms the pattern of price pushing to fresh extremes in a trend followed by pullbacks against the trend\n\nwhen the trend reexerts itself you tend to see an explosion of withtrend strength you can identify these points on a chart by big candles in the direction of the overall trend\n\n   a downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of pullback and the continuation of the trend\n   an uptrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and the continuation of the trend\n   a downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and continuation of the trend\n\nand thats really the conceptual backdrop of the strategy we find a trend that is in a pullback and look to enter on fresh momentum in the direction of the trend you can train your eyes to spot these patterns within a couple of hours of study its not rocket science\n\nentry criteria\n\nas per the entry the concepts spell out precisely when to look to enter the market find an uptrend look for a pullback then buy when you get withtrend strength\n\nas per my specific entry criteria i entered with a stop above the market in an uptrend or below the market in a downtrend for example if i identified unfolding momentum in an uptrend i would set an entry order a few pips beyond the high to get me into the trade\n\n   buy stop set above the momentum bar in the direction of the trend\n   sell stop set below the momentum bar in the direction of the trend\n\nexit initial stop\n\nas you can see by   this strategy gets stopped out a lot\n\nthe reason for this is that i am seeking to capture the entire unfolding trend by risking only a small amount to maximize my average win  average loss ratio the goal here is to make the rewardrisk ratio such that when i actually captured a trend it would compensate me several times over for losing trades this is very much a trend following strategy designed to deliver outstanding returns when the market trends and scrape along when it doesnt so the initial stop loss is very tight so as to maximize the reward per unit of risk when the trend cooperates\n\nfor an initial stop loss i set it roughly halfway into the width of the momentum bar if the momentum bar is narrow in relation to the recent trading range then i would set the stop beneath the momentum bar\n\n   stoploss set somewhere near the middle of the candle\n   stoploss set somewhere near the middle of the candle\n\nexit trailing profit\n\nthe stop loss remains in place until the market forms and completes a pullback in the trend when a pullback has been completed and the trend continues the stop loss is moved to the bottom of the pullback in an uptrend or the top of the pullback in a downtrend this process is repeated until the stop is hit and you are taken out of the trade in other words you have very high upside potential on each trade with constrained but much more probable risk\n\n   trailing stops are set beneath pullbacks when a pullback completes by pushing into new highs this process is repeated until you are stopped out\n   this looks complicated but its really not every time the market forms a pullback of  or more bars we wait until price closes beyond the pullback in the direction of the trend and then move our stop to the bottom of the pullback\n\nrisk management\n\nto protect against losses i risked a firm  per trade if my initial stop was hit i would trade at such a size that i would lose  of my account balance no exceptions\n\nthe reason here is that with a trend following strategy under this riskreward framework you are going to lose a lot you need to ensure that you can survive  losses straight with minimal dent to your trading book and you only do this through risk management\n\nindicators for screening\n\nif you notice on my charts which show actual trades i had the  period moving average and the  moving average overlaid on the chart the reason for this is that i used the  period sma as an scanning indicator and the  as a general reference for the trend\n\n  period sma  i used this indicator to screen for momentum bars example if todays close is the first close above the sma and were closing in the top  of the candle then visually inspect the chart to see if were in a trend and this is fresh momentum in the direction of the trend\n  period sma  this indicator gave me a quick ataglance metric to give context to my trend analysis if i viewed price as in a trend i wanted it to be above the  as a loose confirmation that the general trend was indeed upwards\n\nmy primary focus was on price action find a trend trade fresh withtrend momentum when it appears and then ride the trend until it ends the indicators simply served as a helpful scanning tool and you can trade the method without them\n\npractical considerations for real trading\n\npractice and trade review\n\nyou have to internalize this to actually identify it in real time if you want to adopt this strategy you do this through backtesting and verification that your live testing is lining up with your backtest\n\n backtesting  i spent hundreds of hours dragging charts one bar at a time and recording trades that i would have taken if it were realtime on an ongoing basis i would backtest  backtrade the past decade of data for every instrument i traded this practically meant that i was spending  of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and  of my time actually trading if you havent quite figured out trading id suggest you put in serious effort into the area of backtest and intentional practice\n trade review  on an ongoing basis i would do a complete review of all of my trades to figure out how to sharpen my edge and to verify that i was perfectly trading my plan  no matter your strategy i believe trade review is crucial how will you know if youre making mistakes if youre not reviewing what youve done how will you know if you can do better if youre not carefully questioning each and every trade to try and get better this sheet has several more columns and was just one iteration of an ongoing review process\n\nif this seems like a lot of

for a single comment my plan is to reference this post in future interactions with traders\n how do we know this works i could show  and i could give  but at the end of the day all that can be faked my goal is to hand you something which works  provided you are looking for a method and are willing to put in the effort needed to make it work after reading this post there literally is nothing stopping you from adopting this backtesting it and trading it so let the method speak for itself\n\nlets do this thing\n\nstrategy brief\n\nin brief the strategy seeks to participate in an existing trend when momentum picks up in the direction of the trend initial stops are tight and are trailed with pullbacks until momentum ends i traded the strategy on the daily timeframe but it certainly could have been applied to others as well\n\n   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended\n   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended\n   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended\n\nthere are two key concepts here  trend and momentum lets define them and then get into exact entry and exit techniques\n\ntrend\n\nput simply a trend is when price is moving in a certain direction while price swings are in agreement with that general move\n\n uptrend  in an uptrend price swings are making higher highs and higher lowers  \n downtrend  in a downtrend price swings are making lower lows and lower highs  \n\nthe market doesnt always trend and there are ugly trends out there this strategy avoids those times in which the trend is not in force to only focus on environments which favor continuation of an existing trend\n\ntrend momentum\n\nin any trend there is a cycle of with trend momentum followed by against trend momentum this forms the pattern of price pushing to fresh extremes in a trend followed by pullbacks against the trend\n\nwhen the trend reexerts itself you tend to see an explosion of withtrend strength you can identify these points on a chart by big candles in the direction of the overall trend\n\n   a downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of pullback and the continuation of the trend\n   an uptrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and the continuation of the trend\n   a downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and continuation of the trend\n\nand thats really the conceptual backdrop of the strategy we find a trend that is in a pullback and look to enter on fresh momentum in the direction of the trend you can train your eyes to spot these patterns within a couple of hours of study its not rocket science\n\nentry criteria\n\nas per the entry the concepts spell out precisely when to look to enter the market find an uptrend look for a pullback then buy when you get withtrend strength\n\nas per my specific entry criteria i entered with a stop above the market in an uptrend or below the market in a downtrend for example if i identified unfolding momentum in an uptrend i would set an entry order a few pips beyond the high to get me into the trade\n\n   buy stop set above the momentum bar in the direction of the trend\n   sell stop set below the momentum bar in the direction of the trend\n\nexit initial stop\n\nas you can see by   this strategy gets stopped out a lot\n\nthe reason for this is that i am seeking to capture the entire unfolding trend by risking only a small amount to maximize my average win  average loss ratio the goal here is to make the rewardrisk ratio such that when i actually captured a trend it would compensate me several times over for losing trades this is very much a trend following strategy designed to deliver outstanding returns when the market trends and scrape along when it doesnt so the initial stop loss is very tight so as to maximize the reward per unit of risk when the trend cooperates\n\nfor an initial stop loss i set it roughly halfway into the width of the momentum bar if the momentum bar is narrow in relation to the recent trading range then i would set the stop beneath the momentum bar\n\n   stoploss set somewhere near the middle of the candle\n   stoploss set somewhere near the middle of the candle\n\nexit trailing profit\n\nthe stop loss remains in place until the market forms and completes a pullback in the trend when a pullback has been completed and the trend continues the stop loss is moved to the bottom of the pullback in an uptrend or the top of the pullback in a downtrend this process is repeated until the stop is hit and you are taken out of the trade in other words you have very high upside potential on each trade with constrained but much more probable risk\n\n   trailing stops are set beneath pullbacks when a pullback completes by pushing into new highs this process is repeated until you are stopped out\n   this looks complicated but its really not every time the market forms a pullback of  or more bars we wait until price closes beyond the pullback in the direction of the trend and then move our stop to the bottom of the pullback\n\nrisk management\n\nto protect against losses i risked a firm  per trade if my initial stop was hit i would trade at such a size that i would lose  of my account balance no exceptions\n\nthe reason here is that with a trend following strategy under this riskreward framework you are going to lose a lot you need to ensure that you can survive  losses straight with minimal dent to your trading book and you only do this through risk management\n\nindicators for screening\n\nif you notice on my charts which show actual trades i had the  period moving average and the  moving average overlaid on the chart the reason for this is that i used the  period sma as an scanning indicator and the  as a general reference for the trend\n\n  period sma  i used this indicator to screen for momentum bars example if todays close is the first close above the sma and were closing in the top  of the candle then visually inspect the chart to see if were in a trend and this is fresh momentum in the direction of the trend\n  period sma  this indicator gave me a quick ataglance metric to give context to my trend analysis if i viewed price as in a trend i wanted it to be above the  as a loose confirmation that the general trend was indeed upwards\n\nmy primary focus was on price action find a trend trade fresh withtrend momentum when it appears and then ride the trend until it ends the indicators simply served as a helpful scanning tool and you can trade the method without them\n\npractical considerations for real trading\n\npractice and trade review\n\nyou have to internalize this to actually identify it in real time if you want to adopt this strategy you do this through backtesting and verification that your live testing is lining up with your backtest\n\n backtesting  i spent hundreds of hours dragging charts one bar

{"prompt": "absolutely the answer is yes but we cant apply a simple and fixed model to all stock markets each stock market is an independent viberation with its own cycle and development laws therefore the cycle and law of the stock market will be introduced before presenting the text of this book\n\nsince the s economists in western countries have engaged in the study the law of the cycle and all believed that there was a longterm law in the economic growth or recession there is noting new thing under the sun\n\nin  the american economist s kuznets proposed a business cycle applying to housing construction with an average length of  years this longterm cycle is known as the kuznets cycle or building cycle c juglar a french economist published his business crisis and cycle in france britain and the united states in  in this book he pointed out that the capitalist economy fluctuated every nine to ten years as generally called juglar cycle joseph schumpeter took this as the mediumterm cycle or the juglar cycle\n\nedward r deway known as the father of cycle analysis believed that the most statistically reliable cycles were  years and  years he was also the founder of many institutions studying the cycles edward r dewey  dedicated his life to study the cycles not limited to the business cycle and in  he was appointed as the chief economic analyst by the us department of commerce trying to find the cause of the great depression in  and  in the united states edward r dewey established the foundation for the study of cycles in pittsburgh in  the following are some graphs about the cycles proposed by edward\n\nbusiness cycles can be categorized into longterm mediumterm and shortterm ones you may ask is there any business cycle in the stock market or the economy lets begin with the stock market cycle and then we will talk about the real estate cycle\n\nthe year cycle is one of the cores of ganns cycle theory when making a prediction the year cycle can be divided in further including the following different cycles\n\n year cycle\n\n year cycle   x\n\n year cycle  x\n\n year cycle  x\n\n year cycle  x\n\nxb\n\n\n\nif this year cycle is applied to calculate the stock market cycle you will get an amazing discovery  for example hong kongs stock market crash in  followed with another one  years later namely in  because of the upsurge of red chip speculation by foreign investors in  and the united states increase of the interest rates for  successive times  years later around the year of  and  the stock market underwent a huge decline because of the outbreak of avian influenza in  namely  years after that hsi hit the bottom as a consequence of the financial tsunami when it came to  exactly  years later hsi witnessed a depreciation in  after experiencing the bull market\n\nwhen the year cycle is applied to shanghai securities composite index there will also come something incredible as shown in the chart below the first peak after the establishment of shanghai stock exchange occurred in may  following ganns year cycle another peak appeared in the half of  exactly  years later  years later the year of  witnessed the climax of the bull market after  years the year of  marked the starting point of the bull market in  it is thought that the year of   years later will be another high or low point\n\njust as the old chinese sayings go that both people and things undergo great changes in a decade gold may become worthless in a decade and we cannot predict what will happen in a decade and dont laugh at poor people wearing rags these sayings point out the essence of the year cycle juglar proposed that there was a  to  years cyclical fluctuation for the market economy in his book business crisis and cycle in france

{"prompt": "we have all heard it  time in the market beats timing the market\n\nat the same time we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market the market always seems to break some new alltime high records so we wait for the inevitable crashpullback to invest its high time we put both strategies to test basically what i wanted to analyze was\n\nwhether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested\n\nanalysis\n\nfor this lets take someone who started investing approximately  decades back  to be exact i created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you\n\na\u00a0invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year\n\nb\u00a0was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year\n\nc\u00a0did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year\n\nd\u00a0just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest  \u00a0\n\nfor analysis simplicity lets assume that you were on a conservative side never picked individual stocks and always made your investments to sp  for investment amount consider that you started with investing k in  and increased your investments by  for every subsequent year so you made a total investment of k over the last  years \u00a0\n\nresults\n\n\n\nthe analysis did throw up some interesting results theres a lot to unpack here and lets break it down by each segment\n\nthe most important insight is that its virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market  even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year you will still end up having a  return on your invested amount\n\nat the opposite end of the spectrum if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year you would have made a cool  more than someone who invested only at the top given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases lets consider some more realistic scenarios \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nif you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each monthyear you would still make a shade over  on your investments\n\nout of all the above scenarios you would have made the most amount of money a whopping  return if you invested only during major crashes in this type of investing you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash\n\nwhile this seems like a good idea in theory its extremely difficult to execute properly in real life the main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are\n\na the current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes its very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening you can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up it can end up wiping out your portfolio\n\nb\u00a0identifying a crash itself is very hard\n\n\n\nas we can see from the above chart the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year so even when the market is down  it becomes extremely difficult to know whether its going into a deeper crash or whether its going to bounce back up\n\nconclusion\n\nwhile the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returnswise practically its very difficult to execute it\n\nfor eg even if you predicted the  coronavirus crash correctly where would be your entry point the market was down  by mar th another  by mar th and then another  by march th for a total of  if you did not get in at the absolute bottom you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous runup \u00a0\u00a0\n\nit is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns adding to this in the last  years  of the best days in the market happened within  days of the worst ones  if you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested\n\nif you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom you will make an absolute killing in the market for the rest of us continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice\n\ndata used in the analysis \n\nfootnotes\n\n for the analysis dotcom crash  sep   market downturn  housing market crash   stock market fall  stock

{"prompt": "i know you guys are probably sick of hearing gme related stuff but i really wanted to post this here to get some additional thoughtsfeedback from experienced investors\n\nlong post ahead but i encourage you to read the whole thing\n\ntoo long; didn't read data points strongly point to hedge funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they havent truly covered full version below\n\ntheres an insightful piece on  that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly\n\nfirst way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to coverbuy back shares at progressively lower levels\n\n\n\nquoting from tradesmithdaily\n\nplummeting short interest along with a plummeting gme share price in other words could indicate that the reddit army is headed for the hills and the longs were selling early giving the shorts a means to cover as the longs got out important to note that if the long holders of gme shares did not break ranks and sell en masse it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time because without a critical mass of longside holders selling into the market the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered bought back their short positions\n\n\n\nhowever the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in gme didnt really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did demoralizing the retail side and further breaking the squeeze\n\n\n\nto now quote verbatim from tradesmithdaily\n\nthe way the hedge funds could have done this  made it appear as if they covered their shorts even when they really didnt  involves trickery in the options market\n\nthe tactics involved are not a secret in fact the securities and exchange commission sec knows all about such tactics and published a risk alert memo on the topic in august \n\nthe sec memo is titled strengthening practices for preventing and detecting illegal options trading used to reset reg sho closeout obligations you can\u00a0\n\nthe memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language but heres a quick rundown\n\n if short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades\n a hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock  meaning they are now short the call options having sold the call options to someone else typically a market maker  and simultaneously buy shares against the call options\n the shares bought against the call options could be synthetic longs  meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock  as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade\n this works because if a market maker buys options from an options writer the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of naked shorting as part of their hedging function this is necessary under the current rules and the current system for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades\n as a result of the above transaction the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls a synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasnt part of the original float the synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts legally initiated by the market maker so the market maker can hedge\n the hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have bought back their short position via buying long shares  except they actually havent the synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market makers hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund\n\nit gets very complicated very fast\n\nbut the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like theyve covered their shorts  even if they havent truly covered and cant for lack of available float  by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays market maker naked shorting exceptions and legal practices of synthetic share creation new longs and shorts made from thin air relating to marketmaking\n\nbelow is a section of the sec memo from page  that gets to the heart of it\n\ntrader a may enter a buywrite transaction consisting of selling deepinthemoney calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale by doing so trader a appears to have purchased shares to meet the brokerdealers closeout obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion in practice however the circumstances suggest that trader a has no intention of delivering shares and is instead reestablishing or extending a fail position\n\n\n\nin short no pun intended these tricks\u00a0help hedge funds maintain short positions that legally speaking they werent supposed to have because the shares were never properly located which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of ftidsfailed to deliver shares  and michael burrys now deleted tweet viewable here  about how when he called back shares he lent out brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located\n\nthese factors lend credence to the idea that shorts werent really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options in order to cover short positions that they shouldnt have had to begin with because shares were never properly located\n\nseparately but potentially related s released updated short numbers last sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from  to  a day later on friday to  on sunday while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated  which many found to be suspicious later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded  short interest percentage but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice\n\nfor a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached \n\n\n\nexcerpt\n\nthe real short  according to ss data is  however their  figure is technically not a lie but extremely misleading i will explain everything\n\nhere is what they didsources s head\n\ns head is redefining share float to include shares that dont exist in order to be able to say shorted  of float is lower\n\nit reduces the traditional si  float instead of shares shortedfloat our calc is shares shorted float  shares shorted\n\nso by this definition if a stock is shorted  of existing shares total banana count borrowed and resold x and total shares is  short  is calculated like this shorts   shares   longs whose shares are borrowed  that is the normal way we define short  would say its  shorted ss way says \n\nknowing this formula we can work back to what s would have said the short  of float was using the normal definition of short  of float short of float means for all existing shares  shorts or ont he other side of the trade longs whose shares were borrowed away to short is  as much as existing shares meaning portion of shares short by the normal definition  of existing bananas borrowed is   \n\nthat is ss data is telling them that after friday trading gme is still  short\n\n\n\nmany have pointed out this could be manipulation on ss part its interesting to note that as late as the jan th ihor from s stated most gme shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadnt moved much at all  initially on the th he claimed short interest float to be   the next day he claimed short interest to be   of float  days later on sunday s released a report on the calculated short interest to be  oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted but found this  which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time it turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of  which the

it but bear with me while i lay out the nittygritty i like the strategy so much that ive decided to finally lay it out in full detail for others to learn\n\nmy inspiration for this started after

sell spx spreads that expire wednesday wednesday i sell spreads that expire friday friday i sell spreads that expire monday i hold these all the way to expiration and then open a new position with the next expiration  of the time these expire worthless and i collect full premium the other  of the time i suffer a small or large loss over the long run the expected return blows the market out of the waterwhich leads me to\n\nexpected return\n\nive been running this since may  and am averaging something around  apy based on max risk for the spread its absurd dont believe me my full trade log is published  and i update it in realtime yes thats my website no im not selling any kind of productservice there more on that later\n\nrisk  drawdown\n\nthis massive positive return doesnt come without a cost of course and if something sounds too good to be true it usually is and the cost here is that yeah while annual return is a ridiculous  max drawdown can be  or more whaaaaat yeah thats right while these spreads expire worthless  of the time the other  can result in huge losses these losses can accumulate up to  or more depending on the environment\n\nso this is a guaranteed way to blow up your account right well it is if you allocate too much capital to it but if you keep your allocation small which i do then a  drawdown for this one strategy will be a small fraction of your overall portfolio i personally only allocate about  of my total portfolio to this what that means is that ifwhen this trading plan suffers a  loss that only represents  drawdown for my portfolio and i can tap into my other investments to replenish this trading plan\n\nthese massive losses do happen but they dont last long i ran this very strategy through covid when vix moved from  to  in a month and my max drawdown was only about  i reloaded from my other investments and this put selling strategy recovered and turned green in  before the market itself didafter i went down \n\npennies meet steamroller right\n\nyeah this is pretty close to the definition of picking up pennies in front of a steamroller theres nothing inherently wrong with that if\n\n the pennies that you collect add up to more than what the steamroller takes away\n you limit allocation so that when the steamroller hits you it doesnt destroy you\n\n  i collect around  premium per position compared to max risk spread width  of the time they expire worthless so i keep the full  the other  of the time i suffer what is usually a large loss averaging around  do the math here    is  gain on the wins    is  loss on the losers    makes for a very positive expected returnso that takes care of  the pennies i collect far outweigh the steamroller when it hits me\n\n  i only allocate  of my overall portfolio to this when the steamroller hits me and results in a  loss for the strategy im not wiped out thats only  drawdown on my account which is easy to recover from this is what so many people miss when talking about the ole steamroller if you just keep allocation in check its okay to get hit by a steamroller every now and then\n\ntrade process  timing  strike selection\n\nthe process here is simple every mwf afternoon open a new set of put spreads expiring at the next expiration mondays position expires wednesday wednesdays position expires friday fridays position expires monday my short strike is around  delta my long strike is  points below that this results in a short strike around  otm in low iv environments and  otm in high iv environments the long strike will be  otm again depending on iv itll be farther out as vix rises\n\nyou only suffer max loss if the sp drops  in a day or two out of absolutely nowhere vix   or if sp drops  in a day or two after freefall has already started in  months and with vix rocketing to  during that timeframe not once has one of my spreads even seen max lossim sure itll happen at some point but if didnt happen in  im curious to see when it would happen\n\nwhy spx\n\n  expirations available every week mondaywednesdayfriday\n highly liquid\n cashsettled no underlying given to me on assignment\n low trading fees for me personally  your mileage may vary\n beneficial tax treatment  longterm based on irs  contract straddles\n less paperwork to file for taxes futures and index options aggregate together on irs tax forms eliminating  line items from this trading strategy in a year\n\nspx is awesome\n\nalternatives to spx\n\nsome of you may not have access to spx options or your account isnt large enough to be handle spx options they are huge a single contract represents k notional the cashsettlement and riskdefined trades help diminish the impact of size but its still a lot of underlying to carry around es futures are half the size and should work as well just be sure you understand fees assignment and liquidity first spy can also work and is even smaller than es again understand assignment of shares and fees you also lose the tax benefit with spy but on smaller accounts this may be the only viable option\n\nmore reading  full trade log and performance history\n\ni set up a website dedicated to just this one strategy its not an interactive website or anything im not selling anything or pushing a servicenewsletter its just a place where i can define the strategy in way more detail than ive done here and also a place where i can maintain a current and updated log of all of my trades and performance history to learn more about the strategy and see actual tradesperformance check out the website\n\n\n\ni am not selling or advertising anything on that site whether my own stuff or somebody elses yes theres a donate page up there but thats not why i created the site and not why i posted this but if you find this love it and want to return the favor theres at least that option\n\nquestions  suggestions\n\nif youre interested in this but have questionsconcerns fire away i like to teach people and im here to help\n\nor if youre a pro or tried something like this before and see or know something that im missing let me know that as well try to blast holes in my trading plan i feel good enough about it now to finally share with the massesbut if there are any glaring holes or flaws i want to know what those are\n\nhope you enjoyed reading", "completion": "deleted [Sentiment: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound':

{"prompt": "i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them\n\nfirst and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options\n\nthere are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised\n\n \n\nnow the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information\n\nas for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price\n\n \n\ni know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario\n\nwhether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay\n\ntime decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay\n\ntime decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches\n\ntheta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support\n\n \n\nalthough time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling\n\nthe reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post\n\nregardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time\n\nmaybe after this youll see why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns\n\nhope this was helpful let me know what ya think", "completion": "i understand all this the thing i dont understand is how to not lose all my money [Sentiment: {'neg': 0.0,

similarly rally would demolish a shortonly portfolio combining long and short positions made my portfolio more or less neutral to the broader market even if there were no overvalued stocks i made sure to short something  this insulated me from market crashes and allowed me to leverage my long positions in undervalued stocks safely\n\nin options trading hedging is even more important many options traders who are wheeling selling cashsecured puts and covered calls have a lot of long equity short volatility positions and should be hedging their portfolios maybe shorting an index to balance out the long equity exposure of all these puts may be a good idea delta hedging is also an option buying options elsewhere to hedge the short volatility exposure from these wheel positions can also protect your portfolio from drawdowns\n\n size your trades based on your edge\n\n the etf arbitrage case\n\nin the etf arbitrage simulation we were aps who could create and redeem shares of an etf when the price of the etf was higher than that of the stocks in the etf we could buy the stocks and create shares of the expensive etf to sell similarly when the etf became cheaper than the stocks we could buy the cheap etf and break it down into expensive stocks and sell them the main risk was execution risk the chance that our algo was broken or it was too slow executing trades after the arbitrage was already gone\n\nthis trading simulation was reasonably straightforward but taught me one important lesson when there is an arbitrage an edge with nearly no risk we must trade as much as possible before its gone in most simulations i learned to maintain reasonable position sizes however etf arbitrage was nearly riskfree provided i wrote the algo correctly if i didnt trade aggressively my classmates would be and the arbitrage opportunity would disappear\n\nin the options markets we should take many trades in small sizes systematic trading strategies such as selling weekly or monthly spy options tend to be profitable over time but only if the trader is careful with their position sizing\n\n work harder than anyone else\n\nthis should be obvious but for some reason it isnt many compete to make money in the markets my class was no different the pnl across the various trading simulations determined what your grades were going to be while we had some trading simulations that we could trade by hand we could choose to write algorithms to trade for us instead having studied each case beforehand i spent hours outside of class writing python scripts to trade on my behalf this allowed me to execute trades faster and more accurately than my classmates ever could by hand\n\n the liability trading case\n\nin a liability trading simulation we were brokers handling large orders for other institutional clients our edge was that as brokers we would receive bids for a large amount of stock at a slight premium or be offered large blocks of shares at a discount however because these trades were so large we couldnt just close our positions immediately we had to split up our trades into several orders so they wouldnt push the market around too much our risk was the possibility of the stock moving against us while we tried to sell our shares or cover our short positions over time\n\nmany of my classmates traded this simulation by hand they would receive an order use an excel spreadsheet to evaluate each trade and offload their positions manually those who traded by hand needed up to a minute to process trades as a result they were exposed to the market for too long and many trades moved against them on the other hand i processed orders in four to five seconds because i was using an algo to trade\n\n an edge exists for a reason its always about providing value\n\nnot a single trading simulation involved technical analysis in every trading simulation we had a role and a service to provide we had a reason our trading strategies were profitable we provided value in the market\n\nliability traders help execute large trades for clients lacking the infrastructure or patience market makers provide the best bid and offer giving traders better prices when they want to enter and exit positions portfolio managers can help resolve supply and demand imbalances in the market buying oversupplied oversold securities they can also short highly demanded overvalued stocks finally aps help keep etf prices in line with stock prices through arbitrage\n\nretail traders should be no different the easiest services we can provide to the market involve risk premiums and price inefficiencies\n\nrisk premiums involve holding risk that the market tends to compensate traders for risk premiums include long equity  fixedincome positions supplying equity and debt capital and short options positions supplying options remember that not all risk is created equal day trading is risky but arguably provides no value to the market\n\ntrading price inefficiencies generally involve providing liquidity to market participants who might be forced to trade at bad prices we can get paid by taking the other side of forced trades which helps our counterparty get a better price more on this in the next point \n\n not everyone is doing things for the same reason trade with people who are forced to\n\nin real markets many people are forced to trade at bad prices many institutional funds have rules that require them to buy options as a hedge no matter the price some hedge funds sell their lowerquality holdings before their annual reports so they dont have to explain to investors why theyre bagholding the latest meme stock they then repurchase these stocks after their report if enough hedge funds sell the same stocks at the same time these stocks temporarily become too cheap\n\n the market making case\n\nthe marketmaking simulation was one of the hardest we provided quotes on three stocks and our job was to earn money collecting the bidask spread the hard part was keeping the spread since we were often on the wrong side of trades a wave of buying would leave us short stock while the market rallied and a wave of selling would leave us holding the bag while we collected the spread with every trade keeping our positions neutral was extremely difficult\n\nim not going to lie my marketmaking algorithm was terrible i would get flooded with orders on one side and be forced to dump my inventory at even worse prices however i noticed that everyone was panic buying or dumping stock at the same times i was so in my next iteration i decided to change my strategy rather than competing with other mms for orders i would wait for a wave of buy orders and join them these orders alongside my own caused my classmates algorithms to shift their prices higher and higher as they desperately attempted to cover their short positions i would then helpfully sell them my stock at inflated prices sometimes i would see a wave of sell orders and short the stock knowing i could buy back it at a discount as the other market makers tried to dump their inventory\n\ndid i end up successfully building a marketmaking program unfortunately no but i made a lot of money\n\nand that class was the sweetest a ive ever earned", "completion": "good writeup original poster wish i had a class nearly as interesting my trading courses in uni were mostly

{"prompt": "like chan found a bloomberg terminal\n\nthis is how wallstreetbets define their community for those who dont know  is one of the biggest stock market communities in the world having more than mm members its where millions are made and lost every day on outrageous bets and the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins\n\nwhether its for the insane yolos posted every day or breaking robinghood with infinite leverage plays or the legendary shortsqueeze involving gme wallstreetbets is where the action goes down  sums up the absolute chaos that rwallstreetbets is\n\nbut what we are interested in is to see if we can beat the market by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets after all\n\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\nreddits praw api and pushshift api were used to obtain the data for this analysis there were more than  million comments and posts made on wsb in  i have had a vm running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since dec\n\nthe summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data you can get it from \n\n\n\nanalysis\n\nahh this is where it gets tricky there are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from wsb since there are millions of comments its not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit\n\nso what i have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day  why i settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when heshe would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions the more the chances of investing in the said stock\n\nconsidering the practical limitations i kept the cutoff at the top  stocks once we have found the top  discussed stocks of that day we invest in them at the market close then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next\n\na one week\n\nb one month\n\nc till date  from the date of investment to today\n\nthe benchmark for comparison is spy we will compare the returns against spy to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by spy during the same time period \n\n\n\nresults\n\nbefore we jump into the returns here is a visualization of how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in wsb\n\n\n\n in case the visualization is not loading  \n\n\n\nwe would have made a grand total of  investments  in  following this strategy we would have lost money on more than  over the next week and more than  over the next month but if you consider till date we are slightly above  if you compare this to spy its an extremely poor performance as during the same period spy would have given a positive return of  over one week  over one month and  till date as spy is trading at an alltime high now\n\nbut the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately  out of the  stocks you pick even if you get  wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high which is what wsb is aiming for  its definitely not for safe plays\n\nso how has the average performance of wsb picks fared\n\n\n\nwould you look at that wsb recommendations have hands down beaten spy across all time periods it gave a  overperformance over the period of one week and  over one month and a whopping  if you had held on to your stocks\n\nbut keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top  list\n\n\n\ngme has been in the top discussed stocks in  of the days and on average you would have gained  if you invested in it every day both amc and tsla are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly only bb clov and wish on average have lost money \n\nnow that our main question is out of the way we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns\n\n\n\nunsurprisingly gamestop and amc are at the top of the pile with gme returning an insane  in one week even if you remove gme and amc due to the unlikely scenario of a shortsqueeze the other  stocks would have doubled your investment in one week \n\n\n\nfor every winner there are bound to be losers if you bought into gme at the top of the rally you would have lost  of your investment in the next week all the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag\n\nbut what if you did not want to invest in  stocks every day what if you only wanted to invest in the top stock of the day ie the one creating the most discussion would you have beaten the market\n\n\n\nunsurprisingly you would have beaten the market by a wide margin this is mainly due to the insane returns generated by gme amc tsla etc which came to the top of the list you are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks  \n\n\n\nlimitations\n\nthere are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of\n\n as explained in footnote there are  days of missing data  though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as its lesser than  of the total days in the analysis\n this analysis does not consider options which is a big part of what wsb is made of the returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks\n we have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies the results might be different if we expand our time horizon\n finally the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock i would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company my hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments a part of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works  stay tuned \n\n\n\nconclusion\n\nbefore starting the analysis i fully expected to end it with\n\nthe real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way\n\ni was expecting that the chatter in wsb would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag\n\nbut i was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat spy in returns that too across different time periods\n\neither its due to the selffulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more or it might just be that wsb is the place where we can successfully leverage the \n\nwhatever the case may be you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies  in one week only to drop  in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year for that you are rewarded with marketbeating returns\n\nif you liked reading this one you will love\n\n how to  from the crypto market\n  while investing\n\nuntil next week\n\n\n\nfootnotes\n\n during the gme rally in january the traffic was so high that the vm failed i have used pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible but keep in mind that there are  days of missing data from th jan to th feb and  days of missing data in april nd week\n\n to find the most popular tickers i used a base of around  stock tickers that i got from iex cloud the program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post this is by far the most dataintensive exercise i have done if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join we processed more than  billion rows to find the most popular tickers\n\n if spy was in the top  tickers we would invest in that as well i feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile\n\n its lesser than the expected  investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss footnote  and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers eg aphira due to which we could not get the financial data from yahoo finance\n\n\n\n\n\n just as easily\n\ndisclaimer i am not a financial advisor", "completion":

the future of the business goes from stable to uncertain the value of your options will change drastically the reason it will change drastically is because theres lots of vega or exposure to a change implied volatility\n\nthere is money to be made where the level of implied volatility is different than what we think it should be\n\n is there money to be made trading the longer dated options\n\na lot of people think you cant make a lot of money trading longer dated options so people will maybe buy leaps and sell covered calls against them since the leap is not very sensitive to volatility but as i hope you are starting to see this can not be further from the truth\n\nfor example lets take a look at a trade that was shared with me on arkx\n\nwhen it became optionable this year a friend of mine shared some research on the longer dated options that was really interesting the  year options were trading at  implied volatility and our conclusion was that they were worth  implied volatility  over the next couple months it came all the way down a  point drop in implied volatility\n\nxb\n\n\n\nso the question is how profitable was the trade\n\nhere is what the position looked like at inception take a look at our greeks as you can see\n\nxb\n\n\n\nheres what it looked like at the end\n\nxb\n\n\n\n the options basically got cut in half\n\nbecause of the nature of this trade and the confidence in the research myself and the others i know in this position were able to scale up pretty big \n\nxb\n\n\n\n what was really interesting is how wrong the markets pricing was\n\nas we go further out in time there tends to be less liquidity on some of these names when you go further out theres just less eyes on it that means opportunity\n\nfor example on rivn myself and the others i was looking at this trade with basically made up all of the longer dated volume early on tuesday \n\nbecause of how poorly it was being priced and the thoroughness of the research we did i was able to scale up on this position significantly ive found that theres actually a lot of opportunity like arkx that comes around so now lets discuss a couple of basic ways to price these out and find these opportunities\n\n idea generation\n\nsomething that ive noticed is when realized volatility spikes in the near term sometimes the whole term structure will elevate and the back can get really out of line\n\nso i typically look for these types of trades when bad news has come out around a stock industry or sector\n\nexamples of times that i have traded this way\n\n when archegos blew up longer dated vols on the companies that were held by the fund stayed elevated post event\n arkx release options were pretty illiquid and very poorly priced anticipating a lot more volatility than it should have given the underlying stocks\n tsla longer dated options were being priced at extremely high levels given the size of the company and relative to correlated assets\n kweb pricing in extremely high volatility higher than covid because of chinese market issues\n rivn starting to release options and pricing them at insane levels of implied volatility\n\n how to price the level of implied volatility disca example\n\nin order to explain how to go about pricing the level of implied volatility i am going to go through a trade that i took earlier this year on disca\n\nkeep in mind that this is the sentence we are trying to complete the market is showing me that the stock is trading at an implied volatility of x i think the level of implied vol should be y\n\n the situation\n\nearlier this year when the archegos fund blew up the stocks that it was holding took a massive hit simply put they got crushed this lead to a massive opportunity that was missed by much of the retail community the options market went berserk \n\nbefore the fund blew up the fair value for options were around  iv \n\nbut when everything exploded the crazy movement in the short term caused the whole option chain to lift up all of a sudden the  day and  day options were trading at  iv\n\nfor perspective iv was at  during covid for the same dte\n\nbasically things look really crazy so i set out to price the options and try to uncover a trade\n\n there are two ways to price the options here absolute value and relative value lets go over each way for disca\n\n  example of absolute value pricing\n\nabsolute value pricing involves comparing what we are seeing today for a stock against what we have seen in the past \n\ndisca july options were trading at  iv before the archegos liquidation as the event happened implied volatility shot up to  a couple days later when the event was over it was still at  iv \n\nxb\n\n\n\nthinking about how options are priced it would make sense that the level of implied volatility came down here since the impact from the event had happened already assuming there were no further chain reactions and therefore the level of implied vol should come back down to what it was preevent or \n\nthe reason i didt think there would be chain reactions is that the realized volatility basically stopped after the event check this out\n\nxb\n\n\n\n with a normal implied volatility of  the event over and rv returning to normal it seemed reasonable to expect the iv to come back down to the  range\n\n  example of relative value pricing\n\nrelative value pricing is an extremely powerful way to price options it involves comparing the options for a stock we are interested in against other stocks that are correlated \n\nfor example ko and pep are strongly correlated they have similar levels of implied volatility take a look at this pic\n\nxb\n\n\n\nthe above picture is showing  blue  pep  day iv green  ko  day iv bottom green  ratio between ko and pep  day iv\n\nas you can see they move together when ko vol goes up so does pep\n\nlooking at the ratio you can see they have an average ratio between them that they mean revert around this is because they have correlated movements and implied volatilities when the spread between them gets too large we see it close \n\nnow imagine we saw this\n\nxb\n\n\n\nthe red line is a hypothetical situation where the ratio between them shot up\n\nin this situation we could also say that there is an opportunity to trade the level of implied volatility for these companies\n\nwe could buy vol on the lower iv one sell vol on the higher one or we could look for which leg is inefficient and likely to change the most and just trade that one\n\n so how did i use relative value pricing to trade disca \n\nfirst i went out to find a correlated stock the one i settled on was foxa then i plotted the ivs for each of them and looked at the ratio \n\nxb\n\n\n\nas you can see at the time of the disaster the iv went through the roof since foxa was not a part of the disaster it was clear that it wasnt really an industry impacting event and that when the disaster is over the volatility should return to something back in line with this correlation \n\n with an average ratio of about  and foxa trading at around  iv it seemed reasonable that we should see disca volatility come back to around    iv\n\nmy analysis on disca painted a very clear picture of what should happen to the options after the event because i had done enough leg work to develop a good thesis i was able to pack on some size and make a fantastic return \n\n both my absolute value and relative value narrowed down on a similar fair value for implied volatility on disca between  and \n\nfrom here i went and sold july straddles on disca and sure enough the iv came down to my expected fair value and i was able to pay for a nice vacation  \n\ni closed out this position when it was pretty much at my fair value \n\non the flip side if this trade had gone against me i would have to go back to the drawing board and really dig into my thesis holding these types of positions through iv spikes can be catastrophic if you are wrong so a lot of work would have to go into why its moving against me \n\non a couple other positions it has moved against me in the short term but then i have been right in the end of the day weathering those storms is no joke though especially if you have a meaningful amount of money on the line this is why i always stress the importance of knowing your stuff before scaling up your trades\n\n conclusion\n\nby knowing how to price the level of implied volatility you can develop really strong ideas that can yield great returns this has been one of my primary strategies this year especially with the meme stock craze tensions in china etc \n\n important point\n\nthis is not about just selling high iv a lot of the times iv is high for a reason this is about pricing iv and selling when it is expensive\n\na lot of traders make the mistake of selling because its high but i hope this post helps you think different about volatility and gives you some ideas about where you can find a real edge in the market \n\nremember once you have an idea of where iv should be you can make a trade if its different than what the market is pricing\n\n if you have ay questions leave a comment and ill try my best to help \n\nhappy trading\n\n ag", "completion": "best series on this website [Sentiment: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.488, 'pos': 0.512, 'compound': 0.6369}] [Keywords:

scale up on this position significantly ive found that theres actually a lot of opportunity like arkx that comes around so now lets discuss a couple of basic ways to price these out and find these opportunities\n\n idea generation\n\nsomething that ive noticed is when realized volatility spikes in the near term sometimes the whole term structure will elevate and the back can get really out of line\n\nso i typically look for these types of trades when bad news has come out around a stock industry or sector\n\nexamples of times that i have traded this way\n\n when archegos blew up longer dated vols on the companies that were held by the fund stayed elevated post event\n arkx release options were pretty illiquid and very poorly priced anticipating a lot more volatility than it should have given the underlying stocks\n tsla longer dated options were being priced at extremely high levels given the size of the company and relative to correlated assets\n kweb pricing in extremely high volatility higher than covid because of chinese market issues\n rivn starting to release options and pricing them at insane levels of implied volatility\n\n how to price the level of implied volatility disca example\n\nin order to explain how to go about pricing the level of implied volatility i am going to go through a trade that i took earlier this year on disca\n\nkeep in mind that this is the sentence we are trying to complete the market is showing me that the stock is trading at an implied volatility of x i think the level of implied vol should be y\n\n the situation\n\nearlier this year when the archegos fund blew up the stocks that it was holding took a massive hit simply put they got crushed this lead to a massive opportunity that was missed by much of the retail community the options market went berserk \n\nbefore the fund blew up the fair value for options were around  iv \n\nbut when everything exploded the crazy movement in the short term caused the whole option chain to lift up all of a sudden the  day and  day options were trading at  iv\n\nfor perspective iv was at  during covid for the same dte\n\nbasically things look really crazy so i set out to price the options and try to uncover a trade\n\n there are two ways to price the options here absolute value and relative value lets go over each way for disca\n\n  example of absolute value pricing\n\nabsolute value pricing involves comparing what we are seeing today for a stock against what we have seen in the past \n\ndisca july options were trading at  iv before the archegos liquidation as the event happened implied volatility shot up to  a couple days later when the event was over it was still at  iv \n\nxb\n\n\n\nthinking about how options are priced it would make sense that the level of implied volatility came down here since the impact from the event had happened already assuming there were no further chain reactions and therefore the level of implied vol should come back down to what it was preevent or \n\nthe reason i didt think there would be chain reactions is that the realized volatility basically stopped after the event check this out\n\nxb\n\n\n\n with a normal implied volatility of  the event over and rv returning to normal it seemed reasonable to expect the iv to come back down to the  range\n\n  example of relative value pricing\n\nrelative value pricing is an extremely powerful way to price options it involves comparing the options for a stock we are interested in against other stocks that are correlated \n\nfor example ko and pep are strongly correlated they have similar levels of implied volatility take a look at this pic\n\nxb\n\n\n\nthe above picture is showing  blue  pep  day iv green  ko  day iv bottom green  ratio between ko and pep  day iv\n\nas you can see they move together when ko vol goes up so does pep\n\nlooking at the ratio you can see they have an average ratio between them that they mean revert around this is because they have correlated movements and implied volatilities when the spread between them gets too large we see it close \n\nnow imagine we saw this\n\nxb\n\n\n\nthe red line is a hypothetical situation where the ratio between them shot up\n\nin this situation we could also say that there is an opportunity to trade the level of implied volatility for these companies\n\nwe could buy vol on the lower iv one sell vol on the higher one or we could look for which leg is inefficient and likely to change the most and just trade that one\n\n so how did i use relative value pricing to trade disca \n\nfirst i went out to find a correlated stock the one i settled on was foxa then i plotted the ivs for each of them and looked at the ratio \n\nxb\n\n\n\nas you can see at the time of the disaster the iv went through the roof since foxa was not a part of the disaster it was clear that it wasnt really an industry impacting event and that when the disaster is over the volatility should return to something back in line with this correlation \n\n with an average ratio of about  and foxa trading at around  iv it seemed reasonable that we should see disca volatility come back to around    iv\n\nmy analysis on disca painted a very clear picture of what should happen to the options after the event because i had done enough leg work to develop a good thesis i was able to pack on some size and make a fantastic return \n\n both my absolute value and relative value narrowed down on a similar fair value for implied volatility on disca between  and \n\nfrom here i went and sold july straddles on disca and sure enough the iv came down to my expected fair value and i was able to pay for a nice vacation  \n\ni closed out this position when it was pretty much at my fair value \n\non the flip side if this trade had gone against me i would have to go back to the drawing board and really dig into my thesis holding these types of positions through iv spikes can be catastrophic if you are wrong so a lot of work would have to go into why its moving against me \n\non a couple other positions it has moved against me in the short term but then i have been right in the end of the day weathering those storms is no joke though especially if you have a meaningful amount of money on the line this is why i always stress the importance of knowing your stuff before scaling up your trades\n\n conclusion\n\nby knowing how to price the level of implied volatility you can develop really strong ideas that can yield great returns this has been one of my primary strategies this year especially with the meme stock craze tensions in china etc \n\n important point\n\nthis is not about just selling high iv a lot of the times iv is high for a reason this is about pricing iv and selling when it is expensive\n\na lot of traders make the mistake of selling because its high but i hope this post helps you think different about volatility and gives you some ideas about where you can find a real edge in the market \n\nremember once you have an idea of where iv should be you can make a trade if its different than what the market is pricing\n\n if you have ay questions leave a comment and ill try my best to help \n\nhappy trading\n\n ag", "completion": "i feel so smart now [Sentiment: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.534, 'pos': 0.466, 'compound': 0.541}] [Keywords: ['feel so smart',

answer questions so please ask if you have any\n\nprevious parts of this series     read these and it will hopefully lay some groundwork for this post\n\n it all starts with idea generation\n\nthis is where i find a lot of people struggle but it should actually be one of the easiest parts of strategy development \n\nfor you to have a profitable system you just need to be better than the next guy it doesnt need to be super fancy or complicated \n\nthink about it like you are an electrician in your local town currently theres some guy making all the money for fixes in the area if you can find some

ideas dont make money execution is what makes money \n\nnote your idea cant be too general it cant just be i want to sell options it needs to be more specific with that being said it doesnt need to be something super complex \n\nat this point we are just deciding on something we want to investigate \n\nexamples of good things to explore\n\n is the implied variance risk premium higher on etfs than stocks\n where is the variance risk premium the highest across us equities\n is selling vol on tech stocks and buying vol on finance a good pairs trade\n can we forecast earnings straddle pnls\n\n a trading edge has distinct characteristics\n\nbelow is a list of different things that can lead to an edge in the market i share these to spark some ideas so that you can think about where you should look for an edge given your unique situation\n\nxb\n\n data access do you have access to better data that no one else does example imagine the number of species in the marianas trench could predict tomorrows spy price well no one has that data so if you did you would have more knowledge than everyone else and youd make the most money \n skillsets if you are competing in a very low capacity space where there is lots of individuals and not so many teams having strong data science skills pull in data manipulate and transform the data  could give you an edge and help you build your trading business \n your network do you have access to people who can give you good ideas example private equity deals  having a network of professional traders to collab with etc \n specialization if you are a corporate lawyer can you figure out ma deals better than the next guy if you work in small cap tech can you figure out software development cycles and product release dates better than the next guy are you a doctor who understands biotech better than the next guy\n geography you can only trade certain products when you live in certain places this also incorporates regulatory issues too \n being first to an idea i guess this is the reinventing the wheel point this is a pretty competitive route to take but for example when new products are released no body really knows how to price it efficiently so there is room for you to come in and take a stab at pricing it better than the next guy \n liquidity constraints using your capital size to your advantage warren buffett once said if he had a million dollars he could do  a year and that is because he could take the same ideas he uses and use them on lower cap stocks which are less efficiently priced so where can we go that the big players cant dont try to find food in the ocean find a pond with lots of small fish \n high barrier to entry due to infrastructure we cant really just go and start a high frequency trading firm the infrastructure for this is insane so if you have it you could have an edge \n risk tolerance do we have a higher risk tolerance than the next guy and can therefore take trades  with more pnl variance that others maybe avoid cant take example a volatility hedge fund might not want to deploy a strategy with  daily swings even if the expected value is huge \n\nthose are some characteristics of a good edge idea and hopefully it gives you some ideas \n\nin another post i will go into my strategy for earnings trading as a follow up example to this the reason i am exploring earnings is because there is a lot of retail interest its tricky to model well and theres likely to be a variance risk premium \n\n building your strategy\n\n  pick what you are trying to predictforecast \n\nsomething really important to note is that whenever you are placing a trade it is your opinion vs the market there is somebody on the other side of your trade taking on the opposite view of you \n\nsince we are trading our ideas against the market it means we are expressing a disagreement with the markets view on things so whether we know it or not we have some sort of forecast or predicting on how things should be priced being conscious about what we are trying to predict is very important \n\nfor example if we are trading earnings volatility what we might be trying to predict is the straddle pnl and if we can identify when they are cheapexpensive we can build a strategy \n\nwhat we are trying to predict is referred to as your target variable \n\n not why but whether\n\nonce we have an idea or something we want to forecast we dont want to ask why does this exist we start by asking whether this exists \n\nso many retail traders fall into this trap they say this sounds like a good idea because of a b and c reasons im going to trade it \n\nbut we cant ask why it exists until we confirm whether it does \n\nthis part usually requires some pretty serious data science skills a workaround for retail is to look at academic papers for ideas or surround yourself with people who have the skills \n\na good place to research is \n\n what should we try to predict\n\nwhat we try to predict is important heres an example to illustrate \n\nits hard to predict the score between west ham and manchester united  an ok team and an allstar team but its not so difficult to predict who the winner is likely to be \n\nso for our trading sometimes we dont need to be trying to forecast the exact move we can start by just focusing on the bias\n\nso from a basic perspective if we are trying to forecast whether a stock has an inflated risk premium in its options they are expensive we can look at some data points that help us predict cheapexpensive a fair value on volatility and a reason for it but then in our execution we can be less married to our fair value target price and trade the cheapexpensive bias more consistently \n\n  determine the factors that help us with our prediction\n\nimagine you are trying to predict the amount of horsepower that a car has in your model the target variable would be horsepower but what can help us predict horsepower\n\n whether the car is a v or v\n the colour of the car\n rear front or all wheel drive\n number of doors\n\nlets say we determine that the  points above are good indicators of a cars horsepower these would then become our predictor variables \n\nyou can think of predictor variables as the checklist of things we go over when trying to make a conclusion about our target variable \n\nexample if a car has a v engine red paint rear wheel drive and  doors its probably over hp \n\n consulting the data\n\nif you want to be able to do this on a professional level you will need to develop your data science skills being able to work with and manipulate data is the equivalent of knowing how to type in the professional space its not an edge but its basically expected that you know it \n\nin the retail space most of us here its a nice to have and not a need to have so yes knowing it can be an advantage but its not a necessity \n\ni will focus on how to do this with no coding background unless enough traders want to see the other part \n\n an example of trading a strategy being implemented\n\nnote a lot of you ask what tools i use a lot of the base data points and scans that i rely on are from predicting alpha i then use think or swim to stress and analyze positions i execute trades in interactive brokers \n\nthe reason i use these platforms is they a provide me with analytics tools that ease the burden of needing data science skills b let me analyze my positions in depth before putting them on c offer me the best commissions and execution on my trades\n\nfor this strategy i am sharing in this example i am trading the difference between the implied and realized volatilities for us equities because of the variance risk premium and increased retail interest i aim to build out a model that helps me identify overpriced options\n\n lets start by defining my target and predictor variables\n\n target variable realized volatility over the next  days for a stock\n\n predictor variables current realized volatility last  days current implied volatility  day current future forecast of volatility  day current ivdrvd spread\n\nthrough my own research and things ive learned the set of predictor variables i listed above are good at telling me about what realized volatility will look like over next  days\n\nfor each of those factors i am trying to determine if they are high or low relative to the historic metrics except for the volatility forecast which is something a bit different basically a statistical forecast of the future \n\nbeyond each of these factors i will look at the news to add a more qualitative component to my analysis i want to understand why i am seeing what i do \n\n  start with a scan\n\ni started by running a scan for a stock that had some liquidity and an iv  forecast by at least x i also added a filter for iv to get rid of stocks that werent implying much to happen\n\nthe reason i do this is that the market has way too many things to look at and its efficient to use a scanner to filter from s of equities down to a shortlist of things that meet a base criteria for your strategy \n\n\n\nxb\n\nby doing so i generated a list of  stocks to look at given the time of year most of these stocks have earnings around  days from now so i had to be careful to avoid ones with big earnings moves priced in since i am really trying to trade the non event volatility most of these stocks have a bit of earnings vol priced in on the dte options\n\nthe stock i chose for this analysis is grpn groupon \n\n  evaluate your predictor variables\n\niv rv and forecast  analysis\n\niv  \n\nrv  \n\nfv  \n\niv is over x fv this is my expensive indicator for the fv predictor variable\n\noff the bat this is looking good iv much higher than rv and forecast this is usually a strong sign for sell options\n\nto move on lets plot the historic iv and rv to see how they are moving relative to each other \n\n\n\nif we plot the historic iv and rv we can see that for the last while there has been a consistent premium of iv over rv this is my expensive indicator for iv and rv\n\none cause for concern we can see that iv has continued to rise despite the lower realized volatility which means that someone is still a buyer at these levels and could be a slight cause for concern i would definitely want to do somme digging into the company to see whats happening around it and try to hypothesize about who could be buying here \n\none last point we will look at here is if this ratio between iv and rv is normal or if its at an extreme \n\nas i described in a previous  think of iv and rv as being in a dance together they take turns leading the dance but they try to stay in step with each other\n\nso looking at how they move together we usually see it mean reverts around a comfortable spread between the two if one strays too far from the other they move closer together if they move too close together they push further apart\n\n here is the iv  rv ratio for grpn over the last year\n\n\n\nas we can see the ivrv spread is towards the top of the range meaning they are far apart right now so we can expect either rv to pick up or iv to come down or them to meet in the middle theres other combinations of possibilities but lets keep it simple\n\nif we look back at the first graph we see that rv has remained the same while iv has been moving up so i could conclude that perhaps it will meet somewhere in the middle iv comes down a bit rv goes up a bit but below the current iv line this is my expensive indicator for ivrv ratio predictor variable\n\n if we look at all the variables they check the boxes for the realized volatility to be lower than the implied aka iv is expensive \n\nnow as mentioned theres some qualitative research into the news sentiment whos trading this to really build some qualitative confidence too but assuming that checks out i would be selling options here\n\n from here i would put on a trade that properly express my view that volatility is expensive maybe a straddle \n\ni will go more in depth on structuring and managing trades in a later post its a whole topic on its own\n\n these are the basics of good strategy development and finding an edge in trading \n\ni hope that this post has given you some ideas and insights into the world of profitable trading it might seem like over kill but i promise that i do not go out of my way to to make things complicated we actually want things to be as simple as can be while still being profitable \n\nan important thing to note is that you can actually do all of this work and still lose money trading its a tough game we need to always be improving looking for new ideas always on the hunt for that better edge \n\n if you found this post

with and manipulate data is the equivalent of knowing how to type in the professional space its not an edge but its basically expected that you know it \n\nin the retail space most of us here its a nice to have and not a need to have so yes knowing it can be an advantage but its not a necessity \n\ni will focus on how to do this with no coding background unless enough traders want to see the other part \n\n an example of trading a strategy being implemented\n\nnote a lot of you ask what tools i use a lot of the base data points and scans that i rely on are from predicting alpha i then use think or swim to stress and analyze positions i execute trades in interactive brokers \n\nthe reason i use these platforms is they a provide me with analytics tools that ease the burden of needing data science skills b let me analyze my positions in depth before putting them on c offer me the best commissions and execution on my trades\n\nfor this strategy i am sharing in this example i am trading the difference between the implied and realized volatilities for us equities because of the variance risk premium and increased retail interest i aim to build out a model that helps me identify overpriced options\n\n lets start by defining my target and predictor variables\n\n target variable realized volatility over the next  days for a stock\n\n predictor variables current realized volatility last  days current implied volatility  day current future forecast of volatility  day current ivdrvd spread\n\nthrough my own research and things ive learned the set of predictor variables i listed above are good at telling me about what realized volatility will look like over next  days\n\nfor each of those factors i am trying to determine if they are high or low relative to the historic metrics except for the volatility forecast which is something a bit different basically a statistical forecast of the future \n\nbeyond each of these factors i will look at the news to add a more qualitative component to my analysis i want to understand why i am seeing what i do \n\n  start with a scan\n\ni started by running a scan for a stock that had some liquidity and an iv  forecast by at least x i also added a filter for iv to get rid of stocks that werent implying much to happen\n\nthe reason i do this is that the market has way too many things to look at and its efficient to use a scanner to filter from s of equities down to a shortlist of things that meet a base criteria for your strategy \n\n\n\nxb\n\nby doing so i generated a list of  stocks to look at given the time of year most of these stocks have earnings around  days from now so i had to be careful to avoid ones with big earnings moves priced in since i am really trying to trade the non event volatility most of these stocks have a bit of earnings vol priced in on the dte options\n\nthe stock i chose for this analysis is grpn groupon \n\n  evaluate your predictor variables\n\niv rv and forecast  analysis\n\niv  \n\nrv  \n\nfv  \n\niv is over x fv this is my expensive indicator for the fv predictor variable\n\noff the bat this is looking good iv much higher than rv and forecast this is usually a strong sign for sell options\n\nto move on lets plot the historic iv and rv to see how they are moving relative to each other \n\n\n\nif we plot the historic iv and rv we can see that for the last while there has been a consistent premium of iv over rv this is my expensive indicator for iv and rv\n\none cause for concern we can see that iv has continued to rise despite the lower realized volatility which means that someone is still a buyer at these levels and could be a slight cause for concern i would definitely want to do somme digging into the company to see whats happening around it and try to hypothesize about who could be buying here \n\none last point we will look at here is if this ratio between iv and rv is normal or if its at an extreme \n\nas i described in a previous  think of iv and rv as being in a dance together they take turns leading the dance but they try to stay in step with each other\n\nso looking at how they move together we usually see it mean reverts around a comfortable spread between the two if one strays too far from the other they move closer together if they move too close together they push further apart\n\n here is the iv  rv ratio for grpn over the last year\n\n\n\nas we can see the ivrv spread is towards the top of the range meaning they are far apart right now so we can expect either rv to pick up or iv to come down or them to meet in the middle theres other combinations of possibilities but lets keep it simple\n\nif we look back at the first graph we see that rv has remained the same while iv has been moving up so i could conclude that perhaps it will meet somewhere in the middle iv comes down a bit rv goes up a bit but below the current iv line this is my expensive indicator for ivrv ratio predictor variable\n\n if we look at all the variables they check the boxes for the realized volatility to be lower than the implied aka iv is expensive \n\nnow as mentioned theres some qualitative research into the news sentiment whos trading this to really build some qualitative confidence too but assuming that checks out i would be selling options here\n\n from here i would put on a trade that properly express my view that volatility is expensive maybe a straddle \n\ni will go more in depth on structuring and managing trades in a later post its a whole topic on its own\n\n these are the basics of good strategy development and finding an edge in trading \n\ni hope that this post has given you some ideas and insights into the world of profitable trading it might seem like over kill but i promise that i do not go out of my way to to make things complicated we actually want things to be as simple as can be while still being profitable \n\nan important thing to note is that you can actually do all of this work and still lose money trading its a tough game we need to always be improving looking for new ideas always on the hunt for that better edge \n\n if you found this post valuable please upvote it as that gives me ideas about what i should write about in my next post \n\nhappy trading everyone\n\nag", "completion": "am finding that my edge is\n\n having patient capital

{"prompt": "in this post i go into detail on  what a trading edge looks like  how to build a strategy  an example of executing a strategy \n\nthis post is a bit trickier than some of the others i have made and will make in the future but dont let that discourage you \n\ntrading is a competition in the end of the day it attracts very smart people to play and theres no free lunch ill be around to answer questions so please ask if you have any\n\nprevious parts of this series     read these and it will hopefully lay some groundwork for this post\n\n it all starts with idea generation\n\nthis is where i find a lot of people struggle but it should actually be one of the easiest parts of strategy development \n\nfor you to have a profitable system you just need to be better than the next guy it doesnt need to be super fancy or complicated \n\nthink about it like you are an electrician in your local town currently theres some guy making all the money for fixes in the area if you can find some sort of advantage now youll be the guy making all the money maybe you can get jobs done faster maybe you sell better maybe your price is lower \n\nnote an idea alone is worthless just like in business ideas dont make money execution is what makes money \n\nnote your idea cant be too general it cant just be i want to sell options it needs to be more specific with that being said it doesnt need to be something super complex \n\nat this point we are just deciding on something we want to investigate \n\nexamples of good things to explore\n\n is the implied variance risk premium higher on etfs than stocks\n where is the variance risk premium the highest across us equities\n is selling vol on tech stocks and buying vol on finance a good pairs trade\n can we forecast earnings straddle pnls\n\n a trading edge has distinct characteristics\n\nbelow is a list of different things that can lead to an edge in the market i share these to spark some ideas so that you can think about where you should look for an edge given your unique situation\n\nxb\n\n data access do you have access to better data that no one else does example imagine the number of species in the marianas trench could predict tomorrows spy price well no one has that data so if you did you would have more knowledge than everyone else and youd make the most money \n skillsets if you are competing in a very low capacity space where there is lots of individuals and not so many teams having strong data science skills pull in data manipulate and transform the data  could give you an edge and help you build your trading business \n your network do you have access to people who can give you good ideas example private equity deals  having a network of professional traders to collab with etc \n specialization if you are a corporate lawyer can you figure out ma deals better than the next guy if you work in small cap tech can you figure out software development cycles and product release dates better than the next guy are you a doctor who understands biotech better than the next guy\n geography you can only trade certain products when you live in certain places this also incorporates regulatory issues too \n being first to an idea i guess this is the reinventing the wheel point this is a pretty competitive route to take but for example when new products are released no body really knows how to price it efficiently so there is room for you to come in and take a stab at pricing it better than the next guy \n liquidity constraints using your capital size to your advantage warren buffett once said if he had a million dollars he could do  a year and that is because he could take the same ideas he uses and use them on lower cap stocks which are less efficiently priced so where can we go that the big players cant dont try to find food in the ocean find a pond with lots of small fish \n high barrier to entry due to infrastructure we cant really just go and start a high frequency trading firm the infrastructure for this is insane so if you have it you could have an edge \n risk tolerance do we have a higher risk tolerance than the next guy and can therefore take trades  with more pnl variance that others maybe avoid cant take example a volatility hedge fund might not want to deploy a strategy with  daily swings even if the expected value is huge \n\nthose are some characteristics of a good edge idea and hopefully it gives you some ideas \n\nin another post i will go into my strategy for earnings trading as a follow up example to this the reason i am exploring earnings is because there is a lot of retail interest its tricky to model well and theres likely to be a variance risk premium \n\n building your strategy\n\n  pick what you are trying to predictforecast \n\nsomething really important to note is that whenever you are placing a trade it is your opinion vs the market there is somebody on the other side of your trade taking on the opposite view of you \n\nsince we are trading our ideas against the market it means we are expressing a disagreement with the markets view on things so whether we know it or not we have some sort of forecast or predicting on how things should be priced being conscious about what we are trying to predict is very important \n\nfor example if we are trading earnings volatility what we might be trying to predict is the straddle pnl and if we can identify when they are cheapexpensive we can build a strategy \n\nwhat we are trying to predict is referred to as your target variable \n\n not why but whether\n\nonce we have an idea or something we want to forecast we dont want to ask why does this exist we start by asking whether this exists \n\nso many retail traders fall into this trap they say this sounds like a good idea because of a b and c reasons im going to trade it \n\nbut we cant ask why it exists until we confirm whether it does \n\nthis part usually requires some pretty serious data science skills a workaround for retail is to look at academic papers for ideas or surround yourself with people who have the skills \n\na good place to research is \n\n what should we try to predict\n\nwhat we try to predict is important heres an example to illustrate \n\nits hard to predict the score between west ham and manchester united  an ok team and an allstar team but its not so difficult to predict who the winner is likely to be \n\nso for our trading sometimes we dont need to be trying to forecast the exact move we can start by just focusing on the bias\n\nso from a basic perspective if we are trying to forecast whether a stock has an inflated risk premium in its options they are expensive we can look at some data points that help us predict cheapexpensive a fair value on volatility and a reason for it but then in our execution we can be less married to our fair value target price and trade the cheapexpensive bias more consistently \n\n  determine the factors that help us with our prediction\n\nimagine you are trying to predict the amount of horsepower that a car has in your model the target variable would be horsepower but what can help us predict horsepower\n\n whether the car is a v or v\n the colour of the car\n rear front or all wheel drive\n number of doors\n\nlets say we determine that the  points above are good indicators of a cars horsepower these would then become our predictor variables \n\nyou can think of predictor variables as the checklist of things we go over when trying to make a conclusion about our target variable \n\nexample if a car has a v engine red paint rear wheel drive and  doors its probably over hp \n\n consulting the data\n\nif you want to be able to do this on a professional level you will need to develop your data science skills being able to work

categories for an edge which is industry knowledge  im extremely techheavy in my portfolio and have been for years however ive made some huge gains by getting in to companies early on because i work in tech so i know it better than most people  i know why aws is winning in the cloud space because i use it every day  i can usually tell if a tech company is going to be successful longterm based on their products too  for example i saw a demo of ddogs product at a conference before they even went public and i could tell instantly that this thing was pure gold since it could answer questions that ive struggled with solving for the previous  years of my career and was even capable of doing something in the security field not their intended purpose that i had only theorized was possible but i knew would be invaluable once everyone else realized this i pointed it out to the guy doing the demo as well and the use case had never even occurred to him  i know what brands of cpus my peers at other similar companies are buying for their highperformance computing clusters and why plus the drives networking gizmos etc and theres a reason that im jacked almost to the tits about amd going forward along with a few other companies  finally if hashicorp ever goes public i will you only live once that shit so hard that even wsb will be impressed because their products are some of the best that ive ever used and i think almost everyone in the industry would probably agree with me  \n\n\nnow some of this probably falls under network as you mentioned since i certainly leverage the opinions of my peers in tech when making some of these decisions  however trading companies in an industry that you intimately understand is definitely an edge and has served me well for a very long time  sure there are big firms out there that will do their dd and have quants with decades of experience to actually do it but even then the quants are going to ask people like me about a companys products and i can guarantee that one of their quants wouldnt be able to look at ddog and have their eyes light up during their demo because they can finally give me a solution that ive wished i had for the previous  years  i realize that im also glossing over things like revenue and how a company is run overall here and in reality i can still take those things into account to a certain extent  its not too hard to look at a smaller tech company and determine if theyre going to crash and burn because they cant run a company  i cant tell if theyll succeed in general but i can definitely tell if they wont based on how they run their dev process this seems like it would be difficult to determine but in reality ive found that i can usually make a pretty good guess and ive never been wrong before so i think that along with the usefulness of their offerings is enough to make a pretty good case in terms of fundamentals [Sentiment: {'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound':
