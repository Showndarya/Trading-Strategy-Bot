options market,investing,Money Market Fund Option at Edward Jones?,"Recently looked into a Money Market Fund with Edward Jones.

Is this a good investment option and/or institution for 100-150k?

 - I am looking for low risk (almost 0) 
 - Fairly liquid (a few days to withdraw with no penalties
 - Decent return.  I was told by them 4.5% return after they take their fee.

Is there is better option with the above 3 criteria?

(Posting in several areas to get opinions)

EDIT: Going with Vanguards VMFXX.",2,The best thing for you to do would be to leave Edward Jones. They are garbage.,You can get ~5% in most MMF or around 5.2% in 3 month treasury ETF.  EJ is fleecing you in more ways than one.,"There is no point in buying MMFs at EJ. They do not have good options for that.

EJ is a horrible place to invest unless someone is clueless about how to do it on their own. Their fees are very high."
options market,investing,Goldman Says Options Market Pushing Election Risk to December,"Option traders are tempering bets that volatility will spike in the stock market immediately after the U.S. election. Instead, they’re boosting wagers that price swings will stay elevated at least one month after the vote, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Options on the S&P 500 pointed to a 2.8% move on Nov. 4, the day after the presidential vote, down from an implied 3.2% swing seen in August, according to the bank’s analysis. What’s also shifting is the curve in futures tied to the CBOE Volatility Index.

Specifically, VIX’s November contracts, which refer to volatility during the month through Dec. 18, have jumped above October ones for the first time this year, a sign that traders are adding protections well beyond Election Day, said Goldman strategists led by Ben Snider.

“Option markets seem to have abandoned the view that volatility would rise strongly in the lead-up to the election, which had been priced in throughout much of 2020,” the strategists wrote in a note to clients. “Instead, currently markets are expecting volatility to jump at Election Day, and then remain high thereafter.”

The focus on extended volatility may mark a change in sentiment toward election risks. In early August, Binky Chadha, chief global strategist at Deutsche Bank, warned that options traders were too sanguine positioning for a steep post-election drop in the VIX.

Potential Delay

The latest shift in volatility pricing reflects the potential for delays in counting ballots and for results to be disputed, according to Goldman. A key date during the process is Dec. 8, known as a “safe harbor” deadline for when states have to resolve any controversies related to the appointment of their electors to the Electoral College, and six days before electors cast final votes on Dec. 14 to determine the outcome.

In 2000, the contested George Bush-Al Gore election results were decided on Dec. 12 after the Supreme Court ended a Florida vote recount ahead of the Electoral deadline. Republicans have floated a bill that seeks to extend the safe harbor and Electoral College meeting into January.

“The level of implied volatility sends a clear message: The election matters for equities, and the outcome is highly uncertain,” Snider said.
One industry -- health care -- appears particularly shielded from the turmoil. With developments in the race for Covid-19 vaccines at the top of investor’s minds, health care appears to be more buffered against broader market volatility than any other sector, save industrials, according to Goldman.

October VIX futures, which expire before Election Day but are priced off options that include Election Day, have less upside than the November future, they wrote, adding that November VIX optionality should be more valuable than October VIX options and recommends trades in VIX option calendars.
This is how Goldman suggests investors brace for the turmoil:

Sell VIX Oct. $27 puts and buy Nov. $27 puts for $1.05 per contract versus reference prices of the Oct. future of $30.40 and the Nov. future of $30.80

For investors wanting to hedge, they recommend selling VIX Oct. $35 calls and buying Nov. $35 calls for $1.25 per contract

options market,investing,SoftBank unmasked as ‘Nasdaq whale’ that stoked tech rally - Financial Times,"[https://on.ft.com/3gUWUIZ](https://on.ft.com/3gUWUIZ)  


&#x200B;

SoftBank is the “Nasdaq whale” that has bought billions of dollars’ worth of US equity derivatives in a move that stoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks before a sharp pullback on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Japanese conglomerate has been snapping up options in tech stocks during the past month in huge amounts, contributing to the largest trading volumes in contracts linked to individual companies in at least 10 years, these people said. One banker described it as a “dangerous” bet.

The aggressive move into the options market marks a new chapter for the investment powerhouse, which in recent years has made huge bets on privately held technology start-ups through its $100bn Vision Fund. After the coronavirus market tumult hit those bets hard, the company established an asset management unit for public investments using capital contributed by its founder Masayoshi Son.

Now it has also made a splash in trading derivatives linked to some of those new investments, which has shocked market veterans. “These are some of the biggest trades I’ve seen in 20 years of doing this,” said one derivatives-focused US hedge fund manager. “The flow is huge.”

The surge in purchases of call options — derivatives that give the user the right to buy a stock at a pre-agreed price — has been the talk of Wall Street in recent weeks, as the sheer size of the trades appears to have exacerbated a “melt-up” in many big technology stocks over the summer. Shares in Tesla soared 26 per cent in under a week to September 1, while Amazon and Google parent Alphabet gained about 9 per cent.

One person familiar with SoftBank’s trades said it was “gobbling up” options on a scale that was even making some people within the organisation nervous. “People are caught with their pants down, massively short. This can continue. The whale is still hungry.”

The options boom means that the US stock market remains vulnerable to further bursts of volatility, according to Charlie McElligott, a strategist at Nomura. “The street is still very much in a dangerous space, and that flow is still out there,” he said in a note on Friday, adding that this leaves the market open to swings higher or lower.

The overall nominal value of calls traded on individual US stocks has averaged $335bn a day over the past two weeks, according to Goldman Sachs. That is more than triple the rolling average in 2017 to 2019. The retail trading boom has played a big part of the frenzy, but investors say the size of many recent option purchases are far too big to be retail-driven.",736,"So, Softbank is r/WSB?","As of time of posting:

As inflation picks up, we already know the FED will have to increase interest rates. The question is - how do we invest with this in mind? I’ve been questioning this for months now. 

I’ve heard two theories. The first states that inflation is no real concern for the stock market in general, in fact it states it’s actually good for the stock market. 

The second theory states that as inflation rises there tends to be an inverse relationship to stock market growth, and specifically company P/E ratios. Growth stocks tend to lose ground as P/E ratios come back down to earth. 

I tend to believe the second theory as it makes more sense to me. Low interest rates and easy money for the past decade have fueled a magnificent bull run. As rates go up, and money tightens, I believe we’ll likely see a pullback or correction in the market. To what extent? I do not know. 

So what do we do with this information? Which stocks or sectors do well during inflationary increases? From my research it’s been energy, oil, commodities, and gold. Will this trend prove to be true once again?

1) What is this phenomenon called?

2) Did some successful companies that also experienced this phenomenon started to slowly grow after months or maybe years?

3) What are the chances that buying stocks of such companies - when their price reached this sort of stabilization, and very low prices and mkt cap - you will face an increase in price if the company is considered not extremely so bad bad bad from its financials?

4) Why do the prices of these stocks usually plummet so suddenly, even though experienced institutions have determined that the value of that company should be for example 10/20 times higher?

5) If someone really wants to invest in such a small company (small cap, no history, low volume, limited financials), is this the correct time to open a long position or is better to just don’t consider at all stocks that lost 80/90% in few months from IPO?

stocks,investing,Technology stocks are crashing – what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio.

Capital losses offset all capital gains, and then you get the $3,000/yr and carry forward the rest.","Say you have $80k in realized capital gains and $90k in unrealized capital loss. Using tax-loss harvesting, the total realized capital gains can be changed into a $10k realized capital loss by realizing the example unrealized capital loss.

In this example, we avoid paying taxes in $80k realized gains, and get to deduct $3k from ordinary income, and carry forward $7k of capital loss that can be applied against future capital gains as well as $3k in deductions against ordinary income.

Then, we just avoid the wash sale and rebuy the losing position since we would have kept it otherwise. And we keep the carry forward. (""Tax-loss harvesting"")",I think you miss the point: You can CARRY OVER the loss and deduct every year if needed.

year,investing,"7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k","I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.",1459,That's why they say the first 100k is the hardest.

This could be due to unexpected financial situation on the part of either company or due to a regulatory problem, such as the government blocking a deal due to anti-trust (monopoly) concerns. Deals fall through sometimes. It's just something that happens. 

A small portion is probably related to the issue of having capital tied up for X months knowing it will never exceed the deal price.","Risk premium and time value of money. You can model it in a manner analogous to options premium. 

If this interests you I'd suggest you look at pricing data of any acquisition. Pricing can actually go above the buyout if the market thinks the buy out is undervalued (very rare).

stock price,investing,How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?,"**How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?**

Is there a stock as ridiculously underpriced as Citi (C)? Before the 2007-2008 crisis, Citi was trading at around $500/share and then abruptly crashed down to prices as low as $15/share before moderately rebounding to around $40/share in late 2009. Since 2009, Citi has been trading within the range of $40-$80/share despite enormous growth in the company's financials. Citi currently trades at roughly $50/share despite yielding annual free cash flows (FCFs) which are far, far, far greater than they ever did when its stock price was roughly $500/share. They had FCFs of \~$57 billion in 2021! And the 2022 Q1 report makes the rest of the year look extremely promising. If you took their Q1 2022 Net Income, ""extrapolated"" that figure for the entirety of 2022 by multiplying it by 4, and assumed the same Net Income/Free Cash Flow ratio as seen in 2021, you'd get a FCF number equal to around $44 billion! Both their actual 2021 FCF figure and this 2022 estimate are drastic improvements from prior years. But keep in mind that this ""back-of-the-envelope"" estimation calculation is most likely an underestimation for one big reason:

**RISING INTEREST RATES**

Banks make more money when interest rates rise. The Fed is raising and will continue to raise interest rates to recent records to combat the recent bout of inflation. Banks such as Citi stand to gain enormously from this.

Yet for some reason, the Fed's announcement of interest rate hikes in March barely had an effect on Citi's stock.

EDIT: Additionally, Warren Buffett recently invested an enormous amount in Citi, but that had very little effect on its stock price.

Every single DCF model I've seen of Citi yield Equity/Share values that are far, far, far higher than what the stock is currently trading for. Analysts widely seem to agree that Citi is undervalued and has been for several years.

Just for fun, I took the Free Cash Flows generated by Citi from 1989-2021 and used the Excel forecast function to use that data to create a forecast for the next 10 years within a 95% confidence interval. Thereafter, I took those FCF forecasts and used the ""terminal value"" method to come up with a NPV Enterprise value for the company (assuming a 5.5% WACC, as calculated by valueinvesting.io). I took this figure and subtracted the company's net debt to arrive at an equity value for the company. Afterward, I divided this equity value and divided it by Citi's shares outstanding. This is essentially how DCF models calculate a stock's ""intrinsic"" price. I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$254.68/share.**

But that's not all! I also did the same thing but used the FCF forecasts from the Lower Confidence Bound (meaning Excel is 95% sure that the actual values will be higher than these values). Thereafter, I averaged the results from the median forecast and the worst-case scenario (as it is extremely unlikely that Citi will actually yield FCF of around -$35 billion for every single year for the next 10 years). Averaging the median forecasts and the worst-case forecasts, I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$56.55/share**! Keep in mind that this is basically the most realistic **worst-case scenario** for Citi's future FCFs.

**Citi is currently trading at $46.35/share.**

I've done tons of DCF models and my ""intrinsic value"" figure always ends up being pretty close to the actual stock price. This is virtually the only exception. How on Earth is Citi only trading at $46.35/share!? How is that even possible!? Why isn't the stock price soaring?",273,What cash flow exactly are you discounting here? Cash flow is their operational business - you can't value a bank like that.,"You shouldn’t use DCF to find the intrinsic value of banks. Banks are highly levered and figuring out the proper FCF to use is a nightmare. Enterprise values should not be used to value commercial banks either, as a large cash balance might even leave some with a negative EV. 

Using the dividend discount model might help get “closer” to their current price.","Because of the street’s lack of confidence in their leadership.

Price doesn't matter for first 10% entry. Once you have purchased a small amount, then you buy at whatever price you feel comfortable at. If that price never comes and it keeps going up atleast you won't feel fomo about missing out as atleast you own a little bit. It really helps psychologically and is a very sound investing technique which very few people follow."

Before I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:

I wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.

People have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.

Alright, so, today's action.

I have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.

In my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.

I tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.

One thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.

There was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.

I got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).

# The Game (Theory)

Ok, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?

Possibly.

I say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.

Ok, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?

In simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.

# Power

For most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.

Today, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.

Being in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.

If you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.

I don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.

# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk

Many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.

Some people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.

Others trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.

Others are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.

I think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.

# Swimming In The Deep

So, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.

One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.

Another question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.

All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.

If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.

Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.

If the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.

If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!

Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.

Apologies for the lengthy post again.  Good luck in the market!",3836,"I have a question while I wait to read this post. This may be a stupid question. I'm a long term investor and never pay attention to stuff like this. So if I'm understanding the situation here correctly, reported SI is down from over ~120% to 50-60% according to Ortex and S3 over the weekend. People are unconvinced as there is not enough volume for the shorts to cover in that time (and shouldn't the price move up instead of down if they're buying hard to get stocks?). Institutional investors hold a large amount of the stock, so could the shorts in theory cut a deal with the long institutional investors to cover at a more reasonable rate? If that's possible, would the market volume reflect that deal?

When GME first hit about 300 there were reports that Blackrock had already made billions of dollars. I think that this has been the truth all along.

And people have been railing against the media for backing the institutional investors and being mad at retail for beating the big guy at his own game. In fact, the media is perpetuating this bad-optics lie because the truth is even worse: not only did WSB not beat the big guys at their own game, they were never even playing in the first place. Now people think that retail investors are much more powerful than we really are. Again, this is a very useful lie for institutional investors.","As usual I'm late to the conversation. I do want to say that with all the WSB fervor this has been a tremendous learning experience for me. I've been investing play money little by little on RH for two years now. I've learned more about the details of investing over this weekend than I have over the last two years. Like others I watched *The Big Short* and have *All the Devils are Here* waiting on my shelf to be read. Because of all the Robinhood drama, I opened an Fidelity brokerage account, which my retirement happens to be with as well. I can now keep track of it better through the app. For me, there is a lot of secondary and tertiary good things coming out of this situation. 

I may have bought a handful of shares in a certain movie theater chain and I may be holding them with a grip made out of compressed carbon. They have been playing old movies for $5 cheap. I've seen awesome ones like T2, Goldfinger, Alien, and The Empire Strikes Back— I think that's great they've been doing that and I hope they keep it up. On the other hand, I'm not the type of person to dump all of my savings into an emotional craze. I set a low-ball limit buy and waited.

2 - Unsubscribe from this sub

No! This is how you catch CoVID-19!","Unlike speculations or other types of bubbles or news that make the market go down, a corona pandemic is the kind of thing that actually affects the underlying revenue of the market - people don't go to cinema, don't go on cruises, companies don't make money, go bankrupt, etc... 

If you believe in any way that the value of a stock is correlated to the underlying revenue and assets of a company (which it should), then it makes perfect sense that the market goes down, not only because of panic sell, but realistically, there will be months with no revenue or negative revenue for a lot of companies, so their value, as a multiple of that, has to reflect that.

Yes, things will bounce back again of course and it will go back to normal, but it will not ""make up"" for 6 months or so when people didn't use the companies services. Like if people don't go to cinema for 6 months because of fear of virus, they won't say after it's done, ok, now we go 3 times per week to cinema to make up for how much we missed, they'll just resume going to cinema regularly.

strategy,investing,"Spreadsheet to calculate GME Exit Strategy, ROI Calculations & Breakeven Analysis","**PLEASE DROP AN UPVOTE AND/OR COMMENT IF YOU USE. IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

strategy,investing,"A story about the Dot Com bubble, some profit taking, exit strategies and money vs capital","
[ Bot hates me so here is a link](http://www.bloomberg.com/news)

In the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally (this is not nearly as bad though, so chill, companies are actually destroying the estimates and profits are strong).

Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's mainly electric vehicles and some parts of tech. 

“St0nks” were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one). 

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness and a trainee spot at Deutsche Bank's analyst desk. My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. 

Everybody is a genious in a bull market, you put some money in to a company in IT and BAM, the new Buffett (or Cathie).

Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point, not bad for a student. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

The ""dip"" came. Eli figured ""st0nks only go up"" - I'm gonna ""buy the dip"". The dip became a slide, then a vortex and finally evolving in to a capital sucking black hole (not an anus ok).

Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.



So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an strategy that I'm using myself.


1. I  usually don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I start scaling back profits and weight to other, new opportunities. The riskier the stock the earlier and more I scale back.

Compound that interest, bitch.

2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This capital has had a ridiculous payback over the years. This is not money, this is capital. I have a savings account with 3 months salary. That’s money. Money pays bills, capital grows.

3. For every 20% growth I take home for example 20% of the profit in riskier playa. So in G-ME for example I started buying early and by $90 I only had profits invested. By 300 I had sold about 2/3 and on the way down I dropped the last stocks at 115. 

So let’s say a stock grows from 100 to 120. I take back 4. Then it goes to 140, I take back another 8 so now I have taken 12 total. 

Obviously there is some flexibility here, but use it for inspiration. For more secure stocks you want to hold on more and longer, but for me it’s a lot about maintaining that cash position.


So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things. 


1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times.  For example, my G-ME winnings (yes it was a casino) paid for 300 PayPal stocks at $231. They’re now up 15%. 

Compound that interest, bitch.


2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%). Life saver in March, pure rocket fuel baby. 


3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  I turn it in to money. I have money so I can spend it, use it. 



Moral of the story or TLDR;

Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6-10 months. Its not coming back for a while. 

Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing earning calls or dips and remember: IT IS NOT MONEY UNTIL YOU SELL.

Disclaimer 2: I was a licensed financial advisor as in a securities analyst, but do your own research. This is not advice, it’s inspiration.

PS Eli went on to be a very successful entrepreneur and has started a few companies. I believe one of them is going to IPO soon DS

strategy,investing,What is your strategy for the coming rising interest rate environment?,"I am a fairly new investor, I began in 2017. It has obviously been a stellar few years, did covid even happen?

I have a close relationship with an old professor of mine (he has a doctorate in finance and has amassed serious wealth) who teaches investments at the college level, we often chat. He was a derivatives trader for 20 years back in the 80s and 90s.

He swears and insists that when rates begin to rise the market is going to absolutely eat shit, and most if not all valuations will drop. He says that the market has been hooked on the feds liquidity since ‘08 and the withdrawals will be severe. He has been slowly divesting the past few months.

I see where he is coming from, and he is obviously much wiser than me. In class he would always preach about if a stock falls 50% you need 100% gain to make your money back, therefore avoiding downside is much better than missing a little upside, which I also agree with.

What I am not so sure of is that rising rates will spell doom for the markets. The most I could see is maybe slowed growth? But if rates steadily climb to around 4% on the 10 year that would actually be GOOD For the economy.

Thoughts on this? Inb4 “long term time horizon I never sell”

Edit: following up due to traction. This guys worst year was 2000 where he made -2%, which still massively outperformed the market. I understand the never sell mentality, but look at the facts: rates are at rock bottom, QE is off the charts. There is literally only ONE direction the fed can go. I predict rates will begin to rise (slowly) at some point next year. If you had a chance to miss massive downside, would you take it? Can you use logic to make prudent investment decisions or are you locked into never mitigating risk? I am actually beginning to consider slowly exiting.

But seriously, your professor is divesting because he's old, and has to preserve his money. You, however, will lose more money trying to time the market than you ever could in a crash (for what it's worth, the same also applies to your prof). 

If prices go down 50%, that's fine. The market doubles every 7 to 10 years, so I'll make all my money back eventually, and then I'll have made a hefty gain by investing more at the bottom and riding it on the way up.

Secondly, the markets are down a fair amount right now. The S&P 500 is about 18% off it's all time high. Granted it went lower than that recently and historical has gone much lower in various crisis. But even if you bought today and it went down further, you've already locked in a pretty good discount. Buying in recessions, even if not all at the very bottom, almost always ends up a pretty good deal for the investor in the long run. So I wouldn't be worried if we haven't seen the bottom yet. Maybe we have, maybe we haven't. But to lock in a 18% off sale today is pretty hard to beat.

Historically it's pretty rare for the S&P to go farther than -20% so statistically speaking this is as good a time as any to dive in."
time,investing,Time Value of Money Question,"Hi Folks,

I'm having a bit of trouble wrapping my mind around a financial concept, and I would be extremely appreciate of any insight some of you might be able to offer.   


I'll do my best to explain the situation to you in a concise way. Here it goes:  


I'm trying to determine how much to invest each period in a long-term hold strategy. Specifically, I'm trying to make guesses with a time value of money calculator as to how much my investment will be worth in a few decades. For this example, I assume I'll receive 10% back on my investment per year (on average over many years) before inflation is accounted for. I'll also assume that inflation is 3% on average, per year. I have been viewing my investments as making 7% to account for the 3% inflation in my example. 

However, if I am letting money sit for a long period of time (let's say 30 years), and I invest $2,000 each month at the beginning of the period, it doesn't take long before the interest earned on the principle of my investment will far outpace my expected monthly cash outflows in my overall personal budget, adjusted for inflation.  


Does it seem proper to look at my investment as much x% rate of return - y% rate of inflation? I ask because what boggles my mind is the point where my investments earn more interest in a period than I plan to spend in that same period. I understand the idea that inflation will make a dollar in the future less valuable than a dollar today), but for some reason, I can't help but think that I might be missing a key concept about rate of return vs. inflation  since at some point, the inflation on my monthly consumptions won't keep pace with the interest earned on a large enough principal balance (inflation adjusted).  


I hope that this makes sense. I have an accounting background, and I should know the answer to this, but I don't and  it's been gnawing at me for awhile. Maybe there is a term for what I'm trying to ask about, or maybe I have a poor understanding of time value of money and I'm looking at this problem incorrectly.

&#x200B;

I'd love to know if anyone can help? I promise to pay it forward. Thank you for any insight that you can provide!",3,Technically you should divide. Your real return with x% nominal return and y% inflation is [(1+x%) / (1+y%)] - 1. That tends to be pretty close to x% - y% though.,[deleted],"How fast is it hitting that point where interest exceeds your monthly spending? Compounding interest will lead to rapid growth eventually. But it does take several years to get going. If it’s happening really quickly in your calculations, you might have a mistake in your years/months/rates. The first thing I think of is your 7% is an annualized rate and you would need to divide it by 12 to get your monthly rate of return (since you mention monthly deposits). If you are seeing the growth in like the 10 year range, that’s about right (I forget where exactly compounding interest starts to get impressive).

The reason the prevailing advice here is to just invest in index funds that represent the whole market, is because of what you are seeing. Compounding interest, when given enough time, makes a huge difference in how much money you will have."

time,investing,"Anybody have any thoughts/explanations for agency bonds? Interest rate right now is 6.00% for 20 year agency Federal Home Loan Baser Bonds - idea is buy them as interest rates are likely at all time high, a bit confused why agency bonds are higher than corporate bonds though","Pretty much in the title. Currently can get new issue 6.00% 20 year Federal Home Loan Baser bonds roughly.

My understanding is the Federal Home Loan Banks, although private, are essentially a government created network (or at least government sanctioned network) created through the Federal Home Loan Bank Act. They focus on community lending, mainly residential mortgages. Their bonds are considered agency bonds and have a rating of AAA to AA+. During 2008, although they took a financial hit, they were strong enough so as not to require a government bailout. *See* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhlb.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhlb.asp)

With interest rates high and only another 0.25% federal interest rate increase expected as inflation is reacting as expected, current new issues of Federal Home Loan Basers are  6.00% interest rate which are available to retail through most brokers in $1,000 bond increments. 

This seems like a pretty good deal. Buy a 20 year bond at what are likely high interest rates so likely an expectation that interest rates will go down from the 6.00% interest rate bonds currently being issued. Lock in a 6.00% yield. If interest rates go down then the value of the bonds will go up as you buy them 20 years out so a decrease in interest rate will have more of an impact on the bond value. **It seems the only major downside of these bonds is that they are callable, although not util July 2025**.

My contention is that this time is truly different.  Hear me out.

During 2001-2003, while the overall equity markets were down each of the three years, there was still money to be made in commodities, fixed income, and precious metals.

In 2008, which is the worst market of all our lifetimes, one could make money in alternatives, fixed income (especially taxable income), and healthcare.

Even in 1973-74, there was money to be made in T-Bills, T-Bonds, and real estate.

This year has been different. There is money to be made in commodities especially with energy.  The only other sector that has been profitable is agriculture.  What seems to make this different, is that the more traditional hedges against down markets such as fixed income and precious metals have been losers too. The last time we had a market that was down over -20% and the treasury bond index was negative was in 1931. It appears we are in new territory for many of us, including professionals.

stock market crash,investing,The paradox that the stock market on average will return 8% to 10% but will not return 8% to 10% on average.,"So I haven't been on this subreddit long, but but a common theme I have seen is people doing stuff like saving to buy a house in 3-5 years and wondering if they should put their down payment into the S&P during those 3-5 years so they can get 8% to 10% interest.

Four!

This is one of those counter intuitive things about stats. Kind of like how if a medical test is 99% accurate and your test is positive that does not mean you have a 99% chance of having the condition. Or like how it can be the case that for women medicine A is better than medicine B and for men medicine A is better than medicine B but together for the population as a whole medicine B is better than medicine A. Its just ""common sense"" that if an average is 8% to 10% then that should mean that 8% to 10% is the most common happening. But it does not work that way.

I know I am shouting into the void here. No matter what I say or do it is not going to stop the flow of people thinking that the S&P is a sure bet to return 8% to 10%.

For investors worried about how the election will impact their portfolios over the long haul, fear not: Elections have seldom had a lasting impact on equity prices.

President Donald Trump has warned that the stock market will crash if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the [presidential election](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/election-2020-live-results-updates-trump-biden.html). Some market experts have also raised concern about the potential for a “blue wave” if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate, win the White House and keep control of the House.

However, history shows that stocks usually do well regardless of which party controls the White House or Congress. 

“I think people overestimate the importance of politics for investing,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 

### Are Republicans or Democrats better for stocks? 

Data over the past 78 years shows that party control over either chamber has relatively little to do with long-term changes in the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Starting in 1942, the numbers indicate that Republican and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate have had little impact on stock prices in the two years following an election. 

The same holds true when you look at the number of party seats gained or lost in the House and Senate, against stock prices in the S&P 500 during that period. 

The data yields similar results for the November to November cycle, which is a gauge of market sentiment to the election, as well as January to January, which shows the actual market performance of the Congress. 

### Presidents and stocks 

Where you start to see more of an impact is the combination of party control in both chambers of Congress. 

Data compiled by LPL Financial shows that beginning in 1950, the average annual stock return was 17.2% under a split Congress, 13.4% when Republicans held both chambers, and 10.7% when Democrats had control.

LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick said in a note that “markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn’t have too much sway,” hence the stronger stock performance during a split Congress.

But when you broaden it out even further to consider the party of the president in tandem with party control of the two chambers, the trend of a split Congress being best for stocks doesn’t always hold true. 

Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, looked at how the market has performed under six political scenarios: a White House and Congress all under the same party, a White House with a split Congress, and a White House and Congress hailing from two different parties. Stovall included election data going back to 1945.

Of all the possible combinations, stocks appear to perform best when a Democrat is in the White House and the Congress is split. The second highest returns happen when a Democrat is president and Republicans control the Congress.

 

But ultimately, Stovall said, investors should be wary of reading too much into these numbers. 

“It’s a good example of how you can have data tell whatever story you want,” he said. “If you want to favor the Democrats, talk about the presidency. If you want to favor the Republicans, talk about House control.“  


Bob French, director of investment analysis at McLean Asset Management, agrees. “We can go in and slice and dice the data however we want and most of the time come up with whatever answer we want.”

However the vote plays out Tuesday, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee thinks the stock market is poised to take off.

“At least 90% of \[our\] portfolio strategy would be identical under either win,” Lee said in a note on Oct. 6. In either case, Lee predicts the outcome of the election will be bullish for stocks.",2857,"**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

stock market crash,investing,The reason why the stock market ALWAYS is over valued.,"I know that to figure out whether the broad market is over valued is GDP to the diff indexs. Wilshire 5000, Sp500 etc.  When you do that, the market ALWAYS seems too high.  I'm guessing its because people today don't know what the hell to do w their EXTRA $$$.  They can buy a second house, they can buy bonds but really, other than the stock market, that's about it.

  Once Mutual funds came out IN THE 80'S  (which of course IS the stock market.) boomers and gen xers have been chucking their $$$ into that.  Teens today speculate on their phones with Robinhood with little fear of losing $$$  Nobody really seems afraid to invest in the market.

My grandpa (92) and his friends are/were TERRIFIED of the stock market. Nobody older than the baby boomers would put their $$$ anywhere near that thing. They were even a bit afraid of banks.   They would buy real estate or even freezers full of fish and drums of heating oil, cans of food but never stocks.  I'm guessing this is why the stock market valuations blew up more than anything else in the last 40 years. People now have less fear of the markets and they need SOMEWHERE to invest. 

What do you think???",44,"about 60% of U.S. adults invest in stocks according to various websites. and i highly doubt most of those investors are dumping in a good chunk of their paycheck considering how many love to spend.

But I think that the cycle will repeat itself eventually. High valuations -> lower returns and higher risk of multiple compression -> jaded stock market investors -> higher risk aversion and then lower valuations as money flows out of stocks. The lower valuations will lead to higher returns and happier investors.

Only problem is... what is the time scale of this cycle? Waiting it out might not be a reasonable option (at this point in time)."
stock market crash,investing,Why is simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing the last 3 decades of stock market data to find the best DCA strategy,"By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that

>Time in the market beats timing the market

But what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.

**Theoretically, there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hard-earned money once a month into SPY, right?**

So in this week’s analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!

___ 

**Analysis**

Given that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price & Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years \[1\].

Now we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)

**Average Joe:** Invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending (this would be our benchmark)

**Cautious Charlie:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio \[2\] is lesser than the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold Treasury-Bills \[3\]

**Balanced Barry:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio is within +20% \[4\] of the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold T-Bills

**Analyst Alan:** Invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last all-time high, else will hold T-Bills \[5\].

Given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it’s below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY. 

___

**Results**

Based on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.

**Return Comparison - Different DCA Strategies** 

|**Investment Strategy**|**Portfolio** |**Investment Strategy**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Joe|$169,036|406%|
|Analyst Alan - 1% drop|$168,129|403%|
|Analyst Alan - 3% drop|$166,658|399%|
|Balanced Barry|$162,150|385%|
|Analyst Alan - 5% drop|$154,441|362%|
|Analyst Alan - 10% drop|$146,392|388%|
|Cautious Charlie|$139,696|318%|

 

No matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high.

The least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.

___

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to the analysis.

a. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns

b. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute).

c. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years’ worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.

___ 

**Conclusion**

I started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames \[5,10, 20 years\] and various endpoints \[Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.\]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns.

Since this is an optimization problem, I am [sharing all the data and my analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JK4b-CYgvlSH-FqYvCBEve0RQ3ACmJNsmTwzLV7jqWs/edit?usp=sharing) in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive risk-adjusted market-beating returns.

___ 

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years.

\[2\] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis.

\[3\] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds

\[4\] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends

\[5\] The idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from JP Morgan which stated that 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones",729,"A key takeaway: While some strategy \*may\* be superior to the Average Joe in certain conditions, anyone who is just starting out should be primarily concerned about simply getting in to the market.

stock market crash,investing,Are you mentally prepared for a stock market crash?,"Hi all, new to investing. 

I'm just trying to figure out how people approach investing.
Looking at past market crashes 2002, 2008 (though not frequent) and small recessions since then, are you mentally prepared to lose a significant portion of your current investments should such a crash occur?

I know people generally advise to keep emergency funds (like 6m of expenses) and to invest the remaining cash in index ETFs. But are you really mentally prepared to, in worst cases, lose even 50%-60% of everything besides that 6m of emergency funds? 

Maybe I'm more risk adverse than the average investor but the daunting thought would make me only want to invest like 40% (or even less) of my possessions in the stock market and keeping way more cash than 6m emergency funds.

What are your thoughts?

Schwab money market funds are pretty safe. I have my Schwab cash in SWVXX.","Typically even if a brokerage account paid interest it's based on the ""cash sweep"" function and at Schwab that's extremely low. So for conversation sake you can just say it pays nearly nothing as is for cash.

I really like buying 20 year treasuries. They yield about ~4.5% and would essentially act as the equivalent of locked"" for the 20 years at that rate. Rates aren't going to stay high forever so locking long duration now is a great strategy in my opinion. Also the 20 year yields higher than the 30 year right now, yeah it's kind of what it is in this current market.

You can do this through Schwab by using the ""Trade->Bonds"" area on the website.

I like this better than short duration and general funds because those will drop in the coming years. So even if you can get 5.5% in short duration now it probably will lose out to locking at 4.5% now in about 3 years time is my guess.","Inherited IRA works just like a normal IRA -- you buy and sell what you want. Any interest, gains and losses aren't taxed as long as they sit in the account. When you withdraw anything (move it to another account) it all gets taxed as income at that time. So moving it to a HYSA would be a taxable event. I'd suggest mostly investing in index funds (VTI, etc), T-bills, and CDs.  


Remember that you \*may\* have to pull out some as a Required Minimum Dispersal (RMD). This years may have been done before it transferred, but you're responsible to know that. And you're probably required to pull it all out before 10 years is done.  


I recently figured all this out inheriting from my father. In my case, I'm working a full time job, so I'm pulling out the bare minimum required until I retire so that I don't get taxed very much on it. Upon retirement my income will be significantly less, so I can pull out with lower taxes. IMHO, taxes are never the most important consideration, but they're always worth considering."

These two last posts (4a and [4b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hu8uh9/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_last_post_part/)) conclude my introduction related to options. I will show some of my key trades, explaining the why, the how, the entries and exits, and potential mitigations in case of losses. Most gave great returns, and I had a few small losses. Overall, in the past few months, I have been lucky to play along with the market, and the high volatility had a positive impact. Hopefully, nothing r/wsb worthy (although few of them might qualify :)). I wanted to explain the basics first, then show the trades last, as I did not want anyone to try to emulate these without understanding how/why they worked.

First, here are the high-level idioms that drive my investments:

* Over time, the market is going up.
* It can fall down violently, or it can jump high without obvious signs ahead of time.
* When the market goes down, it will go back up over time, and that can be very quick.
* A single stock will be more volatile than the markets and can go up or down even more violently. And unlike the market, if it goes down, there is no guarantee it will ever go back up.
* After a significant market move, the market often, but not always, reverts to the mean.

These idioms are pretty straightforward, and should not be too controversial. Overall, I am pretty market neutral, with a bullish tint.  And as I explained before, I prefer selling options than buying them. My trades reflect that, and I avoid making trades that could damage my portfolio significantly if the market went up or down significantly. People who get ruined with options do not take this into account and are just gambling.

Other key things about trading in general, and options in particular:

* Always have a clear idea of your max profit and your max loss, and the probability of that to happen. Failing to understand this means that you will take more risk than anticipated, and one day you could blow up your account and get ruined.
* Keep your trades small, don’t have a “sure thing” trade that risks 10% or more of your portfolio. Don’t cripple your portfolio because of one bad trade.
* Don’t trade for the sake of trading, wait for the conditions to be right, then wait a bit more, and wait again, then when things look the best, then trade on your own terms. Do not get sucked into gambling with a poor profit/risk profile.
* Watch out for your leverage, it can be very easy to take too many risks, and use too much of your buying power. If you mix your bearish and bullish bets, you can close one side at a profit to free some buying power and reduce overall risk.

Now the moment we have been waiting for, some of my trades:

**The short naked puts or covered calls:**

I only do pure covered calls when the market has dropped significantly, and use the recent market conditions as a floor. March dropped quite hard, and I am not convinced that we would reach it again soon, but I still have to prepare for it. That being said, the months of March to June have been really good for covered calls as the market traded up first, then sideways, with high implied volatility. I usually target shares that are solid or did not go up too much, so the March floor is not too far lower than my strike. I usually sell naked puts after a few down days in a row and covered calls after a few up days in a row. And if the market is farther from the floor, I trade safer names when the market goes up, and target high beta when the market dropped significantly.

I am not giving you a full list, but let’s say that it was not hard, and still is, to find good names that return 1-2% per month AFTER accounting for a 15-25% share drop. Yup, you read that right, it does not work in normal markets, but it is the case right now. Even if **$WM, $WMT, $INTC, $NNN, $EWW, $DLTR, $COF, $BAC,** etc. dropped by around 20%, I would gladly pocket my 1-2% premium, and scoop these at a huge discount. Even if it dropped further, I can continue rolling the puts until the market bounces back. Some of the high beta names include **$CCL, $REM, $DIG, $BUD, $JETS, $XOP**, etc. For a high beta, I am targeting 3-5-10% or more of premium, but I usually try to offload them when they go up significantly.

But there are few other riskier trades that are worth calling out:

**$DKNG - DraftKing: 11.8% in \~3 weeks.**

I forgot about the IPO, and got in the game 5 days later. Although, I am not a gambler, and the stock went up already, but I had a feeling that RH fams would jump on it (gamblers beget gamblers), and that would give a floor to the stock. Volatility was high, so selling naked PUTs made sense.

May 7: SELL -1 DKNG 100 15 MAY 20 22.5 PUT @ 1.06

Per contract - Max risk: $2144 - Max profit: $106 (4.9% of max risk)

May 8: SELL -1 DKNG 100 19 JUN 20 22.5 PUT @ 2.15

Per contract - Max risk: $2035 - Max profit: $215 (10.5% of max risk)

As you know the max risk of going to $0 is possible but highly improbable, so RORAC (Return on Risk-Adjusted Capital) is much higher than these 4.9 to 10.5%.

The $1.06 premium was one week before expiration! I sold the MAY and JUNE PUTs at the same time. And the price was at $24 already. If the price dropped, I would continue rolling my PUTs until I am profitable. The price went up, I rolled my MAY PUTs just before earnings (and a day before expiration), to take advantage of the earning volatility, and avoiding expiration day.

May 14: SELL -1 DKNG 100 15 MAY 20/19 JUNE 20 22.5 PUT @ 2.15

Per contract - Max risk: $2035 - Max profit: $215 (10.5% of max risk)

So one week later, I bought back my MAY PUTs for $0.25 (pocketing already 3.7% of the profit) and sold the same JUNE contract as the week before with a better price and an overall premium of $2.15 (same as the week before, despite paying back the $0.25! And the stock was already up in a week. Can you believe that shit? Volatility increase definitely helped. Thanks RH gamblers!).

June 1: BUY +1 DKNG 100 19 JUNE 20 22.5 PUT @ 0.05

After a bit more than 3 weeks of holding, I decided to buy back all my contracts for $0.05 per share, for an overall 11.8% profit on risk. I pretty much reached max profit already, no need to take more risk, with 19 days to go to expiration. FWIW the stock was at $44 by expiration. It was way too much for my taste, with no premium worth the risk of any new trade.

Could I have made more profit buying shares, calls, or synthetic shares? Sure. But there was no guarantee on the direction, timing, or amplitude of the move. Here, I won almost 12% with a high probability of success, even if the stock barely budged or dropped a bit. And since 6/19 expiration, the stock dropped to $33 now. It’s hard to predict when to sell. I want many singles and doubles with few losses, instead of once in a while home runs with many losses in between.

As it dropped for 5 days to $33, I recently sold some PUTs for a $22.5 strike again:

June 29: SELL -1 DKNG 100 21 AUG 20 22.5 PUT @ 1.25

Per contract - Max risk: $2125, max profit: $125 (5.8% of max risk)

Because the PUT was deep OTM, the premium was low. The stock will have to drop by more than 35% for me to start losing money, and I can still roll my PUTs then. That seems a good trade. Wish me luck!

You can see here, that you have to look at your max risk, your max profit for every trade you are getting into, as well as the chance for them to be profitable.

**$USO / $DBO / $USL: 12% in 2 months**

Here is one that **absolutely did not go to plan** initially, but I was able to turn it around.

First, the trade that led to the disaster:

April 17: SELL -1 MAY 15 20 4 PUT @ 0.35

Per contract - Max risk: $365 - Max profit: $35 (9.5% of max risk)

Remember that USO split 1:8 on April 29, if you want to look at the numbers. On 4/17, USO was worth $4.20. Oil kept dropping and dropping for weeks and weeks, until that Friday where I decided that it was finally a good time to get into oil (like a bunch of other suckers). The lowest oil price in 40 years, etc. My trade could absorb a 14% loss in USO before I started losing money, so it did not feel too risky, and I could roll the PUTs if needed. USO rolled all their future contracts earlier that week, they were already into May Futures. Yeah, contango was a concern but seemed manageable (or so I thought).

Well, except that on Monday 4/20, oil blew up. What was bad, became an awful day. Oil tanked hard because April futures dropped, and some people paid to get rid of their contracts. Tankers started to get full, too much oil, and not enough space. USO dropped to 3.75, it was still above my break-even point of $3.65, but the volatility spiked, so the value of my short put increased a lot, that was some heavy losses. Why did I go into that trade on Friday, gosh?!?

The volatility was so high, every oil trader was running around like a headless chicken, RH gamblers were taking much heavier losses than mine (because they started buying USO long before me, oil was going to go back up, that was a sure deal! Right?). I decided to wait one more day, to see how the dust would settle. On Tuesday, USO dropped even more because now it started impacting next Month's Future (May). Tuesday was the April Future expiration, so trading was all over the place. USO dropped to $3, well below my break-even point, volatility was still high, my losses were twice as big. There was a strong possibility that May Future expiration would behave the same as April, and the rollover of May Futures to June Futures would end up in a real quagmire due to an even higher contango. USO was not the right tool, I messed up, no way moving forward, even rolling my PUTs are not going to do it, USO will drop faster than the premium I can collect. Get out, get out, get out...

April 21: BUY +1 MAY 15 20 4 PUT @ 1.42

I bought back my short PUT at more than 4 times the premium price. Gulp. That hurts.

Taking a step back, this was an extreme situation and not a normal loss with a stupid long term thesis. And I lost a bit of money jumping at the wrong time. A negative future price is not a common occurrence.

USO was the wrong instrument to profit from oil, it even dropped down to $2.11. And never recovered its value from 4/17 despite oil being higher than that day. I made a mistake, but there must be better instruments that can tackle contango. Enters DBO and USL. DBO has a 6-12 month away contract, so very little impact from contango. USL has the same number of contracts from all months (next month, month after next, etc..., until the 12th month). It is mostly impacted by the contango on the front months (so for 1/12 of the value, or a bit more), but it is not as volatile as USO (USO since changed their composition too, to buy multiple months futures).

Oil blew up, volatility is extremely high, many oil traders (and RH gamblers) got ruined, but oil is bound to go up eventually. The initial trade to sell volatility through selling naked puts, and rolling as needed until oil goes back up, without being killed by the contango still seemed sound with even less risk and better rewards this time around.

April 20: SELL -1 DBO MAY 15 20 6 PUT @ 0.63

Per contract - Max risk: $537 - Max profit: $63 (11.7% of max risk)

April 20: SELL -1 USL MAY 15 20 12 PUT @ 1.05

Per contract - Max risk: $1095 - Max profit: $105 (9.5% of max risk)

April 21: SELL -1 DBO MAY 15 20 5 PUT @ 0.90

Per contract - Max risk: $410 - Max profit: $90 (21.9% of max risk)

April 21: SELL -1 USL MAY 15 20 11 PUT @ 2.25

Per contract - Max risk: $875 - Max profit: $225 (25.7% of max risk)

Notice that I sold the first batch on April 20, as I was still losing money from USO. The volatility spiked, and it was too good to pass. This is a key reason why you should never put all your money on one trade, but only a few percents at most. That way if the things are not going as planned, you don’t lose a ton, and if you can find a more advantageous position, you can double down if you have some dry powder left (but DO NOT overdo it!). It’s all about the proper sizing of trades and overall risk. I sold the 2nd batch when I closed my losing USO trade when oil dropped further and volatility increased even more! 22% to 26% potential profit on ATM puts? Just wow!

The plan for the exit is to close for $0.05 or roll to the next month for further profit. I sized my DBO and USL trades a bit more than my USO trades, so I would make up for the heavy losses. And I did roll in May and closed the June contracts for $0.05 both DBO and USL. Their prices both creeped up slowly, and the volatility dropped to something normal. DBO and USL trades were extremely profitable, and despite the heavy USO losses, the overall profit was still quite good.

Today, the price of DBO and USL is a bit high for a good profit/risk profile with naked short PUTs, however, we have some other strategies.

**The verticals:**

Most of my bread and butter is on selling naked puts, and/or selling covered calls, but sometimes I dabble in verticals. Here are some examples:

**$UBER: 13.2% in a month**

This is an example of waiting for the right time before you trade. End of May, the market went up by 36% since the bottom, it started to be over-extended. Although SPY could continue higher, it was time to think about a reversion to the mean. I needed to find a share that would continue to struggle for a long time, even as Coronavirus was lingering. I hear the news that LYFT is taking over UBER’s market and that UBER is still struggling, with potential layoffs. That seems a good candidate, and UBER has a good day at $36, let’s see what we can make of the numbers.

May 29: SELL -1 UBER JUL 17 20 42/45 CALL @ 0.40

Per contract - Max risk: $260 - Max profit: $40 (15.3% of max risk)

So I keep my $40 profit per contract as long as UBER is under $42 at the July 17 expiration. I did not pick $42 randomly, this was actually above the top that UBER reached in February. So the struggling UBER would need to go over its pre-corona numbers for me to lose money. Unlike naked puts / covered calls, where you can just be patient and roll over and over, sizing for verticals is important, the potential for full losses is a real possibility, and will happen. Sure, you could try to roll your short call and hope that the stock price will drop, but you may just end up amplifying your losses. If you really want to do that and continue with the risk, it’s easier to roll your short puts in a bull spread as the market will eventually go up.

In any case, UBER continued to go up a bit, struggled at $38 (so not even close to my vertical), then reversed. I put an order to close my position at $0.05, as there was almost a month left until expiration, and I already almost reached my max profit.

June 22: BUY +1 UBER JUL 17 20 42/45 CALL @ 0.05

**$SPY: Various**

I also have been using SPY verticals directly as the market bounced back like crazy. I earned more than I lost, and because I am overall positive delta, even if I lose a bit of money on my edges, I am still very profitable.

For shit and giggles, one trade to show how you can take advantage of the high volatility:

June 5: SELL -1 SPY JUL 17 20 330/333 CALL @ 0.91

Per contract - Max risk: $209 - Max profit: $91 (43.5% of max risk)

June 26: BUY +1 SPY JUL 17 20 330/333 CALL @ 0.08

Profit of $83 per contract (39.7% of max risk)

June 5, SPY was $320, 45% higher than the bottom 2½ months ago, and I had hard time believing that after the market really thought that SPY would go back to pre-corona level with still phase 1 not over, no clear treatment, vaccine many months away, and potential for a 2nd wave (News flash: It’s happening before even the phase1 finished). Trees don’t grow to the sky. Again being, overall positive delta, even if this vertical had a loss, I would still profit from SPY going over my short calls. As I said earlier, I am a reversion to the mean guy, with a bullish tint. I can’t stand losing money when the market is going up (because the market could always continue going back up).

Here is another trade, not so good this time, so I don’t paint an overly rosy picture:

May 12: SELL -1 SPY JUN 19 20 305/308 CALL @ 0.79

Per contract - Max risk: $221 - Max profit: $79 (35.7% of max risk)

June 18: BUY +1 SPY JUN 19 20 305/308 CALL @ 2.48

Ouch - loss of $169 per contract (76.4% of max risk)

SPY blew way past my short and long calls. It dropped a bit before expiration, so I was able to avoid a full loss.

My verticals above are bearish spreads when I think the market will revert to the mean. But here is an example of a bullish spread:

April 6: SELL -1 SPY DEC 16 22 200/180 CALL @ 4.85

Per contract - Max risk: $1515 - Max profit: $485 (32% of max risk)

May 12: BUY +1 SPY DEC 16 22 200/180 CALL @ 3.95

Profit of $90 per contract (5.9% of max risk)

I sold the vertical a couple of weeks after the bottom, with blood in the street, even some of mine, volatility was still very high. With this trade, I would have lost money if SPY was less than $195 in more than 2 years. Heh, I could even roll the puts if the short put was still ITM in 2 years. The only reason I bought back and closed the trade was that it was using a non-negligible buying power for the next 2 years. That is a long time to earn the full $485 per contract. Have to watch out for opportunity costs too in some other trades.

**The hedge:**

Here is another construct that I found interesting. Again, taking advantage of the current high volatility. Back in early June, as the market bounced to $320, I wanted another bearish hedge, but this time more efficient than just selling a vertical. I wanted a good protection for my long delta, but that’s not free. And I don’t like to lose money if the hedge is not used, so what to do?

June 5: SELL -1 SPY NOV 20 20 370/380 CALL @ 0.57

Per contract - Max risk: $943 - Max profit: $57 (6% of max risk)

I picked November expiration because I expect that we will still be in the middle of the Coronavirus quagmire. $370 is almost 9% higher than the SPY top. I doubt that the economy will be back full speed by then. Again, I am positive delta, so if SPY somehow reaches $370, I may have to forgo all my overall gains between $370 and $380, but I won’t lose money overall. And then I bought this bearish vertical:

June 5: BUY +1 SPY NOV 20 20 245/250 PUT @ 0.57

Per contract - Max risk: $57 - Max profit: $443 (777% of max risk)

Here, I used the money from my short bearish CALL spread to buy a long bearish PUT spread. As long as SPY does not end above $370 by expiration, my hedge is free. If the market drops significantly my bearish PUT spread will be very profitable.

Once again, it's a long post, so that's all for today.

In the second [part](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hu8uh9/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_last_post_part/) of this post, I will show how I used calendars to make some very profitable trades.

I will also explain a more advanced trade that I used to hedge against big losses in a normal market (setup in low volatility), so you can handle more gracefully bear markets ahead of time, and not sell in panic. You can’t use it now, but it could be helpful next time everything is great, and the market is getting overheated a bit.

&#x200B;

And finally, remember to always size your trades properly. Do not let one trade create a big loss in your portfolio. Do not overextend! It's way too easy to be over-leveraged with options, take the full risk into consideration.

I wanted to chat a bit about options here. I realize that there are already plenty of articles about options that you can find online, but many are either overly complex, oversimplified, trying to sell you some products, etc. I figured I would explain some of it here, in order to reduce the learning barrier. After all, knowledge is power. And given the **recent** [event](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/young-robinhood-trader-kills-himself-over-730000-loss) **with Robinhood**, I figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood, and don’t end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later. If you are interested in trading options, I invite you to look for more details online.

I have been trading options since 2008. I made some mistakes, so many, especially in the beginning. Over the years, I kinda reduced my option trading activities, but these past few months, I have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile, which helps with my trading style.

This **first** post is to explain how options work in general, the [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/) post will go into some more details, the third posts [3a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgomwv/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3a_of_4/) and [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/) will explain some standard strategies, and the fourth posts ([4a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hlb9ns/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_4a_of_4/) and [4b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hu8uh9/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_last_post_part/)) will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how I approach option investing. If you are looking at r/wsb style of investment, please skip these posts, they are not for you. I am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles, but I will still take some calculated risks. So I say. :) It is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard ETFs / mutual funds / Real Estate. So, my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth.

It is often perceived that options are extremely risky, and one of the best ways to get ruined. For some trades, this can be true. To dispel a myth, in reality, options can also be used to be extremely conservative. Even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market. Unlike for shares, where you can only control the diversification, with options you have a much bigger control on the risk / profit profile. Time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit (or lose) from.

One thing to note is that not all companies or ETFs provide options for their shares.

**The basics: CALL and PUT contracts, strike, and exercise**

Options are split into two groups: CALLs and PUTs. Both have a strike, an expiration date, and a number of shares attached to it. We’ll talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later. When you buy a call or put option, you buy a contract with a 3rd party through your broker and the stock market. Usually, one contract represents 100 shares.

The strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument. So for SPY that is worth $308 today, you will have options with strike $308, but also $300, $301, $310, etc… From $5 to $525. Options strikes are created as the underlying instrument SPY goes up and down. For SPY, strikes have a granularity of $1 around the share price, but can also be $5 or even $10 farther from the current price. Some other instruments have a $2.5, $5 or even $10 granularity. It can even have a $0.50 granularity. (Hello Hertz! It dropped so much that the lowest strike is $0.50 right now).

A CALL is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you buy a call with a $150 strike, and the share price went up to reach $200, this allows you to buy some shares at $150 that are now worth $200. The action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call. When you exercise your call contract, you are buying shares into your account.

Remember that, in most cases, 1 contract will buy 100 shares in your account. When exercising each call contract, you will need $15k of cash in your account in this example ($150 for the strike, multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $20k (at $200 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the call option (more on this later), this means you will make a profit of $5k if you sell the shares.

Conversely, a PUT is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you bought a put with a $200 strike, and the share price went down to $150, this allows you to sell some shares at $200 that are now worth $150 each. Similarly to a call, the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put.

When exercising each put contract, you are selling 100 shares from your account. When exercising each contract, your 100 shares will be sold for $20k ($200 for the strike multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $15k (at $150 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the put option, this means you made a profit of $5k. If you did not have the 100 shares per contract in your account, you would be actually short selling the shares, and you could make the $5k profit by buying these shares back.

In summary, a call buys shares when exercising. A put sells shares when exercising. Most importantly, in the vast majority of the cases, you should actually not exercise your contracts, but instead, you should sell your call or put at the market price, as you will increase your profit (see extrinsic value later).

Brokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money. In other words, you can’t exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call (you want to buy low when the value is high), or current value is above the strike for a put (you want to sell high when the value is low).

Most brokers do auto-exercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised. If the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date, and you did not sell your contracts before, they will be worthless, and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost.

Although I am mostly talking about American style options that can be exercised at any time, there are also European style options that can only be exercised at expiration. In the US markets, pretty much all stocks and ETFs are American style, But the cash-settled indexes, like SPX and RUT, are European style.

**The basics: Intrinsic and extrinsic value**

A call or a put contract costs money to buy, called a premium, so a 3rd party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put. After all, they won’t take the other side of this contract for free, and they have to be remunerated. The minimum for a contract is $0.01 per share for some very liquid ETFs, but for most instruments, it is $0.05, thus $5 per contract for 100 shares. When you buy a call or put, this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date. The 3rd party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses (see below).

The value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike, on the share price going up and down, the share’s volatility (how fast / far it goes up or down), and the time passing.

When you buy a contract, the strike and the expiration date is known. However, the share price and volatility will constantly change. All the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing (closer to the expiration date).

The intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price. It is above $0 only when you can exercise the contract. The extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time. For pretty much all options, this extrinsic value is above $0, and will slowly drop to $0 as we get closer to the expiration.

Let’s take an example with a share price of $150.

Say, you buy a call with a strike of $145 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($150 - $145), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5). Said differently, if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date, your call contract would bring you $5 per share. You would have lost $2 due to the time passing.

Similarly, you buy a put with a strike of $155 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($155 - $150), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5).

It is worth noting that any call with a strike price at $150 or above has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $155 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. If the stock price does not go over $155, you will lose the full $4 per share (so a $400 loss per contract). Similarly, a put with a strike price at $150 or below has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $145 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. Your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under $145.

Note that, in these examples, I use the same price for the call and put options that are $5 away from the strike price, but it’s not always the case. The call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility, market expectations, potential dividends, cost of money, etc.

**The basics: ATM, ITM, and OTM**

There are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls.

An option is ‘At The Money’ (ATM) when the current share value is matching the strike. The share price is $150, and the strike of $150 for both the call and put contracts will be considered ‘at the money’.

An option is ‘In The Money’ (ITM) when the contract has some intrinsic value. The share price is $150, so a call at $140 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value. A put at $160 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value too.

An option is ‘deep in the money’ when the option is ITM and the strike is far from the current share price (for example more than 20%). For example, with a share price of $150, a $100 call will be considered ‘deep in the money’. Same for a $200 put.

Conversely, an option is ‘out of the money’ if there is no intrinsic value. With a $150 share price, a $160 call is ‘out of the money’. A $140 put is ‘out of the money’. The money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value, there is no intrinsic value. An option is ‘deep out of the money’ when the option is OTM and the strike is far from the current share price. For example, with a share price of $150, a $200 call will be considered ‘deep out of the money’. Same for a $100 put.

As the share price goes up and down, depending on the option strikes, it can switch between ITM, to ATM, to OTM. The option price will always reflect that and will be based on the time at expiration and the current share volatility.

Few key things to note:

* The deeper ITM an option is, the more expensive it is. As it gets deeper ITM, the intrinsic value increases, the extrinsic value decreases. You have a higher chance for the option to be worth something, and you will lose less money on the extrinsic value. The price of Deep ITM options will move very closely to the underlying shares (a positive correlation for calls, a negative correlation for puts).
* The deeper OTM an option is, the less expensive it is. Again, OTM option price is pure extrinsic value. You have a very small chance for the option to be worth something by expiration.
* The maximum extrinsic value is when the option is ATM. It is purely extrinsic value, with barely any intrinsic value. These option strikes are the most sensitive to time, volatility and share price.

Here is an example, with the same share price of $150. For a call, you could get something like this:

Strike = $100 / Premium = $53 / Intrinsic = $50 / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep ITM

Strike = $125 / Premium = $30 / Intrinsic = $25 / Extrinsic = $5 ← ITM

Strike = $150 / Premium = $9   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $9 ← ATM

Strike = $175 / Premium = $5   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $5 ← OTM

Strike = $200 / Premium = $3   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep OTM

You can imagine the same table for a put but in the other direction.

It is worth noting that if you have a $100 call and you decide to exercise it, you would directly get $50 of proceeds per share, but you would also destroy the extrinsic value to $0, losing $3 of proceeds. Instead of exercising your call, you are much better off selling your call for $53. In general, there are not many reasons to exercise your options. Selling them is more advantageous.

Powell also indicated **Fed will keep rates high in the longterm** to counter speculation Fed would start cutting in 2023.

market,investing,Gamestop Big Picture: Market Mechanics,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* 

Rather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.

There was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.

# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price

Ok, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.

[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)

As you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.

On the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.

The lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.

I find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!

Since company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.

So, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.

So simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).

# Market Games

So, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).

Then you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.

Imagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.

That's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.

# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics

In a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.

With a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.

In my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.

My guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a <$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.

Say what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.

Remember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.

How about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.

The above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.

Let's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.

That being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.

If you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.

That is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?

That, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).

Another thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.

Ok, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.

A couple of final points:

* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.
* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.
* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:

&#8203;

    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;
    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;
    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;
    
    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);
    
    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;
    
    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);
    
    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);
    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);

Also, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.

2000/2010s, 9/11 , war on terror , Iraq war, Great financial crisis

2020- COVID , Ukraine war ect...

There 100% is always uncertainty and some have sort of argued that in the late 1990s was sort of a anomaly and if you were a cautions investor maybe for the fist time in 100 years you looked around and found nothing hugely concerning soviet union fell,  Iraq war was won ect.

But then looked what happened the stock market went into a HUGE bubble and took like 12 years to recover , so just looking at past history when every thing is ""good"" might not be the best time to invest as its probably going to be a MASSIVE BUBBLE

So in the past 100 years or so, maybe in the 1920s/late 1990s things looked good but massive bubbles also formed; so maybe the best time to invest is not when everything looks good, everything will be over priced .","Yes. The market is always uncertain. Nothing is ever different.

price,investing,A Deep Dive into Nikola's FCEV Design and Price Model,"Hey everyone.  I'm a mechanical engineering student with a hobby interest in finance.  I've spent the last few days figuring out if Nikola's leasing model is actually possible.  There's some really wacky stuff going on in Nikola's presentations and financial projections, and I wanted to share my findings.

&#x200B;

This is an absolute wall of words, and I wouldn't be offended if you didn't want to read it all.  In the first half, I try to tease out the cost per mile of an actual Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) given the specification Nikola lists.   Next there is a portion where I look at the discrepancies between their Financial Projections and their Lease breakdown.   Then a quick little peanut gallery where I look at their unrealistic assumptions and the hypocrisy of their comparisons.  Finally, a more serious portion where I discuss the design, efficiency, and utility implications of Nikola's chosen power output and battery capacity.  Hope you guys enjoy!

&#x200B;

Let's get started:

Nikola claims that they have the industry first holistic leasing program, including maintenance, fuel, and use of the vehicle. They plan on leasing for $.95 per mile @ 30% margin.  This implies an expense of ~~$.73~~ $.67 per mile to Nikola.

**Hydrogen costs:**

According to the DoE, it currently costs $5.10/kg to produce, compress, and dispense hydrogen.  Nikola claims they can do this for $2.47/kg.  I highly doubt their estimate, and will elaborate on that later.  Hydrogen has a specific energy 33.3 kWh/kg.  A Fuel cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) has an average thermal efficiency of 55%.  A diesel semi tractor, which easily compares to Nikola’s offerings, consumes about 1.25 kWh of work per km (or 2.125 per mile) of useful work loaded.

This implies the Nikola truck will use 3.86 kWh of hydrogen per mile, at a cost of $0.59 per mile, or $.29 using their estimates.  The DoE estimate could be pretty rosy as well, Hindenburg cited a practical price of $16 per kg for hydrogen in their report.  Nikola’s estimate in the leasing breakdown is 7.5 miles per kg of hydrogen @ $2.47 per kg.  That works out to $.33/mile.  Our estimates are pretty close, excluding hydrogen costs.  It looks like, in a surprising twist, they actually overestimated the energy consumption of a tractor.  Or maybe not.  We’ll get to that

ICCT Tractor-Trailer Fuel Consumption:  [https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EU\_HDV\_Testing\_BriefingPaper\_20180515a.pdf](https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EU_HDV_Testing_BriefingPaper_20180515a.pdf)

Why do I doubt their hydrogen cost estimates?  $2.5 per kg implies $.075 per kWh of hydrogen produced  The average price for Industrial electricity in Arizona, the state they are headquartered in, was $.068/kWh, some of the cheapest in the US.  Of course, there isn’t a 1:1 conversion of electricity to hydrogen: an electrolyzer uses about 50 kWh per kg of hydrogen ( specific energy of 33.3kWh/kg), making the electricity expense alone in excess of $.10 per kWh of hydrogen.  Electricity must also be used to compress the hydrogen.  This would take another \~4 kWh, though we’re already over budget.  God forbid they use California electricity at an average cost of $.15 per kWh.  The electricity expense for the Electrolyzers alone exceeds their estimates, much less depreciation expense, cost of capital, maintenance expense, salary expense, etc.  Clearly a bogus number.

I suppose they can use renewable excess during off-hours for cheap, but the rapidly decreasing costs of energy storage will likely level out those low prices rather quickly.  This also only works in Arizona and a select few other states; California not included.  There is the issue of a startup paying to build huge electrolyzers that might have a utilization factor of \~30%, and additional high pressure storage will be needed.  The abhorrent upfront capex needed to try and drive down operating costs is not viable for them.

NREL H2 cost analysis from 2011.  This is just about the most recent research I can find.  The abject lack of new material tells me it’s not exactly a hoppin’ field:  [https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/production-cost-analysis.html#fn3](https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/production-cost-analysis.html#fn3)

**Fuel Cell costs:**

Part of the reason there are currently so few FCVs on the road today is the limited service life of a fuel cell.  Fuel cells are precision manufactured components that degrade quickly when jostled & vibrated too violently.  This is not good when combined with the rock-hard suspensions of semi tractors.

The DoE targets a useful life of 150,000 miles for a fuel cell.  Currently, there is no information confirming this target has been met.  A Toyota Murai comes with a 100,000 mile warranty on its FC.  For the sake of argument, I will assume Nikola FCs can meet this target.  The DoE targets a cost of $40/kW for fuel cell production in 2020, provided mass hits 500,000.  This hasn’t happened yet, but I will again assume this to give Nikola the best chance.  As an aside:  Nikola’s decision to use exclusively GM FC technology in their Badger pickup indicates to me they have nothing “up their sleeve” to make the technology more viable, despite my optimistic assumptions.

I’ll assume the Nikola Two’s Fuel cell is 500 kW, less than the 750 kW claimed output.  I think it  likely their horsepower claim will be a peak power figure only achievable when the motors draw on the battery & FC.  I cannot confirm this, because Nikola does not list the output of their motors and FC separately (along with myriad other questionable, or lack of, claims).  I think this is reasonable, considering FC thermal efficiency is maximized between 20% and 30% load, and a semi will average \~90 kW of useful work required on the highway, translating to \~170 kW of FC usage.  This is near the peak efficiency band of a PEMFC.  This assumption also allows steady-state operation at 66% of the “rated” output.  This implies an upfront cost of $20,000.  A targeted useful life of 150,000 miles implies a depreciation expense of $.13 per mile.

NREL Stack Durability and Performance vs load chart:  [https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73011.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73011.pdf)

**Battery costs:**

Using BNEF 2023 battery cost estimates of $100/kWh, that equates to $25,000 of battery expense.  Assuming a useful life of .25M miles, more than any existing warranty currently covers, that results in a depreciation expense of $.125 per mile.

**Chassis and the rest:**

Lastly, I extrapolated an FCEV COGS of $175,000 per truck from their Financial projections, minus the $45,000 of equipment already listed, and a 15% scrap value I pulled out of my ass to try and help nikola here, leaves $104,000 depreciated over 700k miles, or a $.15 depreciation expense per mile.

**Maintenance costs:**

Nikola assumed a $.061/mile maintenance cost.  Any engineer should be able to see such a claim and immediately question it.  Tires alone should account for $.03 per mile.  That leaves…. $.031 for brakes, air lines, HVAC, wiring, electrical equipment, motors, inverters, those battery and FC expenses I already calculated, sensors, etc.  They make no additional provisions for the battery/FC in their leasing breakdown.  Pure, unadulterated bullshit.   The ICCT puts BEV per mile maintenance at \~$.19/mile.  How they squeezed 70% of those costs out, as an unproven startup, by going for a more complex FC-BEV hybrid is beyond me.

Cost of trucking:  [https://www.thetruckersreport.com/infographics/cost-of-trucking/](https://www.thetruckersreport.com/infographics/cost-of-trucking/)

Nikola Leasing cost breakdown, p19:  [https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation\_file/5/NikolaInvestorRoadShowPresentation042720.pdf](https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation_file/5/NikolaInvestorRoadShowPresentation042720.pdf)

**Leasing Conclusions:**

Adding their laughably low per mile maintenance expense of .061 + .15 + .125 + .13 +.59  gives us an aggregate $1.06 per mile expense for Nikola.  Using their fuel expense estimate of $.29, this equates to $.76; still more than their projected gross expenses.  The first estimate is 50% over they need for their claimed 30% gross margin at $.95 per mile.  Note:  I used a projected battery expense, projected FC service life target, and projected FC production expense.  None of these have been met.  I used the average resitive forces acting on a US tractor-trailer, which appear to be lower than the number Nikola uses.  I did not include warranty expenses in my estimate.  Additionally, these are EXPENSES, and includes 0 profit for the suppliers of these parts.  The GM-Nikola deal clearly shows there will be little vertical integration in their production, and such allowances would have to be made.

A more reasonable estimate, including a still optimistic 3% interest expense for truck capex, a .4% annual warranty expense (corresponding to their presented 3% estimated reserve).  That reserve, btw, is very optimistic:  Tesla used a higher reserve on the S for years, while building a simpler product with a warranty length/distance a literal order of magnitude lower than the Nikola truck.  A \*STILL\* low maintenance expense of $.12, and a 10% margin for battery & FC production, we end up with an **$.92** per mile expense, or more than Nikola can afford, even when using their untenable $2.5 per kg hydrogen estimate.  This is before G&A expenses.  Their leasing business model is not possible.

**Lease Projections v. Income Projections:  Internal Chaos or Outright Fraud?**

It’s possible some of the folks at Nikola have already found those problems out, though.  Nikola says they have plans to Lease their trucks.  They’ve had presentation slides including the idea, and their truck descriptions on their website include a leasing plan.  In their most recent presentation at the DB Global Auto Industry Conference in June, however, the Leasing cost breakdown slide was conspicuously missing.  Their Financial projections slide showed 2,000 FCEV trucks being produced in 2023, and 470 million in revenue from FCEV sales.  This represents $235,000 per truck, and their FCEV revenue scales exactly linearly into their 2024 projected sales; no room for residual from the 2023 trucks.  **They’re projecting to sell them!**  Revenue from maintenance and Hydrogen sales are also listed separately.  Their Financial projections clearly show the upfront sale of trucks with additional Hydrogen fueling and maintenance revenue, and the leasing model slide has disappeared.  It’s easy to see why.  Their projected combined expenses and capex exceeds $7.5 billion through 2024, significantly more than their current $1 Billion in assets and a couple of lease payments would allow for.  This would take some intense share dilution (not something I think Trevor would be on board with) or extremely expensive leverage.

It’s not like they’re going to get cheap loans secured against their proprietary trucks, requiring their proprietary stations, to run only their customers’ preset routes.  A bank wouldn’t want that kind of collateral.  The leasing idea is a real mess.

One can claim that the lease model is still in the description of the trucks, but so are battery and fuel cell specifications for the Nikola one.  The Nikola one was, ostensibly, never actually powered by hydrogen, and development has since been abandoned.  It looks like their leasing Idea may have been abandoned as well.

I’ll also point out that an expected 2024 FCEV maintenance revenue of 56 million on 7000 trucks sold, assuming an average of 50,000 miles per truck sold in 2024 (the average mileage if the trucks are sold at a constant rate through the FY) and 100,000 per truck in 2023, equates to 12.4 cents per mile, more than double the $.061 projected maintenance costs in the april lease presentation.  Either they plan on making a killing from maintenance, or there was some aggressive re-shuffling of numbers when maintenance went from an expense to revenue stream, or vice versa.

The same analysis of hydrogen expenses puts their per kg revenue at $4.08.  Still low, but a hefty sum above their $2.47 cost average on the leasing slide.

If we use their projected FCEV maintenance revenue of $.124, $4.08 per kg H2 revenue, and $235,000 truck price depreciated over 7 years w/no interest expense, **the cost of ownership, according to their income projections, is $1 per mile** for a 100,000 mile year.  **More than they say a diesel will cost**.  OOPS!

That’s most of what I wanted to talk about.  It’s pretty clear that Nikola cannot possibly make a profit with their lease model, and Nikola’s finance department has indirectly acknowledged this.  Hydrogen tech is still many, many years away.  Nikola’s move fast and break things approach (though I’m not convinced we’ve seen much moving outside of gravity assists) will end up a “move fast and bankrupt things” strategy.

&#x200B;

I now want to take a few moments to look at some of the sillier things I found in my research:

In a laughably exuberant turn of events, Nikola projects 25% gross margins during their first year of production.  That’s downright cute!  They plan on, ostensibly, slapping GM FCs & batteries on IVECO platforms, and beating the margins of all publicly traded auto companies sans Ferrari within a few months of production start.  It's that easy.  Get your shit together, Ford!

On Nikola’s website under their trucks, they have a comparison of FCs, BEVs, and Diesel where they seem to forget their trucks have hundreds of kWhs of battery storage onboard.  They claim “Hydrogen acts as a buffer and grid balance,” while “batteries are a drain on the grid.”  You heard it hear first, folks, batteries can’t be used as a grid buffer, only a grid drain.  They also claim H2 is the “most abundant element on the planet,” while “Batteries \[are\] made of non-renewable resources; dangerous/costly to mine.”  Makes me wonder why they chose to put so many on their trucks.  Also hilariously hypocritical, considering Platinum -required for PEMFCs- is one of the rarest metals on earth.

**Design considerations and odd choices:**

I want to take a moment to talk about chassis design and the implications of Nikola’s set power parameters.  And I want to start with a quote from Elon Musk during the Tesla Semi reveal:

“We designed the Tesla truck like a bullet,” Musk said. “A normal diesel truck is designed like a barn wall.” The Tesla Semi is more aerodynamic than a $2 million Bugatti Chiron sports car, he said.

A bold claim, but I believe this to be correct.  Cheesy, but correct.  Why?  Cooling requirements.  The more cooling air you need, the less favorable aerodynamics you’ll have.  In the simple representation of an engine, there is a fuel input, a work output, and a heat output.  A gas engine  -especially one not designed with fuel efficiency in mind like the Chiron’s- will likely only output \~20-25% of its fuel input as a work output.  The Chiron makes 1,500 hp, and needs to reject 4,500-6,000 hp of heat at full throttle.  The goal of a Chiron isn’t to slip through the air, au contraire.  It’s designed suck in as much air as possible for cooling and brute it’s way to 270 mph through raw horsepower.  Most modern sedans have more favorable aerodynamics than a Bugatti.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, about 90% of the inputs from an EV charger make it to the wheels -- a major factor that makes EVs so efficient.  This means Elon can put, for example, 1000 hp of motors in his truck and only worry about rejecting 100 hp of heat at full load, an easy task.  That’s less cooling than a Prius needs, and the truck can be designed with virtually zero air input constraints.  He can swing his “3x the acceleration” dick around, and the only tradeoff is beefier driveline bits for the extra torque and bigger motors.

C\_D lists on wikipedia:  Note almost every production car below Cd=.24 is either a small displacement diesel or electric.  No supercars in sight.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile\_drag\_coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_drag_coefficient)

The Chiron’s standard Cd is .38.  A 1995 ford windstar minivan has a standard Cd of .35.  Not exactly a prestigious club, haha:

[https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/a32329/these-rare-development-photos-tell-the-full-bugatti-chiron-story/](https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/a32329/these-rare-development-photos-tell-the-full-bugatti-chiron-story/)

Hydrogen is a different story.  The thermal efficiency of a FCEV -above 50% load- will dip down into the 40-50% range.  The average efficiency of a diesel truck is \~45%, and it will dip to \~35% at max rpm, full load.  ‘Ever seen the video where Trevor says the production trucks won’t need as much cooling as their current prototypes?  He’s lying through his teeth.  A 1000 hp FC would need more than 1000 hp of cooling; as much if not more than a 500hp diesel.  It's also important to note that less heat is lost in exhaust from a PEMFC, and lower operating temps mean that actual cooling airflow required is significantly more than an equivalent diesel would require.  500 hp diesels are already built like a brick with a front aftercooler & radiator the size of a football field.  Trevor’s dick swinging has major consequences.  More cooling means more drag, more weight in heat sinks/radiators, and more power draw to move coolant.  These all create positive feedback loops, e.g. more air requirements mean less favorable aerodynamics & more drag, which means more power draw at speed, which means more cooling, which means more air requirements...  It’s not all fun and games like the pure BEV Tesla is making.

&#x200B;

Daimler’s recently announced H2 semi offering only has 300 kW, and they can recycle their waste heat to warm up incoming liquid hydrogen, Nikola uses compressed hydrogen and won’t have the same luxury.  Running so much horsepower is a real head scratcher; one would think their head of R&D’s only experience was pouring concrete or something.

&#x200B;

It’s also important to note US tractor-trailers are hard capped at 80,000 lbs.  This means that every pound of tractor weight is a pound taken from potential cargo.  Y’know… the part that actually makes money.  One has to wonder why Nikola is keeping \~5000 lbs of batteries on the tractor; their website showed they aren’t fans of the stuff.  It’s enough to run a loaded tractor two full hours on battery alone, more than a regenerative braking system would require or power peaking during a hill climb.  It’s dumb; 100 kWh would be more than enough when an on-demand primemover like a hydrogen cell is also onboard.  It’s an expensive and opulent display to the vexation of customers, who would, in all likelihood, much prefer an extra 2 tons of cargo capacity.

Features like 1000 hp and 250 kWh of battery appeal more to retail investors than trucking companies.

&#x200B;

Actual conclusion time:  I think that I pretty conclusively showed that:

1. Nikola’s hydrogen cost projections are bogus.  There isn’t even enough money there to pay for the electrolysis and compression, much less maintenance, depreciation, or labor.
2. Nikola’s leasing costs undercutting diesel is bogus.  One can disprove that with their own financial projections, much less the real costs of FCs and H2 electrolysis.
3. Nikola’s plan to lease the trucks is totally divorced from reality, according to their own financial projections.
4. Nikola’s projected per mile operating & maintenance expenses are beyond indefensible.
5. A myriad of odd, marketing focused design choices limit the trucks on-road efficiency and utility to potential customers.

If you look at any volatility period over the past couple of  years ( august 2015, start of 2016, brexit etc ) you will see a pattern on how  decline of any securities  thread in r/investing develops , the basic framework is the same and usually follows the same pattern:

1. some bullshit happens , sp500( or crypto or oil, whatever ) opens with monstrous  -0.63% , people wake up with Robinhood accounts been in the red and the grief of loosing 27$ of life savings makes them start a thread asking wise people of r/investing about imminent correction and what to do in this macro environment

2. sp500 crushes to -.81%, thread getting traction with people giving each other advice how shit is on discount and we should all buy the dip and prices lower then yesterday bla bla bla, cant time the market and some quote from Buffett, cb_hanson gets triggered about market timing says something about selling volatility and how its predictable and posts 60 page pdf , none has time to read this shit because everyone is thinking if they should add to NFLX or NVDA  with extra 100$ they need for food but  YOLO and ramen for a month will work

3.sp500 drops  -1.3%, the first sign of correction thread is someone posting quote about blood in the streets and buying, people argue about historic context and brag about how awesome dividends are on their stocks,  , argument starts about what's better dividend or capital appreciation and people find out that apparently dividend is not some magical fairy money from thin air, minds get blown


4. someone notices that bonds are up , discussion starts what the fuck are bonds and why you even need them , MCS says something reasonable about how they reduce volatility and provide better risk adjusted return and that 80/20 is pretty much 100/0 with much lower volatility and almost same return, someone admits they are 90/10 so they can buy on the dip , gets called conservative pussy. Note: any discussion about bonds ever on the sub ends in hydrocianade telling someone to go fuck themselves after arguing about where yield and price are the same or not

5. somewhere in the middle of shitstorm dvdmovie1 posts a reasonable comment about how sick and tired he is from this bullshit posts about corrections and volatility nothing new and you should own good companies but gets dragged into argument about Ford and how awesome their dividend is trying to educate people why Ford stock sucks

6. after sp500 dives to -2.03% another 10 threads appear in sub because everyone has a special unique problem and they want a special attention, mods merge threads, top post is ALWAYS  suicide hotline  and bits of wisdom how its just money, link to scene from margin call gets posted, everybody talks how awesome that movie is

share price,investing,PRPL - cash is king; significant upside unappreciated in current share price,"PRPL - cash is king and upside unappreciated

I am on a mobile phone so will keep this short. Apologies for the shitty formatting. Net of the note is that PRPL has generated nearly $70mm of cash in the first two months of Q2, which means profits are surging beyond imagination through its DTC transformation. The share price at $18 drastically undervalues this.

A few facts:

- At Q1 end, the company reported $26mm of cash, 42mm of inventory, and 52mm of accounts payable
- As of the business update released in early June, the company reported a May month end cash balance of $96 million (an increase of $70 million in just two months as sales increase)

https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-Business-Update-Ahead-of-Participation-in-Oppenheimer-20th-Annual-Consumer-Growth-Conference/default.aspx

- In May alone, they recorded 90mm plus of orders, 71m from DTC, an increase of 125%
- The company has nearly 50mm shares outstanding fully diluted, an enterprise value of nearly $1B, and 25mm of EBITDA, trading at a 17x multiple 

So let’s talk about cash. If the company’s cash in April and May increased solely on operating income, that would mean they generated an incremental 70mm of EBITDA and nearly $1.40 per share. However, this is likely overstated as the company noted inventories decreased and DTC orders are cash in advance (you pay before you get the product).

Let’s assume inventory declined by 25%, which is a massive number operationally particularly as sales are increasing, which would explain $10mm of the cash increase. The other variable is the uplift from DTC, which has grown from a run rate of about 20-30mm a month in Q1 to 70mm of orders in May. The question is what value between 0 and 70 did cash benefit by customers paying cash ahead of receiving inventory (deferred revenue) vs what was recognized into earnings. Because DTC has been ramping through the last 60-90 days, I’d think this has been normalizing to a steady state at this point. Let’s assume half is a working capital benefit. 

So of the 70mm cash benefit, 35 was from DTC pre orders and 10 mm from inventory, leaving 25mm for true cash from earnings. On 50mm shares, that is 50 cents a share for the first two months of the quarter. Assume another month of consistency to April and May, you are at 0.75 a share, just in one quarter on an 18 dollar share price. 

Assuming that is right, that means EBITDA is doubling for the full year in just one quarter and in track to generate nearly 150mm of EBITDA for the next year. 

Giving them a 10x multiple (consistent with TPX) implies 50% upside to the share price. Giving them a growthier multiple due to surging demand, which is appropriate - let’s say 15x to be conservative - would imply a 2.3b tev, or 100%+ upside to the share price in the near term. 

When will the market appreciate this and price it in? Well, they should already but because the company is newer and less followed, they aren’t yet. But once earnings are crystallized in q2 and announced in mid August, it should be obvious to all. My guess is shares will be trading at or north of $30 once earnings are released.

COVID appears to be accelerating their DTC momentum and mgmt is more or less telling us they will have an absolute blow out quarter by giving us their end of month cash balances.

They are worth more than every other car maker out there combined at $600 billion and they sell 1% of the worlds cars. Say they sell 10% of the world's cars in the next few years, are they still worth $600 billion? Do these battery projects and other platforms they are creating with solar have potential? It's hard to put a number on it but I would say 1/10th of its current value. There will be plenty of greater fools in the meantime though.","OK sure.  Tesla's latest quarterly earnings are $.76 / share.  Forward earnings range from a low of $.60 to a high of $1.20.  Annualized for 2021 that gets us somewhere in the $2.25 to $6.43 range.   In the last few years Tesla has had 7 quarters where it substantially beat estimates 4 where it fell short and only 1 where it came in close.  Earnings are unstable and that demands extra risk premium.  

Revenue for 2021 looks something like $35-53b.  Very unstable for a car company as well.  Revenue has been growing about 25% annually which is very good.  That demands a bit of premium.  

With those kinds of numbers I think something like a 25 P/E makes sense.  So around $80 / share for the high.  

 ROE is just bad at 4.9%.  That's offset by the fact that Tesla is selling equity at extreme prices.  But structurally that has me worried.  Additionally Tesla has only $12.50 in tangible assets per share.    Certainly Tesla is a strong value at around $25 / share.  Its hard to argue for more than $80 and that might be too high.  

So I'll use $50 as my figure."

Snowflake shares surged more than 150% in its market debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, in the largest ever software IPO.

share price,investing,BTU share price drivers and share price effect:,"Thinking about Nord Stream explosions.

Natural Gas storage in Europe ~ 93%. Enough for this winter. What is the long term solution? Coal fired generation plant decommissioning in Germany and other location being deferred (but for the sake of the environment must be done).

Coal companies (Arch, BTU) are seeing much improved EPS.

BTU’s third quarter EPS is indicated at ~$2 based on ~162 million shares on an (MSN) financial website.

Other websites show ~144 million shares in the (diluted) pool. So are EPS really ~13% higher?

Institutional and Insider share holdings are ~ 82% of float. (Based on the 144 million share float)

18% of 144 million is ~26 million shares in the ‘active’ float.

As of 09/15/22 ~15 million shares are ‘shorted’.  (~58% of ‘active’ float),

Average daily trade ~ 6 million shares. (23% of ‘active’ float traded every day?)

2 1/2 days to cover short interest-if shorts were the only ones buying.

Russian long term shut out of coal sales. Coal prices near record highs, situation not to change soon.

BTU earnings more than enough to retire all debt. Two ‘parts’ of the corporation retired $20.4 million in long term debt last month.

Who is keeping the BTU price range bound? What will the breakout price run to?

How much of next years EPS will the Institutional owners push to be paid out in dividends? Could be a significant sum if next years EPS are close to this years (guidance is ~US$8.50)

$8.50 EPS on a $25 stock? (And EPS could be significantly higher depending on which share count is correct.)

Backing up the truck.",6,"BTU is my largest position, been following it since it's bankruptcy. I'm extremely bullish on it, so keep in mind my bias. There are a couple addon things to your DD, which is off to a good start.

* Elliot owns a major chunk of BTU. They have significant sway on the board. 
* They are partially exposed to Newcastle coal prices, but a good part of their business is long term contracts, most of which are still locked in at low prices.
* They are in the process of re-negotiating long term contracts. TBD how long that takes or the results. Coal prices worldwide are high.
* They sell coal for delivery into the futures market, and got margin called last spring on their short futures position. It was massive, and they had to dilute to post additional collateral. The current price reflects that. Those hedges are rolling off over the next two quarters. They will get that cash back on their balance sheet.
* They're restricted from doing buybacks/divvies from their loan covenants/surety agreements. This was part of the bankruptcy restructuring. Bond holders want to be paid first. BTU is net cash positive and printing money, so it's really only a matter of time before these are paid off and they unlock this restriction.
* They have earnings in October, and an investor day (first in years!) in November. Likely a big announcement coming then. It's speculated they may enter into a debt agreement with JPM, and will unlock buybacks and/or analyst coverage.
* BTU delivers most of it's US coal via rail, so the rail strike & subsequent union agreement (signed three days ago, now in writing) is a major win for them, since it removes delivery uncertainty.
* Literally nobody follows them, outside of a few obscure analysts and some fintwit sleuths. Listen to their earnings call sometimes. They're still very under-the-radar.

As for the price action, I've been trading and watching the stock for a while now. Here are my opinions:

* Peabody filed for bankruptcy during a raging bull market in 2020, after a long commodity bear market. Literally nobody outside of some extremely savvy value investors wanted to buy it. A bunch of people bought it for under $4, so when it spiked up above $20, there was quite a bit of profit taking.
* Convertible bond owners getting stock and taking profit.
* BTU has always had a decent amount of options activity. Since they can't do divvies or buybacks yet, it's the perfect stock to wheel. A percentage of the daily volume is driven by options. BTU typically traded around ~100 vol for a while. Now that it's rangebound, it's been in the 80s.
* Value investing (and commodity investing) has sucked for a long time since rates have been low. Plus, it's a coal stock, and has an ESG score of like zero lol. A lot of institutions CAN'T own it. So who owns it? Some retail, some sophisticated investors, a few small hedge funds, and Elliot. This creates volatility because those groups are much more active investors and are willing to punt the stock around.
* People were still trying to short it. Remember, it went bankrupt twice, so was perceived as an easy target.

The underlying doesn't have to be a stock. It can be an index. And it can also be a futures contract. 

I don't trade futures, but I have considered trading options on /es and /rty futures instead of \^spx or \^rut. But with futures, you have to also deal with contango and backwardation and the strategies can get more interesting/complex. 

As for leverage - leverage on futures can be higher since margin is calculated differently using SPAN. But with options, if you are trading from a portfolio margin (not to be confused with Reg-T margin) account, you may get similar amount of leverage. 

As for losing more than 100% - it depends on the strategies being employed. For a trader that is writing option contracts, you can lose more than the initial value of the contract. For an option buyer, your max loss is limited to the value of the contracts when the position is opened. So for options, the risk characteristics are dependent on the strategies being employed.","Please stay away from futures if your asking these questions.

A future contract is exactly that, you promise to buy or sell the underlying at that price. An option contract owner has the option to choose if he/she wants to exercise or not. In an future contract both sides must fulfill their contractual obligation (to buy or to sell).

For example /es e-mini future on s&p 500 is around 4630 points right now. Every 1 point is 50$, if s&p500 tanks to 2630 its a 2000x50$= 100k loss or win (depending if long or short).

Also if it rips to 5000 its a 370x50$ = 18.5k$ move.

If you owned the option you paid the premium to choose if you want to exercise or not. If you buy a call and the underlying tanks you just loose your premium. If you buy a future contract and the underlying tanks you have to pay up (there is no choice, remember)"

That price error would never occur on such a high liquidity market as tesla options.

Look at the bid and ask during market hours (normal trading hours, not after-market or pre-market). The actual price is somewhere between the bid and the ask. 

With regards to this specific trade, an option that deep in the money will mostly just be priced by the underlying - you could easily see a call of that duration at $800 with Tesla at $876 pricing just a little bit under $100 even with the vol you are seeing on Tesla.

Right now, Tesla options are very expensive because the stock has been very volatile. There's no free lunch here. You could make a ton of money, but you could just as easily lose all of the money you put in. Be very careful.

This really should be a 200 level since it involves some numbers (although you won't yet need a calculator), but I'll just keep the numbering sequential for OCD sake.  On that note, I'm aiming this at people who read and understood the first two - which were brief but dense.  Also we're getting to the point where I can't generalize options as much, so note that this post (and probably the rest) is geared more towards trading options (as opposed to things like hedging, or using as synthetic instruments).  As usual corrections are welcome.


**Disclaimer:** I am writing this as an educational supplement.  My motivation for writing these has been explicitly to help fill the gap in more advanced conversations.  By no means am I encouraging anyone to trade with this information.  It's worth pointing out that in efforts to make these short and productive I've trimmed out the potentially ridiculous risk with options.  Perhaps I'll dedicate an entire post for that.



.



**EXCHANGE**

Quick note on this.  Unlike stocks which are listed in specific exchanges (like NASDAQ or NYSE), stock options are not bound to a particular exchange since they're essentially just bets.  It's worth knowing that the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, is the biggest among them (there's like 9 or so 
other ones) and is home to the all popular VIX (more on this at a later date).  But to make things simple when picking an exchange, there's usually a ""[Best](http://i.imgur.com/rreWD.png)"" choice which figures it out for you.


.


**THE MARKET**

So, it's finally time to pick some options.  Well just like stocks, the first stop is to check out the prices.  But now we're going to pay special attention to the market as well, because although market conditions play a part in stocks, they play a crucial role with options.  Also, if you're speculating on a price move, the trick is to shop around for opportunities involving **various strategies** using options and/or stocks, because there are **many ways to bet**.  Many more than just up or down, that is.  

While looking at buying options, a good rule of thumb is to make sure there's healthy (a lot of) volume.  Having a **liquid market** will make sure that there's enough buyers and sellers to get in and back out of the position with relative ease.  It's entirely possible that you buy an option and then have nobody to sell it back to (at a half-way reasonable price) when the time is right.  

This also tends to tighten up the **bid/ask spread** (remember: bid is sell price, ask is buy price).  This is another big difference with options.  Typically when buying stocks, as long as they're somewhat popular, I don't even look at the spread - in fact most popular stock ""quoters"" won't even show them.  But you'll notice that options chains rarely have a single price and instead show you the bid/ask separately.  The reason for this is that with options, pennies matter.  And the spread will consume into your profits.  

Take a look at this [chain for LVS](http://i.imgur.com/P41JM.png) with March expiration.  You'll see that there are some options with 1 cent spread (green) and others with 15 cent spreads (red).  If you were to buy options from the red circle, you're instantly losing $15 dollars PER CONTRACT not to mention commissions.  I just checked some AAPL Jan '14 calls and some of them have like a $3 spread.  That's $300.00 per contract instantly evaporated!

The 2 factors I can think of that determine liquidity are **option popularity** (some stocks don't attract options traders) and **strike price / expiration date**.  Even popular stocks lose volume if you look to far ahead or if you pick strike prices that are far from ""the money.""  

Make that 3.  **Open Interest** (or OI or Op Int).  This is a metric that you'll typically see in options chains indicating the number of ""live contracts"" which are out on the market. High OI would imply that there's high volume. The reason why volume and OI are not necessarily the same, is because in practice you can write a contract (create a new one, and adding +1 to the OI tally) and later buy it back (subtracting -1 to OI tally).  If this scenario played out in an empty market, the volume would be 2 and OI would be 0.


.



**TIMING**

Timing is everything with options.  Remember that the moment you buy an option it starts losing extrinsic value from time decay, so this is important.  As noted by [facemelt](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pnray/optionstrading_103_the_premium/c3qx7jz) in the last post, time decay is not linear.  Meaning that stocks won't lose a set amount every day until expiration.  


[Here's a graph](http://i.imgur.com/71h3M.gif) showing what the time decay looks like as dictated by the [black-scholes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes) model.  You'll notice the drop in price due to **time decay exponentially increases at 30 days from expiration**.  This doesn't mean options with less than 30 days are no good, but if you buy them it should be part of your strategy (like say, a day trade).


Another important thing to consider is recent news with the underlying stock.  Big events can temporarily dislodge prices (which you can also use in your favor, if you want).  Announced **dividends** is a big one.  For various reasons, on an ex-dividend date, call prices will go down and put prices will go up.  Another big one is **earnings** releases.  You'll notice a huge buildup in premiums (due to implied volatility) as an earnings release approaches, and then a huge drop the day after.  This affects calls and puts alike.  


.


**EDIT: STRIKE PRICE**

*Credit to [CJP84](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/psxp0/optionstrading_104_mechanics_of_buying_options/c3s00hq) for bringing this up*


*Additional observation from [complaintdepartment](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/psxp0/optionstrading_104_mechanics_of_buying_options/c3s0y54) who points out that this point becomes gray area when the strike and underlying price are close*

Another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value, because after all when the expiration day comes, that's all they're worth.  So buying an option with no intrinsic value (not ITM) has the potential to be worthless upon expiration.  

That said, they're not always bad, *depending on your strategy*.  For example, buying an OTM option is sort of like buying a house with a 100% interest mortgage (your monthly mortgage payments only go towards the interest but not towards the principal of the house).  Some people actually do this, because they believe the value of the house will go up, and they'll resell it for profit.


.


**LEVERAGE**

This is a very important concept which early options traders don't realize right away, and is the reason options can be so powerful and/or dangerous.

Options harness the power of leverage by relying on changes in price to derive their values, and *not necessarily* the price of the underlying.  For example, let's compare MCD and GRPN currently trading at $100 and $20 respectively.  If you look at their March expirations options, you'll see that the price for an at-the-money call (strike prices 100 and 20) is about $1.00 for each of them.  (And yes, I realize MCD is not quite 100 yet but if you factor out intrinsic and extrinsic values you'll end up about the same).

So for $100, you can buy a call which expires next month for either of these two companies, and you've exposed yourself to 100 shares of said company. 

Now ceteris paribus, if the price of *both* GRPN and MCD went up tomorrow by 5% the price of the MCD call would go up to around $3.50 while the price of GRPN's call would go up to around $1.50.  That's the difference between profiting $250 vs $50).  

And the reason for this is because if MCD went up by 5% it would be up $5 and if GRPN went up by 5% it would only be up by $1, and the premium only cares about **relative price movement**, and not necessarily about the underlying's value (this is a simplification).

This is also why expensive stocks like AAPL and GOOG are popular with options gamblers, because as you've already seen here they can have huge swings.  And this is also how a lot of people go broke.


*I realize I sped through this topic.  If it left you confused, ask and I'll either reply or modify the post.


.



**THE CHAIN**


And finally, the chain.  This is just to tie up some of these concepts and you can see what they look like in the real world.  At first it can be overwhelming when looking at options chains, but if you know what you're looking for they're not that bad.  I'm going to show you what it looks like in OptionsHouse, but most chains will be similar in nature and information.

[Open this chain in another tab](http://i.imgur.com/XL0B7.png)


* Purple circles - **calls** and related metrics (Bid price, Ask price, Volume and Open Interest)

* Blue circles - **puts** and related metrics (Bid price, Ask price, Volume and Open Interest)

* Green circles - **expiration date**

* Cyan circles - **strike prices**

* Yellow circles - options that are at or very **near the money**

The other numbers are for a later day.

Also, to highlight the risks involved, go back and look at the February expiration contracts still open under OI (both calls and puts) which are expiring worthless tomorrow.  If you go back and look at March's prices you'll pretty much get an idea of what those contracts were worth a month ago.  That's a lot of money lost.

> Another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value, because after all when the expiration day comes, that's all they're worth.

  That's a little bit misleading, because only as we get very close to expiration do we know who is in the money. In other words, you could argue that it is more risky to buy a slightly in the money option than a slightly out of the money option because now you are risking the intrinsic value as well."

""with the steepest penalties hitting certain beef,  live plants, dyed flowers, and a range of fruits and vegetables. The  tariffs would range from 5 percent to 25 percent "".

current stock price,investing,Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble!,"Lately, there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever.

>Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11)Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - [Bank of America](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11)

Even professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.

>This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/)

Adding to all of this, we can see that the [Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.](https://preview.redd.it/095t1dtniq281.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db181ad101f44183162eae205bcdb5fb857e01f)

While it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \[1\].

So what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \[2\]

**The Warning Signs**

Let’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)

**PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)**

The price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.

The current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).

The red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.

**Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)**

[1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/fzax1ecriq281.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b59bc4f2bfde765ffab5deb3376ddae53b5fe4c3) While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.

**Increasing use of leverage**

There are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.

[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \[3\]

[Research by Goldman Sachs](https://preview.redd.it/kkx1cfjtiq281.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8af5f2398c5273fc770ba1f6a265ad3ffcf1a7b) shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.

**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**

More than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.

SPACs \[4\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/)

This is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypto where [NFTs are being sold](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!

**Investor expectations**

More than the P/E ratio, **i**[nvestor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history.](https://preview.redd.it/qnfuyiqwiq281.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb279b8dae3bd9803be4b8f7bf26c1984f7a87b8) The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.

If you consider a [four-year time period](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/), stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.

Now that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,

**Are we certain it’s a bubble?**

There are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.

**Low-interest rates**

This is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the [historically low 0.25% that we have now](https://preview.redd.it/x1408niziq281.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee123520c9b2ea0d2f9b10b59d6b2fd181fac446). This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.

**New Investors**

It’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. [But the data they put out during their IPO filing](https://preview.redd.it/lpojhko0jq281.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ede81940da2355edc282ba1feca54bad415c4b0) shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.

**401(k) and Index funds**

As I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/). According to [this report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.

The key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \[5\].

**What’s the implication?**

As long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected.

**Conclusion**

The market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.

But, that’s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.

The expected annual return by investors [above inflation is a whopping 17.5%](https://preview.redd.it/b4vspq13jq281.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa81e2478da9eb80ba1b001e0a2c6b29d9313b97)(which is 161% more than what is realistic) — This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.

Even if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, [this thread from Corry Wang](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.

Basically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‘98), **making money using that information was hard!** There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.

It makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a [crash from as far back as 2017](https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/). Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!

As Peter Lynch quoted,

>Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves

stock market,investing,Russian Stock Market to Partially Reopen on Thursday,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-stock-market-prepares-for-an-unusual-reopening-11648023739

> Russia’s stock market is set to have a partial reopening Thursday, nearly a month after it shut down following the invasion of Ukraine. 
The challenge for Moscow is that the resumption of trading could simply send Russian stocks back into free fall. On Feb. 24, the day when President Vladimir Putin began the assault on Ukraine, the main Russian stock index tumbled 33%. While the index regained a fraction of those losses on Feb. 25—its last day of trading—that was before Western sanctions hammered the ruble and sent the country into an economic crisis.

>To limit the fallout, Moscow has turned to some heavy-handed policies. It blocked foreign investors from dumping local stocks—a move that some market participants saw as retaliation for a Western freeze on Russian central bank assets since a big chunk of the Russian market is owned by foreigners. The Russian government ordered its main sovereign-wealth fund to buy billions of dollars worth of shares. 

>The Russian stock market could ultimately look very different than it did before, with a plan under discussion to split it into separate markets for foreign and local investors, according to a person familiar with the matter.

>Russia’s central bank said Wednesday that it will allow trading of 33 shares out of 50 included in the benchmark stock index, the MOEX, on Thursday from 9:50 a.m. to 2 p.m. Moscow time. Among the companies to be traded are Gazprom PJSC and Lukoil PJSC. Bets on the fall of a stock, known as short-selling, will be banned.

>Under a policy announced by the central bank on Feb. 28, Russian brokerages aren’t allowed to let foreign clients sell securities. This will prevent foreigners from bolting for the exits as soon as the market reopens, which could be ruinous because of their outsize role in Russian stocks. International institutional investors held about three-quarters of the Russian market’s free float as of February 2020, according to Sberbank Investment Research.

>That has raised concerns that the market will be skewed by the absence of foreign investors, who accounted for nearly half of equities trading volume at the Moscow Exchange in the first half of last year.
“There will be an illusion of a working, recovering Russian stock market, even though a huge class of players in the market—foreigners—won’t have the opportunity to sell,” said Vladimir Kreyndel, CEO of ETF Consulting, a Moscow firm that advises issuers of exchange-traded funds. 

>Among the Western investors that held Russian stocks before the freeze were asset-management giants Vanguard Group and Fidelity International. Both firms have said they are reducing exposure to Russia.
Due to the freeze, foreign investors won’t have much to do when the stock market reopens. 

>But the plan under consideration by Russian officials—which is still in the discussion stages—would effectively split the country’s securities market in two, with one market for foreigners and another for local investors, the person familiar with the matter said. In this arrangement, foreign investors could sell their shares or bonds, but would face restrictions on moving the proceeds out of Russia because of capital controls that Moscow has imposed since February, the person said.

>Such a bifurcated market could result in oddities, such as the same stock having two different prices. That isn’t completely unprecedented. In China, there have long been discrepancies between shares on mainland exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen and those listed in Hong Kong.
It could also prevent further erosion of the ruble’s value. Russia’s currency has stabilized in recent sessions to trade near 104 rubles to the dollar, though it remains 22% weaker than before Russia invaded Ukraine.

>“The biggest fear is that the central bank is under sanctions and they don’t want foreign investors to sell their shares and take the ruble and buy hard currency,” said Jacob Grapengiesser, head of Eastern Europe at emerging markets fund manager East Capital.

>The Moscow Exchange said Monday that it would allow for the settlement of trades that foreign investors had placed before Feb. 28 that were still being processed. Mr. Grapengiesser said his firm had trades still awaiting settlement from the start of the war that he expects to go through soon. 

>“It’s a natural step before opening the market. You need to take care of those unsettled trades,” he said. “Things are slowly moving forward.”
Shortly after the war began, Russia’s prime minister ordered the country’s National Wealth Fund to buy up to one trillion rubles, equivalent to $9.38 billion, worth of shares this year. Analysts also expect some Russian oil companies to prop up their share prices with buyback programs.

>Local investors may buy stocks too. When Russia invaded Crimea, the MOEX fell almost 18% between mid-February and mid-March of 2014. But by the end of that year, it had rebounded more than 12% from that March low. The broad index has posted gains in all but one year since 2014. Stocks in unstable countries can also serve as hedges against inflation because locals expect companies can offset rising costs by charging higher prices.

>The government’s efforts have led some to be cautiously optimistic about the reopening. “Initially, I think there will be a moderate correction,” said Natalia Smirnova, a financial adviser in Moscow. “But I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the first day could end up with a modest increase.”

>Russia is a minnow of a financial market by global terms. In December 2021, the total market capitalization of companies listed on the Moscow Exchange was about $842 billion, according to the World Federation of Exchanges, which is just under 90% of the current value of Tesla Inc. That made the Moscow Exchange the 20th largest bourse by market cap, just above Brazil’s B3 exchange, in the WFE’s ranking of global exchanges.

>Until the war, Russia mostly attracted attention from specialist emerging-market funds and hedge funds, though it made up only a fraction of holdings for most globally minded investors. 

>MSCI Inc. said it would drop Russian stocks from its influential indexes that track emerging markets. Before the war, MSCI’s emerging market index had a 2.8% weighting for Russia. FTSE Russell has also announced plans to remove Russian stocks from its indexes. The moves will force investors whose holdings track the indexes to sell—when they can. 
Wars have led to stock-market shutdowns before, although it is unusual. The New York Stock Exchange closed for about four months when World War I broke out in 1914, the longest closure in the NYSE’s history. The Beirut Stock Exchange reopened in 1996 after a nearly 13-year shutdown caused by Lebanon’s civil war.",1074,[deleted],"For anyone thinking to buy the dip, my parents still have state obligations from 1990 to sell you","I’m curious if FINRA will remove the trading halt on Russian ADRs.

trading strategy,investing,"My trading strategy..,this is what works for me.","About me:

A (former) long-time investment adviser who is a very active trader. I've also worked in private equity for several years.

I'm here to share my strategy on trading and significantly increasing overall income.

I have ""rules"" that I trade by. They work for me. They're guidelines. They may or may not be for you.

I will share my trades and results. I will not discuss or offer opinions on the fundamentals of a company. I'm happy to comment (if asked) as to what trade I would enter on a company. I am not licensed to give advice.

What I do is rather simple - yet most advisers/investors know nothing about it. 

It's called covered-call writing. I'm sure many here have heard of it or used this strategy. There are various ways to implement using covered calls - I keep it as simple as possible.

Essentially - you are buying a stock, then selling the right to have the shares taken away from you at a particular price, on a specific date. For selling that right - you receive a premium (income).

My personal trading rules:

1 - Invest in companies you know, and want to be invested in. Quality companies.

2 -  Diversify industries. Banks/steel/transportation/tech/pharma etc.

3 - Hedge. I keep at least one precious metal company in my portfolio at all times.

4 - Keep your emotions in check. The market is fluid. You will be right. You will be wrong. Don't chase a stock in any direction.

5 - Use income to average down. If you are invested in several companies, not all will move in tandem. Take some of the income you've generated to average down.

6 - Sell the call option right after the purchase of shares or previous option expiry.

7 - If you use margin - only use half of what you're allowed to. Use none if you don't understand the risks.

8 - Stay short-term. The call options I sell are typically 2 to 4 weeks out. I can always by back shares if they're taken away.

9 - Be patient. Don't stare at your screen all day (unless this IS your career).

10 - Try to have an option(s) expiring every week. Generate income weekly.

I will put up a couple examples as well.",99," 1 - Invest in companies you know, and **want to be invested in**. Quality companies. 

Thank you for making this rule #1. Where I've gone wrong with covered calls in the past has been to chase yield rather than trading companies I actually wanted to own. Kids, learn from my mistakes!",You didn't mention how you choose the strike price. Isn't that a fairly important part of covered calls?,"This guy probably wasn't a very good investment advisor. The income is already accounted for in the premiums and the risk that you are taking. In the long run, theoretically, you would break even with this strategy if you were to just buy and hold. EXCEPT for the fact that covered call premium will typically be taxed at a higher rate than long term gains. 

This isn't some secret cheat code for investing. The risks and the premium are priced in. 

If you really want to sell covered calls, here's a potentially better strategy: Buy ETFs with deep options chains, sell monthly covered calls about 5% out of the money during times of high volatility. You'll still capture about 92% of the upside while generating 100-150bps per month in premium. Meanwhile, ETFs allow you to stay diversified. SPY, MDY, IWM, EFA, EEM, AGG."

I really just wanted to see what everyone thinks of my analysis.

**Signals**

Strategy: Buy when a stock has reached a new 10 day low and is trading above its 50 and 200 day moving average.  Sell when the price reaches a new 10 day high, drops below the 50 day moving average, or has been open for 10 days. 

Base case: Buy a random stock at its close and hold for a random period between 1 and 10 days.

**Methodology**

The program begins by back testing a predefined set of tickers (SP500 in this case) using the buy and sell signals listed above. In order to reduce biased results I ‘walk’ through the time period, that is I fed the program a single day at a time. Each day I calculated buy signals and if the conditions were met I'd purchase the security, hold it, and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals.
Once the security was bought and sold I'd write down the trade and move onto the next day. The end result was a list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred in the predefined date range with the predefined list of tickers.

I'd sort these entries by purchase date in ascending order (oldest first) and every trade that fell on the same day was put into a list and archived in a dictionary with key-word purchaseDate. The result was a data structure I could query and pull a list of all trades that could have occurred on a specified date.

I then had all the information I needed to begin the actual back test. I began with the first possible purchase date, searched the dictionary to obtain a list of all possible trades that could have occurred on that day, chose one at random, wrote down the trade's information, and moved onto the next available purchase date.

Once all dates were exhausted I calculated an annual return by finding the product of all the year's trades. I did this 10,000 times in order to obtain the average and standard deviation of annual returns. Since my data didn't tell me which trade occurred when it was impossible for me to define the exact sequence of trades. My idea was if I got enough random trade sequences I could create a universe of possible scenarios with the most likely being the most prevalent -- it was a way for me to calculate a return and cover all my bases at the same time.",215,"You know, I backtested hundreds of moving averages, holding period dates, crossovers, technical signals, and many various combinations.  I even tried various backtests with quantifiable macro numbers like monthly ISM, and even with fundamentals likes PEs.  I've backtested a lot of these and found returns above that of an index.  When I implemented these systems, however, they do not work.  I was curve fitting and data mining.  I suspect you will find the same conclusion.",Great work. What program do you use?,"I own a quant trading shop and I tested this out in my simulation system for fun.  I expanded the universe and did some basic screening to filter out stocks that aren't liquid or easily executed.  I bought $10k per position (round lots), so you'd need about $5 million to run this at that level, assuming my liquid universe.

This indicator seemed to have worked OK until fall 2009 but hasn't worked since.  A $5 million investment in SPY would have been more profitable over the past 10 years."

So I have 2 stocks I like in a particular sector that have been following for a couple years… very close in price with minor variability (talking about usually 10 cents in difference in extremes).

Instead of timing price, I like to sell a majority of one stock at the higher price and buy the lower price stock for a few cents cheaper per share. This results in increasing total number of shares of stock.  Then the lower priced stock will rise to within one or two cents or higher priced stock (sometimes surpass it). I will then liquidate shares back into the other stock and rinse and repeat.

Focused on two penny stocks in the energy sector but i wonder if this is a common strategy with blue chip stocks and if so which ones?",0,"I sometimes will hear the term ""correlated pairs trade"" when discussing this sort of strategy.

If you are trading different issues from the same issuer, for example, trading a preferred against a common from the same company, that could be described as an ""arbitrage"".","This is pairs or spread trading, a type of stat arb.  99.99% of the time it works when you control the position size.  Then once in a decade or two, you get a LTCM, where the spread does not revert until you are broken.","If the stocks are correlated this is a real trading strategy, but it’s just called trading. It doesn’t have its own name. It’s a form of arbitrage so maybe you could call it that.
Usually you would short the overpriced one to buy the underpriced one."
trading strategy,investing,Anyone ever try a VIX strategy for swing trading?,"I’m just getting started with investing, but I was speaking to a person at my kid’s school the other day that mentioned he buys the VIX when it dips below $20 and sells when it is above $30. 

I downloaded the data for the last year and using this strategy would have led to two buys/sells, for a gain of 65% and 54% respectively. That’s doubling your money in one year.

I know the VIX is volatile by nature, but it seems to hit the $20 and $30 levels at least a few times a year, going back 2 years. 

Would it be crazy to follow such a strategy?",27,It's not clear from your post: are you aware you cannot 'buy' VIX? What instrument is this person using?,"Let me chime in here. I've been traded the VXX exclusively every day for 5 years. 

Is it profitable for me? Yes, sort of. Not as profitable as buying and holding though. 

Is it fun? Oh yes it is, tremendously exciting and rewarding. Basic strategy is literally buy low, average down when it falls and sell when it spikes. 

Easy to say, but in practice you really have to accept that for 7 days it will trend down then something like the bank debacle happens and it saves your ass.

It is gambling pure and simple but am up 26,500 this year on simple 500/1000 share buys at a time ( i have a large cash account), then sell when I hit a daily profit of 800-1200.

Today I made 4k riding it from 43.82 to 45.68. it is sooo fun when it spikes. Something about making money when everybody else is losing money tickles the senses. And it happens so fast.

It is an atrocious long term hold though, read all about contago and how it keeps buying future contracts. So my strategy likely blows up if market rallies consistently for months.

options market,stocks,"THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS","From many news media outlets and youtuber finance experts and stock gurus, I keep seeing the notion that the stock market is heavily overvalued currently relative to its former valuation metrics that have held for decades. 

To be honest, this is true, and they're not wrong, but what they fail to take into account is that until interest rates go up and/or median home prices come down, for the VAST majority of Americans there are only the following ways of avoiding poverty: education (becoming less and less worth it for most degrees), fraud (risky AND makes you a piece of shit), literal gambling, poker (which I don't classify as gambling if you're highly skilled but is NOT easy to be consistently profitable), starting your own business / youtube / social media (risky if you go all in and not definitely for everyone), and investing in stocks (admirable, and dramatically easier than all of the above to be profitable). Investing in housing is a very viable way to make money, but when the median home price is $400,000 this is no longer accessible to the everyday American for younger generations as a means of building wealth (fuck boomers, they have literally written and enacted laws that benefit them and only them throughout their lives).

Until investing is no longer the ""easy"" and accessible way to succeed in life for the everyday American, the stock market is going to perpetually be ""overvalued"" by former metrics and dips will always have rapid recoveries.   


So when people and institutions say that the market is ""overvalued"" take this with a grain of salt and when the market reaches ""insane valuations"" rest assured you can ignore this until there is another more reliable means of ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO FUCKING RETIRE SOME DAY.",2684,Are stock prices going up? Or is money losing value?,"The very fact that 401ks are the primary retirement vehicle for the overwhelming majority of Americans ensures the markets, over time, are guaranteed to be higher. Billions are pumped into the system on a monthly basis, that will continue to occur.",An argument can be made that it's overvalued because trading and investing HAVE become more accessible to the average American.
options market,stocks,Why does pre market exist and why are options not included?,"Seems pretty unfair that the market is only “open” from 9:30-4pm yet trading can still take place practically all day long. It really sets you up for failure when a stock closed high but then opens at half its price. I know that “I can trade after hours too” but seriously I cant possibly pay attention to something from 4am-8pm every day. 

And why aren’t options tradable? I am supposed to just sit there and watch my options loss all its value in pre market but cant do anything about it? If the price can change after hours why cant I tend to my options? 

Doesn’t make sense to me.",925,"Mostly to concentrate liquidity.

Most options aren't sufficiently liquid (ITM and OTM ones) even during normal open market hours with wide big ask spreads.

Even stocks when they trade in premarket or afterhours have bad liquidity.

A stock has just a single ticker, but for every stock there are maybe hundreds of options prices across strikes and all expiries.

For market markers it isn't worth the trouble in non market hours for options. They generally have to hedge their option positions they are selling you by immediately buying/selling stocks but the afterhour stocks market isn't liquid enough to do it efficiently. 

Thus providing MM activity of those hundreds of quotes for each share which themselves are illiquid isn't lucrative, hence nobody demands afterhours for options.

It is better to have option buyers/ seller concentrate their trade activities in limited market hours window than spreading it over entire day. 

Index futures which are way more liquid for example are allowed to trade 23 hours each day. So it is all about liquidity.","**Market hours:** Those are a hold-over from non-electronic trading days. It's hard to change up the status quo. It forces everyone to trade in the same time period and not give an advantage to hedge funds located in different time zones. There's no reason this couldn't open up more, but it's been this way for its entire history up until about 2 years ago so it'll take time to change

&#x200B;

**After hours trading:** This isn't done on the same market as the ""market is open"" market. It's happening on what is called the ECN. This system matches up buyers and sellers and is independent of the market price. That's why a stock can run up or down crazy amounts after hours. But when the market opens the prices in the AH don't matter - that's why they snap to the opening price. AH price CAN affect market price, but usually the volume in the AH is so low compared to the open market that it really doesn't. This isn't to screw the retail trader, it's just the way it works.

Imagine you and a buddy buy a bunch of candy and after the grocery store closes you decide to sell the candy. You may be able to drive the price up because the supply is low and demand is high, but as soon as the store opens again the price of that candy is going to snap back to market prices

&#x200B;

**Options:** Options prices are affected by the stock prices. As stated above, after market close the actual, real price of the stock isn't moving so options prices aren't moving either. You selling your candy after the store closes isn't affecting the price of the candy in the store, so the options you bought for that store candy isn't changing price either. You can't trade options after hours because they're in the grocery store with the candy and the store is closed. That's not to screw you, it's just like asking ""Why isn't my gas mileage improving"" when your car is off. Because you're not moving.",Isn’t OP describing the functions of regulatory bodies?

options market,stocks,"Can anyone explain the theory that ""they"" (market makers/hedge funds/whoever) push a price down to avoid having to pay out for call options?","I heard a commentor somewhere mention it in passing, but they didn't explain it in detail.

They hypothesized that people would have calls on NVDA which went up a lot in the after hours last night, but that today ""they"" (market makers/hedge funds/someone?) would push the price down to avoid having to pay out for those calls.

Can someone explain this in more depth? 

Also, can someone who actually worked in an institution/hedge fund/market maker verify whether they ACTUALLY do this? It sounds very odd, is it illegal? It also seems dangerous because if they think a stock should go up, and they force the price down by SELLING TONS OF SHARES, it seems like a risky gamble because what if it doesn't work and now they have even less shares.

 I feel like when this idea gets brought up, it's always by people who have no experience working in the industry, so how would they actually know it happens? What if it's just a conspiracy like ""oh the bad guys came and pushed down the price of my stock and that's why I lost money"". 

Does anyone have links to interviews or youtube videos where industry people actually say this really happens? (No offense but if a person has never worked in the industry, how would they know that this kind of stuff happens? It would be like trusting a person with no military experience to tell you about secret strategies only people deep in the military would know)",491,"I worked at a relatively large options market maker as a trader and thought I would drop my two cents here. Fair warning my company mostly focused on commodities and futures in the big index funds. 

First, Ill say it plainly there was never a time where the price of an underlying was purposefully manipulated in an attempt to avoid loses from the price of the underlying at my company. This has happened before and been prosecuted, the most high profile case that I know of being Optiver's ""Hammer"" manipulating the price of oil ([Link here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-optiver-settlement/high-frequency-trader-optiver-pays-14-million-in-oil-manipulation-case-idUSBRE83J01220120420)) and it is very illegal. There are cases though where from an outside perspective it can appear to happen that way. In options markets specifically smaller markets (think Oil, natural gas and agricultural products)  there are often large participants putting through order flow that dominates not just one market maker but all market makers inventory. This type of flow is typically initiated through direct brokers to market maker connections. By doing it this way the customer putting on this large position is able to get more size at a better overall price than if they had traded it electronically (or that's the idea).  This then causes the entire position held by MMs to be relatively similar (because its being dominated by this big trade) . Where we begin to see effects on the price of the underlying is when we approach expiration, close to one of the strikes with a huge position. This reduction in time, and relatively small difference between inventory position and underlying price causes the gamma of the options to increase (and change) very quickly.  With this rising gamma and the assumption that most market makers don't want to hold any position causes them to start to hedge. This hedging is in a direct relationship to the gamma they hold, the strange behavior starts to arise when the entire MM group is short gamma in this area. The situation starts to play out like this:

1. Price of the underlying is $99, MMs as a whole are short a large amount of gamma from shorts on the $100 strike. 
2. The price of the underlying moves to $99.50. MM have picked up MORE (a lot more) short gamma and have accumulated negative deltas. 
3. MMs **individually** decide when their delta risk has become too great and BUY the underlying to hedge this risk. This pushes the price of the underlying up. 
4. The price of the underlying is $100 and it is expiring in 2 hours, MMs have either hedged their delta (one or multiple times) driving the price up causing them to hedge more. IF they haven't hedged they have huge short deltas more than likely dominating the risks in their book. On top of this they are looking at pin risk of expiring near their short. 
5. MMs continue to hedge through 100 and push the price to 101, this causes their short gamma to decrease and forces them to SELL the shares they bought on the way up driving the price back towards 100. 

This type of situation is amplified by a small market where futures trade thinly creating competition for the available shares. Now in the case that you are the luck person or even better other MM who happened to avoid the massive trade earlier and can remain long gamma in that area you get the opposite effect and get to buy on the way up and sell on the way down AKA ""Gamma Scalping"". The bottom line is from the outside it looks like the price is being forced to a certain price but its only that way because of individual action being taken by market makers with a similar position. 

Hope this helps, feel free to drop questions if you have them.","Market makers have the ability to route broker trades through the exchange they fancy. Securities being sold will go through lit exchanges impacting price negatively while they will route buys to ""dark pools"" that dont end up impacting the demand side of the equation. They can do the opposite as well. This is how Market makers can suppress or pump the price of certain securities whenever they want to its in their rights.","The price of calls didn't go up. The underlying went up after hours. Options don't trade after hours so it would be impossible for the price of the contracts to go up when the market is closed.

What you're asking about is something called max pain which is the largest number of OI on a specific strike price. Market makers will hedge based on certain formulas that assume possible movements in the underlying but they don't control the price. Theoretically the price should be based on supply and demand, that's a whole different discussion though based on your understanding of ATS's."

options market,stocks,Ford Motors $F why the options market shows us the future...$gme $rkt $amc $tsla all started in options markets...," 

My thesis ( I am not a financial advisor) is follow the options market this is how I found RKT! Options are how $tsla kept skyrocketing deep OTM calls slowly getting pushed into the money by delta hedging. This happened with $gme and today with $rkt as well! This is how you would have found Gamestop $GME... When calls are very cheap and there are thousands of them expect BIG moves in the stock for SMALL PRICES since options are very leveraged especially deep OTM calls. Also be very mindful of Call/verse put ratios. For ford the calls greatly outright the puts but that's only half the story. The puts that are there are for strikes OUT of the money meaning they are getting weaker and weaker as we get higher and higher! 

The $12.50 calls are now in the money as of today and creeping up to the $13 calls once we pass the $13 there is no coming back down IMO! [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/options?p=F) 16,000+ $13 calls moving ever so close to being in the money giving more gamma to squeeze for this week 3/5 and then next week another 5000+ ... that’s just the contracts for the next two weeks. If you dig deeper the number get insane. 3/19 is also another massive call option day and helps push the gamma squeeze.

To put it into perspective. Today the 3/5 $13 calls started out a .03 cents!!! They got up as high as .18 you literally could have made 6x your money buying the bottom and selling the top and it didn’t even matter if the stock hits $13 by this Friday. Of course no one is that perfect at timing it but hey even if you bought at .05 and sold at .10 double the money in a few hours... or attempt to hold and reach $13 by Friday is very possible so many ways to play the Ford rally!

My Position I thought you'd never ask.  2200 shares 12.50c 3/5 , 13c 3/5 , 8c 6/8

Call options give great insight into bull/bear movement. Remember last week went everything was RED besides GME and AMC?. Ford was down too but very very small % like 2-3% most things were down 10% and then today $Ford skyrocketed up a lot harder than other because it has lots of call options gamma effecting the price. There are almost no puts negatively effect the price. Look at the puts! Almost nothing in the money and the further we get away from $11 and $12 the less those ones effect the price! People were BUYING more calls correctly during that massive RED sell off day last week. Cheaper calls help rocket the stock back up!

Then adjusted his timeline to Jan-Feb 2022. He sold out of several stocks in November. Then went all in last two weeks of December thinking there would be rally in Jan 2022.

My goal is to hold the stocks in my portfolio perpetually, though I'm not reserved to make adjustments and sell when a) I see an opportunity to take profits b) my thesis changes. My long term goal is passive income generation, though I don't chase yields. I don't pay much attention to valuation or macro, as I think that since I plan on holding these stocks for decades while buying every month, those don't matter to me much. I invest regularly every month, so I'm okay with buying at a higher valuation at times and lower valuation at other times. In my opinion, buying at the best possible time is more difficult than buying a good company. That said, if I see an undervalued stock I like, I don't hesitate to buy more and when I make my regular contributions, I try weigh towards stocks that might have been beaten down or seem undervalued. My last review in one of these was [Dec 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6bdjt/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread/hn1ot2t/). Since then, I have made some adjustments, mostly by researching new companies and updating what I focus on when doing my analysis. I am pretty comfortable with my current portfolio and can see myself holding any of these companies for decades (that surely won't be the case, but I'm okay with that; not all of these will be good investments, but most of them should, I think).

My goal is not doing 50% in a year or buying low and selling high. My goal is to outperform the index modestly, at maybe 2-3% annually, which would compound very nicely over decades. I'm okay with the risk that I underperform at a modest rate. I want to avoid making drastic changes to my portfolio depending on macro environment.

I like stocks that are quality companies with:

-	A sustainable business model - high cash flow generation, high ROIC / ROCE, good balance sheet. Bonus points for recurring, diversified revenue, and optionality.
-	Business model and products I understand, or at least understand their value. I don't think I'll ever understand ASML's machines, but I understand why it's one of a kind company.
-	A wide moat. Bonus points are for brand value, network effect, IP, barriers to entry / high switching costs, supply chain, etc. I am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem. Almost every company I own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist.
-	High margins. I focus mostly on gross margin, but consider other margin metrics, too.
-	Sustainable buybacks and dividend growth.
-	Great management.

Not every company I own scores high in each of these, but together they fit my investment goals very well.

I used to have an allocation for growth in my portfolio, but overtime, I have decided to fully target quality companies and compounders with a great track record. I realized that it is never too late to buy into a company once it becomes profitable and sustainable. And if I miss a few 10-baggers because of restraint from unprofitable companies, I'll be okay with that.

My current allocation is 96% equity, with the rest being a single commodity holding - a carbon allowance ETF (CARB on BIT)

Of the 96% equity, 1/3 (32%) is in diversified ETFs:

| **MSCI EM IMI**          | 4,0%                  |

year,stocks,AMC says it will accept bitcoin as payment for movie tickets by year-end,"AMC Entertainment mentioned Monday it will begin accepting bitcoin as payment for movie tickets and concessions if bought on-line in any respect of its U.S. theaters. 

CEO Adam Aron mentioned throughout an earnings name Monday that the movie theater chain will have the IT methods in place to take the cryptocurrency as payment by the tip of 2021.

The transfer marks a wedding of two extremely speculative property — bitcoin, identified for its wild volatility, and AMC, which turned a meme inventory star favored by retail merchants on Reddit’s notorious WallStreetBets discussion board.

The value of bitcoin swung drastically in latest weeks, final buying and selling round $46,000 after falling under $30,000 final month. The latest rebound got here amid optimism {that a} cryptocurrency compromise will be included as a part of the bipartisan infrastructure bundle. The Senate finally didn’t advance the deal.

Tesla had introduced plans to allow bitcoin transactions, however it halted automotive purchases with the digital token in mid-Could as a consequence of considerations over how mining contributes to local weather change. CEO Elon Musk has since commented positively on bitcoin, saying he plans to carry the coin long run.

Shares of AMC climbed greater than 4% in prolonged buying and selling on Monday following a better-than-feared earnings report. The corporate posted a narrower-than-expected loss throughout the second quarter, together with income that topped analysts’ estimates.

The inventory has rallied practically 1,500% this 12 months as a band of retail merchants who coordinated trades on social media platforms managed to create a large brief squeeze within the shares.

year,stocks,New Investors: The average return of the stock market is 10% per year over time.,"2020 was an unprecedented year. New investors (of which there are tens of millions now) need to know that on average the return of the market is around 10% (it ranges from 7%-11% depending on your metric, but for simplicities sake we'll average it to 10%).

If you have gone beyond that 10%, that is a good thing, but it is not the average, and in the long term few investors beat the market as time goes on. Generally, beating the market is an anomaly and hard to replicate over 10 and 20 year periods.

I think as a whole investors have been spoiled by the last year. The market was so awash with cash (and continues to be) from FED action that a monkey could throw darts at a board and make a lot of money.

I make this post only to say that for newer investors, those who have been investing just in the last few years, don't be disappointed when your performance doesn't match that of 2020. As far as statistical returns show us, that was far and away an anomaly.

I think it's prudent to temper your expectations. I don't mean sell, I don't mean you won't beat the market in the future, I just mean to say temper your expectations so that you don't become disenchanted with investing as time goes on. If you beat 10% in your portfolio it is a GOOD thing. However, expecting 30%-500% growth in less than a year is only going to make you feel disappointed when your stocks don't meet that expectation.

year,stocks,10-year Treasury yield tops 4.2% for first time since 2008," 

Treasury yields rose again on Thursday, continuing to climb into territory not seen in more than a decade.

The benchmark [10-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y/) yield climbed 10 basis points 4.23%, at one point hitting 4.239% for its highest level since 2008. The yield on the policy-sensitive [2-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US2Y/) traded up five basis points to 4.608%.

Yields and prices move in opposite directions and one basis point equals 0.01%.

""I think 4% was reasonable,"" said Wells Fargo's Michael Schumacher. ""4.22% has become unanchored. We don't need the 10-year to act like a meme stock. That is not healthy.""

 

Many investors have been concerned about the economy contracting as the Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates to fight persistent inflation. Another 75 basis point hike is expected from the central bank at its next meeting on Nov. 1 and 2.

On Thursday, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said that the Fed would continue raising rates.

""Given our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation, I expect we will be well above 4% by the end of the year,"" Harker said.

The 10-year yield moved to new highs after Harker's remarks. Fed funds futures for next May crossed 5% for the first time on Thursday.

On the economic front, initial jobless claims came in at 214,000, below the 230,000 expected by economists according to Dow Jones. However, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index showed a larger than expected decline.

U.S. housing starts and building permits data for September came in below expectations on Wednesday, which investors widely understood as a sign of recession in the housing sector.

year,stocks,Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This Year,"Share prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.”***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

>>Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

year,stocks,USA Consumer Price Index for June 2022 year-on-year is 9.1%,"CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - JUNE 2022

The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.3 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 1.0 percent in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 9.1 percent before seasonal adjustment.

The increase was broad-based, with the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food being the largest contributors. The energy index rose 7.5 percent over the month and contributed nearly half of the all items increase, with the gasoline index rising 11.2 percent and the other major component indexes also rising. The food index rose 1.0 percent in June, as did the food at home index.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.7 percent in June, after increasing 0.6 percent in the preceding two months. While almost all major component indexes increased over the month, the largest contributors were the indexes for shelter, used cars and trucks, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, and new vehicles. The indexes for motor vehicle repair, apparel, household furnishings and operations, and recreation also increased in June. Among the few major component indexes to decline in June were lodging away from home and airline fares.

**The all items index increased 9.1 percent for the 12 months ending June, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1981.** The all items less food and energy index rose 5.9 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index rose 41.6 percent over the last year, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending April 1980. The food index increased 10.4 percent for the 12-months ending June, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending February 1981.

If you think Elon cares about Twitter's revenue, margins, growth, employee morale, you're crazy. He's treating Twitter like his little pet toy. He cares about Tesla and SpaceX, not Twitter. 

Despite all of this, Elon might still increase Twitter's stock price anyways because he could turn Twitter into a meme stock and his presence gives a huge amount of free publicity to Twitter.",0,"How can Elon be negative for a company that hasn't managed to figured out a business model (despite a huge user base) in over a decade and is basically a cesspool with rampant censorship?

stock price,stocks,How do companies make money from stock price?,"So I understand companies make money at IPO by selling a big chunk of stocks to a bank. And then the bank sells those shares to the public. But after that, stocks go to secondary market: I buy from you and you make money, the brokerage makes money. How does Apple make money because the stock price goes up? Does that mean companies own their own stock?",430,"They use it as collateral for loans. Or alternatively, they may pay other companies for acquisitions, buyouts etc with shares instead of cash. One recent example is the Nvidia - SoftBank deal for the acquisition of ARM",Usually it's by borrowing money against the stock price or by selling the stock they have on reserve.,"The company doesn't but the board and the executives (who make the decisions) do as they usually have a lot of stock and/or options.

The only way the company makes money off the stock price is if they do a secondary offering and issue more shares but that is only done by companies that really need the money not successful companies as this dilutes the shares and is bad for the shareholders (the board and the executives)."
stock price,stocks,Is Amazon's stock price too expensive?,"I have many conversations with individuals who say that amazon is too expensive for them to invest in. Obviously this is not related to the metrics of the company but rather the fact that they don't want to fork over 3300 for one share. 

I own multiple shares of the company because I believe in what amazon is and will be in the future, but all the discussions I have where people refuse to buy into the company makes me think that it loses many opportunities because of its price. 

It's been stated that Bezos is probably keeping from a stock split because he wants to keep frequent trading by retail investors away, but I believe it might lead to an increase in stock price. 

If the price was lower, say after a split, would you be more inclined to purchase the stock?

Edit: so people's perception on the stock based on this post are a) stock splits are stupid, everyone can do fractional shares b) not everyone can do fractional shares c) yes, it is expensive and therefore stupid to buy d) the stock is great, the price is undervalued and I wish I could buy more.",91,"I'd like to add that fractional shares are a lot like Instagram to boomers. They just don't do it, and even people I know in their early 30's refuse to buy a stock if its price is too expensive, even though they have the option of fractional shares.","In terms of value, I’d consider AMZN a great buy. The P/E has stayed within its long term range so it hasn’t bubbled like so many other stocks. Furthermore, it’s traded sideways for quite a while and will likely take a big leap in the not-too-distant future.

When the stock hits 4000 or 4500, questions of whether 3300 is expensive will be painful to reflect on.

Furthermore, the company has so much potential to grow. They’re in cloud, they’re in streaming. What’s next - Amazon banking? Amazon mortgages? I see London has an Amazon supermarket now - I personally believe they’ll be the largest company in the world in the next few years.

If you’re more reflecting on the cost per share, that shouldn’t matter with fractionals and is probably all the more reason to buy now. When they do eventually announce a split, you want to already be in.",I’d absolutely buy a ton of Amazon if it was lower.

IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

strategy,stocks,Warren Buffet's stock strategy is more relevant now than ever.,"Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to ""re-opening"" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:

If a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.

Contrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. 

Think of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.

Conversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?

The point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. 

My two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft ""growth"" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. 

Kohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.

Buy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.",2824,"Warren buffets portfolio is a freighter.

strategy,stocks,I Interviewed 20 Leading Wealth Management Firms: Here Are All Their Strategies,"I sold a company I created, and after the press release went out, I was inundated with very gracious offers to take and manage my new found money for fees. At the time, I presumed these wealth managers, after managing hundreds of millions - if not billions - of other people’s money for decades, would have developed advanced strategies and tactics for ensuring success. Surely, they would have teams of analysts scouring the markets for opportunities, technical indicators, news events, macroeconomic data and breakthrough innovations at all times to stay a step ahead of the pack. I was dead wrong.

What I discovered was an antiquated industry that relied heavily on the belief that they knew better and were on top of things. In fact, there was very little effort that went into managing OPM (other people’s money), and that most of the energy went to finding and onboarding new clients.

I’m not saying that their strategies were bad or didn’t work. I am only stating that they were neither complicated nor impressive. In short, anyone here could repeat the same strategies and save 1% of their money a year in perpetuity. Without further ado, here’s what I learned:

**Goldman Sachs**

It’s important to note that there are various divisions within GS wealth management that handle money differently. I break it down into low net worth, mid-net worth, and high net worth offerings. The low net worth folks are given Marcus, an automated investment system that simply relies on ETFs paired with some basic bond funds. It’s the same as buying Vanguard Target Retirement funds.

The mid-net worth offering is where I spent the bulk of time understanding. They find 30 stocks to invest in from different sectors with an attempt to represent the sector weighting of the S&P 500. As the SPX is largely tech, they are overweight technology. Basically, they take the SPY and cut it down from 500 companies to 30 companies.

Why would they offer a less diverse array of stocks?

They state as the reason that they are better able to manage 30 investments than 500, and since they are not trying to beat the returns of the index - their words - they’d rather find stocks with lower beta (volatility) and thus likely lower returns.

They locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within the S&P 500 once per quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments. They target a 6% annual return after accounting for their 1% fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over a certain amount of money invested with them.  This amounts to $10,000 per year for a $1M portfolio for many years - a lot of money to part with.

Did I mention, you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them, unless you happen to already own one of the 30 stocks they pick? So there are tax consequences of getting involved.

For the HNW folks, the above offering is available and they offer additional products, such as the ability to invest in private equity, REITs and hedge funds. As you might imagine, the more money they manage, the more “free” accounting services they include.

**Personal Capital**

This may actually be my favorite, given the simplicity of it. They take the main sector ETFs and eliminate any stocks that are losing money, to recreate their own ETFs by sector. They charge you a fee to use their ETFs.

They start with an equal amount of capital going to each sector ETF, but allocate more money to the sectors with the worst performance record from the year before. They do this annually. They do nothing all year.

They charge a fee for managing your money. I recall it being 25 or 35 basis points, but you have to also pay to use their ETFs so it creeps towards the better part of a percentage point very quickly and is much more expensive than simply buying a Vanguard S&P 500  fund or a group of the sector ETFs calling it quits.

**Ritholtz Wealth Management**

If you’ve watched CNBC regularly, you’d recognize the commentator Josh Brown - a partner of Ritholtz Wealth Management. He’s the one with the thick New York City accent. When I found out I may have the chance to have his insights managing my money, I was excited as he always seemed so knowledgeable. But the wealth management shop was not impressive.

In fact, their model was exactly the same as that of Goldman Sachs: they pick about 30 stocks, stick your money in them, rotate them every quarter, and keep volatility low on the stocks they pick. They target 5-6% annually, net of fees. Yes, you heard that correctly, 5-6%.

The next group of wealth management shops all fell into one of three other categories: SPY collars, ETF aggregators, or tactical investors

**SPY Collars**

This strategy involved putting all of your money into the SPY ETF then selling call options on that investment out of the money a few months out at a time. They take the income from the sale of these options and purchase out of the money puts on the SPY for similar expiration dates. This strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside. For those who are not used to options, here’s how it works.

Let’s say the SPY is trading at $400. You own it. You sell someone else the right to buy it from you for $440 for $40 per call. So long as the SPY stays under 440, the other person will not execute the call and you get to keep the money for the call premium. If the SPY goes above 440, you have to either sell your shares at $440 (plus pocket the $40 per call option premium, making this a sale at 480) or buy the call back at a higher price than what you sold it for. You’d lose money on the call, but the SPY shares have gained in value, so you still come out ahead. You are just not as ahead as you would be had you simply bought and held the SPY all the way to $490. This creates a ceiling in terms of the max amount you can obtain on the upside of your investment.

The option puts work the other way, protecting your investment on the way down. Since you used the premium collected on the sale of the call to buy the puts, you haven’t spent any new money but have bought yourself insurance. If the SPY drops, the value of your put option (a short on your own investment) increases. This increase offsets your losses, protecting you, especially in the case of extreme correction.

If the SPY rises, you lose the value of your put, so you have to account for that in your net income for the investment.

If you don’t follow this, don’t worry, the net effect is they use options to prevent a major loss but in doing so, they also prevent you from having any major gains. You are trapped or collared within an acceptable range of returns. Over time, you will not beat the S&P 500 index with this strategy and they say this.

So there is only value to this strategy if you simply are unwilling to trade a really bad year once in a while for a great year once in a while. It’s mostly about your investment time horizon and whether you need regular access to the money.

**ETF and Mutual Fund Aggregators**

About 7 firms I interviewed used this strategy. I heard the same thing so often, I thought maybe they were dumbing it down for me. Essentially, they just bought all sector ETFs or a basket of mutual funds for you. A few of the firms would use the collars I spoke of above if the market got a little choppy, but most did not.

This strategy was most common with smaller wealth management shops - under $250M AUM - which tried to differentiate themselves as financial planners that happen to look after your money. The bulk of them did very very little to watch the market and most flat out stated they only looked at these quarterly.

I could not understand what they did all day until one referred to himself as a market psychologist because his job was to calm clients down when the market shits itself. I have vodka for that, so this strategy was not for me.

**Tactical Firms**

These firms were harder to find and their DNA was more similar to day traders in terms of their mentality. They invested in a basket of stocks they thought represented a blend of value, growth, and good dividends. They chose them annually but were much more likely to liquidate and go to cash if they thought a correction was coming so they had cash to buy the dip.

One thing I did learn from them though was tax loss harvesting - a term for specifically taking losses on investments to offset gains on others.

The best way they did this was by rolling calls on equities that had risen in value. Imagine holding Apple stock and selling a call on it. If Apple goes up, you must then choose to sell the stock or buy the call back at a higher price for a loss. If you do the latter, in year 1 and sell a second option in year 2 at the same price or more than the call you bought back, you can write off the loss in year 1 while avoiding actual losses.

You can roll calls like this forever, amassing paper losses while you actually gain in the value of the underlying equity. It was a nice trick I’ve used many times now, especially when I want to sell something I’ve held for years with significant gains.

Their desire to protect the portfolio, I felt, prevented them from participating in the quick rebounds in the market. In 2019, when I spoke to them, they felt a crash was imminent and had gone to 60% cash in their portfolio. I never reached back out to see how they did, but I suspect they were buying the dips in March 2020.

Their overall returns were around 10% but not as good as simply buying the SPY and holding. But they did seem to be able to minimize the downside of some on major events.

**In the end, I never hired any of them.** I decided instead to use what I learned and what I knew and manage my own money. In case you read this far and are curious, yes, my returns have beaten all these firms’ average returns and I’ve actually learned a lot in the process. Sharing in case anyone could use the strategies.",4769,"One way to look at all these firms is that their primary job is not to make money, but to avoid losing it.  Their clients would be happier with lower returns if they can say that they have lower downside risk. 

Which is fair if I had a few million or more, I'd  be a lot less willing to yolo my entire life savings on the market if I did not know how it worked.  Great post and very informative!","Private wealth management firms don’t really help you investment your money in the sense that they have some “secret sauce” to beat the market. That is what investment managers are for. A private wealth firm should really be helping you with you estate goals not generating alpha.

strategy,stocks,Why simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing 3 decades of market data to find best DCA Strategy,"By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that

>Time in the market beats timing the market

But what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.

**Theoretically, there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hard-earned money once a month into SPY, right?**

So in this week’s analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!

___ 

**Analysis**

Given that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price & Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years \[1\].

Now we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)

**Average Joe:** Invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending (this would be our benchmark)

**Cautious Charlie:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio \[2\] is lesser than the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold Treasury-Bills \[3\]

**Balanced Barry:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio is within +20% \[4\] of the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold T-Bills

**Analyst Alan:** Invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last all-time high, else will hold T-Bills \[5\].

Given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it’s below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY. 

___

**Results**

Based on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.

**Return Comparison - Different DCA Strategies** 

|**Investment Strategy**|**Portfolio** |**Investment Strategy**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Joe|$169,036|406%|
|Analyst Alan - 1% drop|$168,129|403%|
|Analyst Alan - 3% drop|$166,658|399%|
|Balanced Barry|$162,150|385%|
|Analyst Alan - 5% drop|$154,441|362%|
|Analyst Alan - 10% drop|$146,392|388%|
|Cautious Charlie|$139,696|318%|

 

No matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high.

The least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.

___

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to the analysis.

a. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns

b. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute).

c. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years’ worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.

___ 

**Conclusion**

I started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames \[5,10, 20 years\] and various endpoints \[Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.\]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns.

Since this is an optimization problem, I am [sharing all the data and my analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JK4b-CYgvlSH-FqYvCBEve0RQ3ACmJNsmTwzLV7jqWs/edit?usp=sharing) in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive risk-adjusted market-beating returns.

___ 

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years.

\[2\] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis.

\[3\] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds

\[4\] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends

\[5\] The idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from JP Morgan which stated that 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones",1436,"How about Leveraged Larry who borrows an amount equal to future contributions, invests that money now, and gradually pays down the loan with what would have been the future contributions (a la the Lifecycle Investing book)?","nice job on this! now can you calculate gains for someone whose investment strategy consists of fomo buying and panic selling (only to rebuy for a loss when it goes back up, of course)

asking for a friend..","Hey. it's u/nobjos back with this week's analysis. Do let me know if you have any better strategies. Before you jump to comment about lump-sum investing having better returns, it assumes that you have enough money at the beginning of investing period to put in a lump sum amount (which is not the case for most of us) 

p.s: I do analyses like these every week. Recently, the analyses in Reddit were covered by [Graham Stephan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcldqSxfClU&t=111s&ab_channel=GrahamStephan) in his video."
strategy,stocks,Best investment strategy for 5-10 years?,"Hello I’m new to stocks, only have dealt with options a little and made money here and there. Looking to see if investing is my best option, hoping to save up enough money to buy acreage and start a homestead/farm in the future.

I figure it is better to invest some of my money in maybe the S&P 500 or similar ETF for 5-10 years and earn interest rather than leaving it in a bank.

Is this a smart idea or dumb? Looking to invest $100-200 a week.

Thank you for any advice.",110,How are you new to stocks but have experience with options? Thats like saying you’re new to math but have a degree in applied mathematics.,"Nothing is guaranteed.  A5 year time frame is a lot less guaranteed than a 10 year time frame.  In the short term we are ending a rate hiking cycled with immense debt and high inflation. Lots of market challenges.  You need to ask yourself what is your risk tolerance.  Lowest risk option is T bills.  You won't lose your money, and will make a basically guaranteed 5%.  Highest risk option is a 100% stock portfolio.  It's entirely possible to see a 40% drop in the short term that could take many years to recover from.  The longer you're at it, historically the 100% stock portfolio does pretty well....   something in the middle could be a 60/40 portfolio or an even more diversified portfolio like a golden butterfly.  Good luck out there, and I hope you reach your goals.",VOO
trading,stocks,This killed day trading for me..,"I haven't told hardly anyone this because it kills me to think about.  I had started day trading paper stocks. I was reading day trading books by reputable day traders, watching live YouTube traders and actually was doing pretty good. In 1 year, I had turned the original 10,000 paper money I started with into 140,000. It was like I couldn't lose. For every red day, I had 3 green days. I was doing everything by the book and it was really working.  
   
   So, not having any money, I took out a personal loan for 5k. Put 2k in the bank and 3k into my day trading platform. I was so confident in myself that i laughed when the loan guy told me 5 years at 23%. I told him I'd pay it off in full within 6 months. 

   Now in day trading they teach you to look for a catalyst. A reason why a stock will go up. They also teach you to set a stop loss at no more than 5% so you don't lose everything if it drops. Well I started day trading for real and was doing only ok. I would make 250 dollars then lose 150 dollars. Lose 300 then make 200. I was about 50/50 red days and green days. My 3k was down to about 2,800 after a week. Then it happened.  I read a stock twit at 5am about a small company that just had their product approved to sell on Amazon. I looked it up and it was true. I told myself I would buy 2k worth. When I looked up the price, it was only .88 a share!

   The bell rings and I buy like 2,200 shares. It instantly goes up about 6 percent and I'm getting excited. Then, literally as I'm setting my stop loss (not even 2 minutes into the session) it drops. Alot. Below where my stop was gonna be set. I'm down 100 so I'm like we'll shit. I go to set another stop but it falls so fast that I can't set it in time. I'm down 200 then 300 then 400 and I'm freaking out. I finally set a stop and it sells immediately for a 400 dollar loss. This was the first 5 minutes of the session. Over the next 20 minutes it dropped to .40 a share. I thought well at least I got out before it went that low. Upset and confused about why it would fall so low on positive news, I Ieft to work. I had about a 35 min drive and decided about 10 mins into it to check on that stock. It was 2.50 a share! The app for the particular platform at the time was only for checking stocks, I could not perform any buy/sell action from the app and I was driving to work. I checked again 10 mins later, it was at 4.50 a share! I got to the supply house about 20 mins later and checked while I was waiting on parts. 7.00 a share. I couldn't stop watching it all day so when the market closed and it was at 12.35 a share I literally felt sick. The next day it fell a bit early but then ended at 17 dollars! 

   Over the next two weeks it had massive swings but hit a high of 34 dollars a share. Now I don't know if I would have held it to that point but I beat myself up for months thinking I lost 400 dollars when I could have made 60k. It completely killed my spirit. I started sucking at my trades. It only took a few months and another almost 2k in losses for me to lose all motivation and pull out my 600 bucks I had left and put it in a different stock trading account, close my day trading account and completely lose all confidence in my ability to day trade.

   They say 84% of day traders claim a loss at the end of the year. I guess I was part of that statistic. I went from being on cloud 9 with my paper account for a year, just slaying the market to being completely shut down in just a few months. Every time someone brings up ""yo man, you still doing the day trading thing"" I just lie and tell them no I don't have enough time to dedicate to it anymore. But really I think of the perfect trade that I knew would go up, that I sold for a loss and, unable to do anything, I watched it go up 3,500% and it still makes me physically queasy. This was 4 years ago. I am what they call in the business an emotional trader. Just thinking of day trading for real money now actually gives me anxiety. Thanks for reading my story. 100% true btw. Nothing in this is made up or exaggerated. Real prices, real time frames. I just can't remember the ticker. 
 
   It ended up falling to about 3 or 4 dollars a share over the next year, and yes I watched it for the next year but 2k into 26k in one day would have been great. 2k into 35k the next day would have been better.  Turning it into 60k would have been life changing for me at that time but I think what hurts the most is that I found that obscure twit. I did the research. I truly believed it would go up, I knew it would go up. Then I panic sold my perfect trade that was truly perfect. Thats worse than losing the money.


EDIT: ok so I found the stock ticker!!!..I was able to log into my tc2000 account from my browser and look at my trade history. it was OBLN. I had trouble finding a chart for it for some reason but I did find one. The prices are totally different than what they were that day. They must have had some splits or reverse splits or something. 

   I also got a couple details wrong. I didn't buy 2,000 shares. That was actually a different stock. I yolo'd my whole 3,000 dollars and bought 3,448 shares at .87 each on May 23, 2019. Another detail I got wrong, It wasn't almost 4 years ago it was almost 3 years ago. I sold 2 minutes later at .57 a share. It wasn't a 400 dollar loss, it was a 600 dollar loss. According to the only chart I could find that recognized the ticker symbol, on May 23, 2019 it opened at 20.40, hit a high of 28.20, a low of 18.90 and closed at 20.40 a share, exactly the same as the open. Totally different than what my trade history says. There are some other weird things about this stock besides having trouble finding a chart. On tc2000 it is now listed as OBLN.OLD Also, my trade history is wonky and not correct. I bought all those shares, watched it drop and sold them. Then watched the price skyrocket for the rest of the day. According to Tc2000, I bought 3,448 shares at .87 which is correct but then it says I sold them all 2 minutes later for .84. This is not correct. It also shows me buying 4,000 shares the next day at .57, then selling 3,000 21 minutes later for .55 then selling the other 1,000 17 minutes after that for .57. None of that happened. I never traded it a second day. I bought at .87 then sold a few minutes later at either .55 or .57. It was one transaction on one day. Tc2000 was always a little funky and I grew to not like it all. I'm sure since the chart and my numbers do not match there will still be people saying I'm lying or this is fake or whatever. If those people would like, I can send them screen shots of my buy at .87 on the same day that the chart says it was 20.40. I wish it matched but I currently have both up on my computer and I can send them. I don't understand it either. But I found the ticker!!! Yea!",2007,Biggest mistake was trading money that wasn't yours. That makes your trades much more emotional.,Stocktwits is manipulative pump garbage. Stay off of there and find another source of leads.,"If you sold at the top and netted 60k it probably would have stoked your confidence and made you more comfortable taking on even riskier behavior and exposing yourself to even greater downsides.  Just some food for thought.  Lack of sustainability is a key feature of day trading.

Trading in dozens of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange was briefly halted shortly after the market opened on Tuesday due to an apparent technical issue.

The major stocks impacted included Morgan Stanley, Verizon, AT&T, Nike and McDonald’s, according to the NYSE’s website. Many stocks were shown to have abnormally large moves when the market opened, which may have triggered volatility halts.

CNBC’s Bob Pisani said on “Squawk on the Street” that the issue appears to be a technical one and not something that happened on the trading floor.

Many of the companies impacted resumed trading before 9:45 a.m. ET. The NYSE said at roughly 9:50 a.m. that all of its systems were operational.",1098,"I love how there is no actual explanation, just ‘technical issue’ lol",Are you just out of luck if your stops got raided by this?,"It was me.

I get the average investor just auto-deposits in their 401(k), but I want to instantly get answers like:

- What is the proportion of mid-cap value stocks in my portfolio? (Vanguard tries but excludes all the foreign stocks)
- What would an identical investment schedule (same amounts, same dates) in VTI/SPY/AAPL from this date to that date have yielded compared to what I achieved?
- What is the internal rate of return of my portfolio? Or overall beta? Standard deviation? Modified Dietz return? Time weighted return?
- Give me every single transaction going back farther than 18 months
- How much in dividends did I earn from this specific ticker since [insert date], and how much have they compounded
- How many dollars of my portfolio is invested in [country]

underlying stock price,stocks,"Tesla Stock booms with $32,000 starting price for model 3 after tax credit","All of the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 vehicle trims are now eligible for the full tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Internal Revenue Service verified Tuesday. While it remains unclear how the global EV giant accomplished the feat, the Model 3 now has a starting price of around $32,000. TSLA stock jumped Wednesday.

**Tesla stock advanced 1.6% to 224.83 Wednesday during market trade with Tesla Model 3 vehicles going for as low as $30,330 on the company's website.** 

Tesla is officially saying the Model 3 starts at $32,740 after the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Meanwhile, reports circulated early Wednesday that Tesla has agreed in principle with a plan to set up a manufacturing plant in India. Tesla's website recently stated that the base Model 3 vehicle was eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit under the IRA. The model previously only qualified at the $3,750 level. Tesla has not disclosed how it brought the Model 3 into alignment with IRA requirements for the full tax credit. Meanwhile, the IRS made the official change to its site Tuesday morning. It announced all Model 3 and Model Y vehicles qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.

# Model 3 Tax Credit Doubles

The Biden administration said on March 31 that vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit must have batteries with specific quantities of components manufactured in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain countries.

Vehicles that meet only one of the critical minerals or battery components requirements are eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. At the time, the base rear-wheel-drive Model 3, with its battery from China, did not qualify for the full tax credit. 

**Tesla stock shrugged off early losses and climbed 1.7% to 221.31 Tuesday. It turned higher just after the IRS confirmed the Model 3 eligibility. TSLA has gained in the past seven sessions. It has gained 117% since early January lows of 101.81.**

# The Eligibility Switch

Late Monday, Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas wrote the qualification change ""implies that Tesla likely tweaked its supply chain to meet both requirements.

""Tesla has used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China's CATL for the base Model 3. CATL commented Monday that rumors Tesla has ended their relationship are untrue and there is no change in the strategic partnership. 

Jonas told investors Tesla may have switched to manufacturing Model 3 battery packs in the U.S. while still using China-made battery cells. The analysts also floated the idea that, with Shanghai Tesla exporting to Canada, it could be freeing up U.S. battery production for local deliveries. 

Or, Jonas said, it simply could be ""regulatory semantics."" Under guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury, EV manufacturers can average the qualifying critical mineral content used over a limited period of time. Jonas said this language means Tesla could produce enough qualifying Model 3 batteries at its Fremont plant to offset the Model 3 rear-wheel drive trim's China-made battery.",465,"1.6% is a ""boom"" now?",*Dies in £60k price in UK* ($70K),Used Teslas on craigslist take note.
underlying stock price,stocks,Facebook/Meta price move shows that no individual stock is 100% safe,"It's a lesson that everyone who invests in individual stocks should keep at the back of his mind. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook have been praised on here for many years as stocks that will  outperform the overall market with relative safety.

Thanks in advance",20,Yes. That’s the point,"SCHD has outperformed VTI because the underlying stocks have outperformed. 

Why?

Well, value doesn't mean it won't grow, and growth doesn't mean it will. Growth typically just means more of the current price is based on future growth expectations and future earning potential, rather than present earning potential. But most of that growth is priced in, so if they perform any worse than expected, even if they still grow significantly, the stock is likely to go down. Similarly, a ""value stock"" trading at 10x cash flow can repurchase 10% of their shares per year, thus the stock price would increase 10% per year if the market cap stays constant, leading to outperformance. 

This is why I hate the growth and value stocks labels. Newbies assume that cause it's called growth, it's a better long term investment and bound to outperform long term. All good investing is value investing. And that doesn't mean just buying ""value stocks"" - ""growth stocks"" can be undervalued too.","In an efficient market with a large enough ETF yes.

ETFs have a creation and redemption mechanism that keeps the value of the ETF and the underlying basket at the same value.

For VTI specifically, yes it will be a fair price 

If you go to ETF.com/ETF SYMBOL on the page they will show the history of the ETFs price relative to the basket. A price sold higher than the basket is a premium and below is a discount.

This will give you an indication of how fair the etf is on average historically

Now that you understand the holdings dictate the value, then yes better ETFs will occur because the underlying holding did better in the period reviewed"
time,stocks,Tesla cuts U.S. prices for fifth time since January.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/tesla-cuts-us-prices-for-fifth-time-since-january.html

Tesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Tesla’s largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.

Some analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year. Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11% since the start of the year, with a 20% reduction on its base Model Y.",2383,Overpriced to begin with now you can see the profit margin.,"Quick, time to do something funny with twitter!","I'm looking forward to the figures to see if the cuts are lowering their profit margin.

Do they lower prices too to try and compete, making an even bigger loss or rely on their own brand loyalty for people to pay their asking price to minimise their losses. 

Must be hard for the likes of Ford and VW who are making good decisions and relatively close to being profitable on EVs  just to see Tesla lower prices whenever it suits them to put the pressure on."

\------the article------------------------------------------

(Bloomberg) -- Russia defaulted on its foreign-currency sovereign debt for the first time in a century, the culmination of ever-tougher Western sanctions that shut down payment routes to overseas creditors.  

For months, the country found paths around the penalties imposed after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. But at the end of the day on Sunday, the grace period on about $100 million of snared interest payments due May 27 expired, a deadline considered an event of default if missed.

With the final deadline passed, focus shifts to what investors do next.

They don’t need to act immediately, and may choose to monitor the progress of the war in the hope that sanctions are eventually softened. Time may be on their side: the claims only become void three years on from the payment date, according to the bond documents. 

“Most bondholders will keep the wait-and-see approach,” Takahide Kiuchi, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo.

“It’s a very, very rare thing, where a government that otherwise has the means is forced by an external government into default,” said Hassan Malik, senior sovereign analyst at Loomis Sayles & Company LP. “It’s going to be one of the big watershed defaults in history.”

time,stocks,Gasoline prices top $5 a gallon nationally for the first time and are likely headed higher,"The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose above $5 nationally for the first time due to increased demand from the economy reopening from the pandemic and depleted oil supplies stemming in part from the war in Ukraine.

Prices look set to continue rising into the summer months, analysts said.

the average national price reached $5.004 on Saturday. That’s up from about $3.07 a year ago and a record price not adjusted for inflation. At the end of the week, prices had already averaged $5 or more in about 20 states, with the highest prices on the West Coast.

“By my calculations, the typical household is spending about $160 more on gas a month than a year ago,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “That’s a big bite.”

Gasoline prices normally peak in mid-May, but this year they have continued to rise and the average price is about 65 cents higher than a month ago. Due to short supplies this year, analysts are forecasting that prices may not top out until mid-July, when summer driving season traditionally peaks.

“I don’t think we’re far away” from the highest prices, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “I don’t think it would eclipse $5.50. I would say $5.25 is the top, but again, the market is unhinged.”

However, if there are any serious refinery outages this summer, or disruptions from hurricanes, gasoline prices could spike, he added.

Gasoline is in shorter supply than normal because the U.S. has lost about 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity, since before the pandemic. At the same time, sanctions on Russian energy has sent oil prices sharply higher and created tight supplies of both oil and fuel globally.

Analysts say while consumers are feeling pain at the pump, the price of fueling a car with gasoline is not as big a part of a household’s spending as it had been in the past. That is in part due to more efficient vehicles.

According to a CNBC analysis, drivers were spending an estimated average 20 cents per mile on gasoline as of June this year, even with the steep price increases. In 1980, that same mile would have cost 30 cents in today’s dollars.",6817,I just paid $10.15 for gallon here in Europe today these gas prices really suck,"Guys, just don’t drive. Problem solved.

time,stocks,Oil stocks - the time is now,"Hello there

I posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they’ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings). Hope you hopped on. Now I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges

There are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:

* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU’s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range
* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)
* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)
* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)
* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down

Which all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes’ rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:

* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th
* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter
* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st
* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th 
* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.
* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring

The last several EIA reports have been good in general – drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. 

What’s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over and it seems we're about halfway recovered. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving

Right now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth’s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well

Worried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it’s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It’s weird that big tech has been climbing – companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a ‘tax bill fear’ from the Dem’s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven’t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors. Environmental regulations should be, however

However, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)

What am I looking at in particular?

Right now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX>VLO>MPC at this point for value.

* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61
* VLO target price: ~$71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50

From a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it’s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It’s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I’m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it’s at the low of the range it’s been confined in and wouldn’t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren’t bad pickups either

PS – stay away from OXY. It’s very clear they’re going to continue to issue shares until they’re through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved. It was popular for a while, not sure how it’s still viewed, just stay away

TLDR; buy refineries and the producers worth buying that aren't drowning in debt or have terrible assets

Disclosure: I have a large position in PSX calls",2173,I traded oil for too many years (mostly unsuccessful).   Just remember it always does the opposite of what you think it's going to do.  It's ran and manipulated by OPEC a literal cartel.  You think the price is going down?  Next day Nigerian rebels come to blow up a pipeline and create a shortage.  You think the price is going up because of demand?  Nope because we just turned on 50 rigs to pump more.  It's an endless game and very hard to make consistent gains.  Oil does not trade like any other sector.  Be careful out there and best of luck!,It’s crazy how a well thought out post like this gets nothing but hate on this sub but some dude posting “should I buy Tesla at $2100?” will get hundreds of upvotes and two dozen comments saying “yea bro solid long term hold time in beats timing”,[deleted]
stock market crash,stocks,Ok so you think a Market Crash is coming. Paint a picture of how it happens and the near term fallout.,"With so many crosswinds, it's hard not to imagine that a market crash is possible. I'm curious what this crash would actually look like for the market and the US economy. How long would it take to really take hold? What could day-to-day life look like for Americans? How long could it last? How much pain is possible?",0,"No one knows obviously, but I think it's a scenario similar to September 2021. QQQ to $330 and bounce. The market doesn't really have anything left to rally on at the moment, in my opinion.","powell fails to contain inflation bc it is structural due to demographics and the real estate cycle and underinvestment in commodities, he eventually is forced to pivot or pause due to treasury market dysfunction (the one thing that could be more important than the dual mandate), inflation roars but S&P doesn’t crash in nominal terms but instead climbs while slowly going down in inflation adjusted terms. But the general public might not necessarily notice bc it lives in a nominal dollar world.

Either that or commercial real estate or Bank of Japan cause a quick crash that can be recovered from through the slashing of interest rates.

I have no idea how likely either scenario is or if they are even the most likely bear cases but that is what I can think of.","Not a crash.  A drawn-out bear.

First, the zombie companies start failing because their business models are broken.  This causes layoffs. Then the viable, but over-leveraged companies start to fail as their low-interest debt matures at significantly higher rates.  More layoffs.

Then, consumers start realizing that eating and paying the mortgage are more important than shelling out for a $1,200 phone or $40K - $75K for an EV.  The Magnificent 7 earnings start to fall.  More layoffs.

Then laid-off workers stop making rent/mortgage and car payments. Cars are repossessed.  Tenants are evicted. Mortgages are foreclosed. Layoffs at car dealerships, management companies, and real estate brokerages.

Multigenerational or blended families sharing a single house or apartment become common. Taking in boarders to make ends meet becomes common for families with spare bedrooms. A single car shared among multiple adults becomes common. Maybe no car if most work from home.

Laid-off family members provide child care, cooking, and cleaning services for room and board. Layoffs at daycares, restaurants, and maid agencies.

The economy, which is 70% consumer spending, shrinks. Debts are defaulted on.  Collateral gets marked to market.  Asset prices fall.

Or, if too many banks are in jeopardy, the Fed steps in.

The Fed takes mortgages that are in default and swaps them for US Treasuries at book value. Same for auto loans in default. No collateral is marked to market.  The price of the average US single-family home increases to $2 million. The price of the average car to $100,000.

Interest rates are lowered to zero so that the laid-off workers can still buy iPhones. (Heck, maybe negative to create a huge incentive to spend.)  People start taking out loans to finance their (over-) consumption, hoping for the eventual debt jubilee.

Maybe Congress authorizes another round of fiscal stimulus.

The economy picks up again. The S&P500 hits 7,000, but it might as well be called the S&P7 with also-rans."
stock market crash,stocks,"Too many of you have never experienced a stock market crash, and it shows.","I recently published my portfolio for 2022, and caught some grief for having 27% of my money allocated for cash, cash equivalents, and bonds.  Heck, I'm 58, so that was pretty appropriate.

But something occurred to me, I am willing to bet many of you barely remember 2008, probably don't remember 2000-2002, and weren't even alive for 1987.  If you are insisting on a 100% all-equity portfolio, feel free. But, the question is whether you have a plan when the market takes a 50% toilet dump? What will you do?

Took ALL my gains and some principal investment. But never sold and bought more. Scary times though.

What I learned was the importance of not having debt (or very little). Have a lot of debt and hard economy conditions can be a death blow to your financial well-being. Sure I could pull equity our of my homes and invest more capital. But the peace of mind feels too good. 

It's pretty hard to go bankrupt when you don't have debt."
stock market crash,stocks,Are we on the verge of another crash?,"There weren't that many positive earnings even. Microsoft had bad guidance and Apple had declining sales. Moody downgraded a bunch of banks. BlackRock CEO also just sold 7% of his shares again.

The ones that are solid solid like P&G, J&J, etc. are going sideways. How is the S&P 500 still near the all time high? 

This doesn't seem right. Who in their right mind think it's good to have another crash? Can you imagine some of the companies I listed go lower? I can't imagine the tech companies that are 1/10th of their high.

# The Technicals

2022's first half was the worst half to a stock market year in the last 52 years. This saw the S&P 500 move down from 4,818.62 to 3,636.87. This is a range of 1,181.75. Of this range, an ideal fibonacci retracement (bear market short-term rally) would be 61.8% back up in this range. That takes us 730.32 up from 3,636.87 which gives 4,367.19. Yesterday's high was 4,325.28. This high was within 1% error of the ideal 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.

Thus, the 50 Week Simple Moving Average of the S&P500, as a further catalyst for resistance, will reject the S&P500 down, thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue.

That said, the first half of 2022 was the worst in 52 years, the third quarter was one of the best, and the fourth quarter may end up being the worst stock market quarter on record. Here is a visual:

# 1929-crash-like Margin Deleveraging

[FINRA Margin Statistics](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) has been updated to include July. As expected, we got a slight reprieve in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. Nevertheless, graphing the data and adjusting for the near-record inflation for each data point, we can see that we are still in the worst bubble by value in the history of the stock market.

Fibonacci of this graph shows that Margin has to collapse up to $370 Billion more from August's expected margin value), depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging.

FINRA Margin Totals, Adjusted for Month-by-Month Inflation. Dotcom crash (left bubble), 2008-2009 crash and great recession (middle bubble) and the current bubble (right). Fibonacci retracement values are listed for 61.8% and 78.6% of each deleveraging period. One can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range, depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding. (61.8% seems to correspond to slow and weak, and 78.6% seems to correspond to fast and strong). The data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

Unfortunately, summer is ending. The short-term rally has expired, as technicals show three problems for the stock market: 1: A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 50 week Simple Moving Average, 2. The 61.8% retracement already happened, and 3. A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 200 day Simple Moving Average. In a 1929-like scenario, total margin (and adjusted for inflation) shows that we are still in the largest margin bubble of all time. Fibonacci levels on the inflation-adjusted FINRA margin data show that the market has to still undergo up to $370 Billion of deleveraging. Therefore, I am hereby predicting that the fall and winter months of 2022 will be some of the worst months in stock market history. Leading market strategists such as Dimon, Zuckerberg, Musk, Novogratz, and even Warren Buffett concur, and some say that 2023 will be a Depression. Will 2022's crash lead us into 'the greatest depression,' and do you think Warren Buffett will die \[either because of or\] during this crash/depression? Please provide your thoughts and comments below.",83,"Fuck yea I love reading threads where random people on the internet claim things like ""unprecedented bull run"" or ""greatest depression"" are going to happen",You lost all credibility when you cited Mark Zuckerberg.,"What in the holy hell did you fucking smoke today? 

You're cherry-picking bear sentiments and technicals, and concluding the absolute WORST scenario from those. I am both confused and fucking impressed."

stock market crash,stocks,Buffet's stock market indicator is signalling an imminent crash,"Hello everyone, it is my first post here so please go easy on me.

Came across an article today on Business Insider Singapore that the Buffet Indicator divides the total value of publicly trading stocks by quarterly GDP. At this point in time, it has climbed to a record high and it is used to gauge whether the stock market is overvalued or undervalued.

Examples, it surged to 118% before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 a, and topped 100% before the 2008 financial crisis.

It now sits at 179%, question is, can we rely on this measure? Looking forward to hearing from the community.

That said, I'm looking at the P/E of my stocks and avoiding anything that looks too inflated.","I've seen this and don't pretend to know more than Warren Buffett, but isn't this chart reflective of:

A sudden, shocking exogenous event with a likely end date.  Like a hailstorm hitting a farm and battering a season's crop, the farm isn't suddenly worth 50% or more less than before.

The death of small business, even before the pandemic, and accelerated by it.  More of the economy/GDP than in the past is concentrated in large, publicly traded companies."

options,stocks,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

Hope this was helpful, let me know what ya think!!",1862,So one of the main reasons to trade options is to be given the opportunity to trade with leverage?,"Great post by the OP. One aspect he did not touch on is the fact that all the pieces that go into the value of an option act like exponential curves. Why is this important to understand?

Let's start with theta (or time value). Theta decay is not linear. If we compare an April and July option of the same strike, the value of the option will drop more tomorrow in the April option than it will in the July option. In fact, there is virtually no theta decay in the July option right now. Theta decay really becomes important to consider 30 days before expiration.

In my trading, I prefer to trade in options 60-90 days out. It will cost me more to own that theta but it also gives me the chance to change my mind in the first few weeks without losing theta value. This is a more conservative approach. I use options to generate small incremental returns or to add some profit opportunity to core positions when I think a news item might move the stock sharply.

The next variable to consider is called **delta**.  This variable measures the rate of change expected in the option relative to the underlying stock price. If I buy a $100 strike call on a stock trading at $120, the option should rise $1 for each $1 rise in the stock.  This is called delta 1 in the industry, the one is shorthand for 1.0 or 100% - the option price change will reflect 100% of the stock price change. ""Delta 20"" means 20%. Optimally, you want an option that goes from delta 20 or 30 to delta 1 with 20-30 days left before expiration. You get the benefit of the share price move AND preserve some theta value you can re-capture in the sale.  Unfortunately, there are no freely available tools that will tell you the delta of a particular option. Without them, you have to just feel it out but a good rule of thumb is a 30% differential is roughly delta 30 and a 40%+ differential is probably delta 10 (i.e. the option is not going to budge much even if the stock moves 10%).

You will get the most out of an option if you can play those periods where the delta is increasing rapidly. Take that $100 stock again. Let's buy a call option with a $130 strike price. If the stock goes to $101, the option will not move much. As the stock rises more, the option will react more. This is how you can make a very high rate of return on options. That 30% strike premium will make the option quite cheap, maybe a $1 depending on the other variable. If the stock gets to $120, that option is probably close to $3, triple your money.

The last important variable is **vol**, short for volatility. A stock that has large, frequent swings is more likely to hit any given strike price than a slow-moving stock. Traders price the options differently as a result. In bull markets, general stock market vol declines which generally means that individual stock vol declines as well on average. But if markets start behaving dramatically, stock option values increase as this vol becomes more valuable. This is why having some puts in your portfolio after strong bull markets might make sense. Puts increase in prices as stocks fall AND as vol increases. It's a double payday.

The value of an option is largely the sum of these three variables. Theta is a cost you have to just accept. The higher the delta in an option, the less risk you have of losing everything at the cost of much-reduced upside. Since changes in vol are very hard to predict, it is really just a bonus if you catch it.",PSA. This post is missing a lot of key pieces to options trading.

options,stocks,Could Elon Musk in effect bankrupt himself if he loses the Tesla Options case and gets Margin called?,"Elon Musk has $150 Billion in Margin loans and he is being sued over $55 Billion of his Tesla options. I've seen articles saying pre split Tesla falling to $570 could trigger a Margin Call for Musk. I can't find any new articles about Elon margin call post split but I've seen on Reddit that if Tesla falls to $120-$130 post split Musk will be margin called.  If the Judge in the options case rules Musk unduly influenced the board to grant him that $55 Billion Tesla options package by being a controlling shareholder and forces him to give up that $55 Billion in Tesla shares while simultaneously Tesla falls below $120 ( which it is dangerously close to) will Musk effectively bankrupt himself? The previous greatest destruction of wealth in Modern History was Masayoshi Son losing $70 billion in the Dot Com Crash, his only saving grace being a $20 million investment in Ali Baba that swelled to $100 Billion. Do we have a front row seat to the great wealth destruction in history ($100 Billion or over)?",1889,">$150 Billion in Margin loans

I'd have to do some digging to find the specifics, but just know the actual $ value of the debt is not $150B, the collateral for the loans is worth (or was worth) $150B.  E.g., he previously had a margin facility laid out for his Twitter acquisition.  It had an initial LTV of 20% or $.20 of credit for every $1 of tesla shares pledged.  Similarly, the margin call threshold was at 35% LTV, which isn't as risky as our typical conception of a margin call.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  No.  The banks that made these loan facilities were generally cognizant of the concentration risk and volatility of Tesla as collateral, the dollar value of the loans is small, and Musk still has significant equity at the margin call threshold(s).",Not really. I'm sure Elon has significant assets that are protected from bankruptcy.

options,stocks,"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. 

Last year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades & Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",7844,And you started with? 600k?,"great post but an important question seems how much you started with?

market,stocks,Amazon Becomes World’s First Public Company to Lose $1 Trillion in Market Value,"Amazon.com Inc. is the world’s first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year. 

Shares in the e-commerce and cloud company fell 4.3% on Wednesday, pushing its market value to about $879 billion from a record close at $1.88 trillion on July 2021. Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. 

While technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year. 
The e-commerce giant has shed $1 trillion in market value
  
The world’s largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre-pandemic habits. Its shares have fallen almost 50% amid slowing sales, soaring costs and a jump in interest rates. Since the start of the year, co-founder Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune dwindle by about $83 billion to $109 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Last month, Amazon projected the slowest revenue growth for a holiday quarter in the company’s history as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty. That sent its market value below $1 trillion for the first time since the pandemic-fueled rally in tech stocks more than two years ago.",1943,So reversed the pandemic rally?,What the absolute… I bet they rally in the end…,It's all imaginary value so no biggie
market,stocks,"Can't make sense of this market, so I'm still doing nothing","I don't know what the f- is going on anymore.  Here's what's running around my head at the moment:

1. Markets sold off before the election on the apparent theory that it was looking to be close/contested and the markets don't like uncertainty.
2. Markets rebounded in the days leading up to the election as it started looking better for a clear Biden win.
3. Election is incredibly close and contested, government will likely be split, and yet the markets are rallying super hard.  The prevailing theory is that a Biden win with Republican senate will make it less likely that Biden will attack big tech and increase taxes.
4. In spite of (3), a split government will also make it more difficult to pass a stimulus package, which increases the likelihood of a double-dip recession.
5. COVID still spiking but nobody seems to care anymore, which makes it more powerful as a potential risk.  If the numbers keep spiking, eventually that will lead to one of two headlines that people really won't like: hospitals getting overwhelmed and/or increasing lockdowns.  The latter will be much more likely to happen under Biden than Trump.
6. The rally today seems broader but there were some real breadth concerns yesterday.  Breadth indicators, like the TICK and NYAD, were flat yesterday.  This suggests the rally is being driven primarily by a certain segment of the market (big tech) and not an ""everything is great, pile into the markets"" sentiment.
7. The ridiculously sharp rally over the past few days has made it extremely difficult to find good entry points on anything.  Stocks have gone from pullback to mega-overbought in 3 days.  Major indices are more extended beyond their 8-day EMAs than since late Nov 2018, shortly before the markets plummeted to major lows.
8. I've learned several valuable lessons over my years of investing that all seem to be coming into conflict right now: i) Time in the market is better than timing the market; ii) Think long term and focus on weekly charts; iii) Don't make emotional, reactionary decisions; iv) Don't get caught up in FOMO; v) Don't invest based on what you think the market will do, or what you want it to do, but on what it's actually doing.

market,stocks,Some words of advice for those who are entering stock market for the first time.,"If you are a first time investor, especially a young investor, it is very easy to fall in the trap of buying the stock that your friend, relative, or a stranger on internet recommended. Just because someone made 1000% gains on something doesn't mean you are going to make that.

Remember, that the faster any asset climbs up the faster it comes down like a house of cards. If it had no resistance going up, there is no support going down and when such stocks crack, they fall through the roof in a matter of hours, not even days.

Nowadays, you get ads on YouTube every 2 seconds with someone shouting in your face with so called their magic formula where their students make $500-$2000 every trade. Don't fall for these snake oil salesman. If making money were that easy, nobody would work their ass off for years just to buy a house or a car.

Pick up a book and learn the basics of Finance. Fundamentals will help you get a handle of how to start valuing a company. While Technical charts play a role in short to medium term movements of the stock, long term is always going to be based on Fundamentals. Watch Peter Lynch's videos on YouTube, he is an old school investor just like Warren Buffett, but has some really good food for thoughts in his videos.

Needless to say, if you are investing in Crpto be extremely conservative. 10% of your portfolio is too much. Anything more than that, and you lose your hard earned savings very quickly if things go south.

I understand there is a Euphoria when you make quick money, but derivatives like Futures and Options are sure shot way of getting screwed if you don't know what you are doing. Everyone has an itch to make a lot of money in a short period of time, but trust me, losing your original investment is one the worst feeling you can ever have if you earned that money by working hard.

If you don't know anything at all about investing and want to start putting some money into an investment account, buy a broad market based ETF like SPY or QQQ on a regular basis. Think $100-$200-$500/month. Time in the market is always going to beat timing the market.

Lastly, as Warren Buffett said - Rule 1: Never lose money and Rule 2: Never forget Rule 1.

TL;DR: Don't invest blindly in Stocks that some friend/stranger recommended you. Efforts to make money quickly on Stocks, Crpto, or Derivatives (Futures and Options) without understanding the fundamentals and risks, will make you lose your hard earned money and your shirt. If you don't know anything about investing, buy broad market based ETF like SPY and QQQ on a regular basis.",936,"Very well written and important advise for those starting out in the markets.

Calculate the intrinsic values of the companies then come up with dream prices that will give you fantastic returns.  Wait.  During the crash use limit orders to capture an extreme inter day price.  Maybe you get lucky with a few of the companies.  The stocks you do buy are good for above average returns for at least a few years, and maybe they turn into long term holds."

Likewise, after the midterms in the second year of a president's term we tend to do well in the stock market. The reasoning behind this is because the stock market likes to have certainty on what policies will be approved or denied in the future. Will I be buying during this false bounce?

20% of portfolio will be in SCHD - this is another good ETF that is good for growth and has an excellent 3.73%. 

10% of portfolio will be in GOOG - It's google, need I say more? 

10% of portfolio will be in TSLA - It's Tesla. They are the future. 

8% of portfolio will be in METV - This is a Metaverse ETF. 

8% of portfolio will be in SOFI - The future of banking. Millenials and Gen Z love this company. 

7% of portfolio will be in TQQQ at the start of the rally, and will be swung trade every few days to make a profit. 

2% of portfolio will be in CCL - I see Carnival Corporation doing well long term. In fact I almost want to buy and hold some after this recent sell off a few days ago.

price,stocks,Ford CEO Jim Farley says Tesla price cuts could start an EV price war,"https://news.yahoo.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-says-110356902.html

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.

At a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla's attempts to increase sales were ""completely rational and should surprise no one.""

Elon Musk's company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla's entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.

In January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.

""Price wars are breaking out everywhere,"" Farley said. Who's going to blink for growth?""

Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.

On Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv. But its profits took a hit as net income plummeted 24% year-on-year to $2.51 billion during the three months ending March 31.

Seth Goldstein, an equities strategist for Morningstar, told Insider Tesla's price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling. He said Ford, which previously predicted its EV business would keep losing money until at least 2026, was faced with the ""potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more.""

""That makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond,"" Goldstein said.

Farley said at the Detroit event that Ford would focus on areas where there was less competition, such as pickup trucks and vans, Reuters reported.

Tesla is implementing significant price reductions for its vehicles in China, following a substantial 31% drop in sales for July from the previous month. To counter the downturn in the world's largest automotive market, Tesla has trimmed the starting prices of its China-made Model Y long-range and performance models by 14,000 yuan (around $1,900), a reduction of 4.5% and 3.8% respectively. Additionally, the automaker will offer insurance subsidies of 8,000 yuan for entry-level, real-wheel-drive versions of Model 3 cars, available between Aug. 14 and Sept. 30.  
  
The move comes amidst a broader global decrease in demand for electric vehicles, and local competitors such as BYD regaining market share with more favorable pricing. Sales of Tesla’s China-made cars have been on a decline since the end of 2022, although the automaker did see a 31% year-over-year increase in sales in China in February 2023.  
  
Despite the decline in China, Tesla's global vehicle deliveries in Q2 2023 hit a record high of 466,100 units, a quarter-over-quarter increase of about 10.23%.

price,stocks,How would you target price META?,"I got it at $92 (50 stocks) and I'm thinking how long the upwards tick can last. Some things I'm weighing in

Positives

1. TikTok has impeding ban US-wide and possibly Europe
2. VR is growing and they are heavily vested in it, at the moment almost monopoly
3. It is still printing money despite massive VR investment
4. Instagram is very much alive 

Negatives

1. Apple VR intro imminent next week, could crater Meta depending on what Apple reveals
2. Facebook is essentially a dead platform among zoomers and younger
3. As a VR enthusiast they are not exactly performing on their ecosystem especially Horizon Worlds development

My target is $350 but the soon upcoming Apple WWDC is making me uncomfortable.",15,"I did pretty similar to you, bought 50 shares when meta was around 90 but I sold at 260. Was always a short term play for me though, I’d rather hold the nasdaq than shares of meta now that they’ve recovered from their absurdly low valuation.

Hindsight and all but I wish I would have put much more into meta. Meta at $90 and a p/e of 13 was probably one of the biggest opportunities I’ve seen in a long time.","> TikTok has impeding ban US-wide and possibly Europe

Though a safer way to play this is to sell some Meta for Google which would also benefit from TikTok ban. That's what I did personally after Meta popped at $240

> Apple VR intro imminent next week, could crater Meta depending on what Apple reveals

The VR market is so small that I think Apple is more likely to expand the total addressable market than they are to take market share from Meta. More VR headset manufacturers leads to more VR developers who will probably develop for both platforms. Biggest problem right now is that there's really no compelling application to use VR, not that Meta's devices are limiting, maybe Apple developers can change that, who knows. 

Wall Street also hates VR so maybe Apple stock will crater after they announce their investment into it.

> Facebook is essentially a dead platform among zoomers and younger

But it doesn't really matter whether people are on Insta or Facebook","I'm reposting my old comment from July 2022 (possibly a month or two earlier), when shares were about $160 a piece.

I know the stock had IPO-ed early 2021 and the initial share price was $117, could the share price just be adjusting to its real value or what exactly is the issue?

It’s completely unrealistic to expect deflation in anything except gas, energy, and maybe, maybe home prices. But the way people are talking, they expect prices to go to 2020 levels again. They won’t. Ever. 

So push your boss for a raise. The Fed isn’t going to help you afford your bills.

share price,stocks,Roblox reference share price set at $45 ahead NYSE debut,"The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday set a reference price of $45 for shares of U.S. gaming platform Roblox Corp on the eve of its public market debut, implying a market value for the company of around $30 billion. San Mateo, California-based Roblox is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children and offers a host of games across mobile devices and gaming consoles. The reference price is not an offering price to purchase shares but rather will be a performance benchmark for when Roblox's stock starts trading on the stock exchange on Wednesday. The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers. Roblox has opted to go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). This means the company is not selling any shares in advance of its market debut, as is the case with IPOs. Direct listings are still relatively rare, though they are becoming increasingly popular way to go public amid criticism that investment banks underwriting IPOs underprice shares being sold to help create a first-day trading ""pop"" for the benefit of their big trading clients. Reuters reported last week that U.S. grocery delivery app Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through an IPO. Roblox said in January it had raised around $520 million in a new Series H private fundraising round in a deal which valued it at $29.5 billion, more than seven times the $4 billion the company was valued at in its Series G round 11 months earlier. U.S. demand for video games has surged as consumers seek home entertainment while living under lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. - Reuters

share price,stocks,TESLA will Cyber Truck sell well and move share price to a new all time high?,"Have to be honest with you I don’t currently have a position in Tesla. But I am intrigued about what I’m hearing regarding the release of the cyber truck. Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.  
According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.  

“Tesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times” 

There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.”

Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive. 

It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don’t see it going much lower than $200.00

share price,stocks,"Robinhood IPO Prices at $38 a Share; at the low end of expectations, after the popular trading platform met tepid demand","Robinhood Markets Inc. priced its initial public offering at $38 a share, at the low end of expectations, after the popular trading platform met tepid demand for its highly anticipated debut.

The price chosen by the company and its underwriters is at the bottom of the range of $38 to $42 a share they had been targeting. It pegs Robinhood’s valuation at about $32 billion, far higher than the nearly $12 billion it fetched in a funding round a year ago but below the lofty prior expectations of some investors and bankers.

Robinhood has said it and some executives would sell 55 million shares, so the offering should yield more than $2 billion.

The price reflects both hesitation on the part of some investors, who bristled at what they saw as the high valuation Robinhood sought, as well as a conscious decision by the company and its underwriters to be conservative in order to help set up a successful first-day of trading, according to people familiar with the matter.

Next up for Robinhood is its trading debut, which the company will make Thursday on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol HOOD. It is a markedly different debut than the traditional IPO. While most companies only allocate a small amount of stock to individual investors at the time of their IPOs, Robinhood sold a big chunk of its IPO shares to individual investors over its new platform that gives users access to IPOs before they start trading.

That high individual investor allocation is an X factor for Thursday’s debut. The large chunk in the hands of individual investors-—as well as the buzz around Robinhood by other individual investors who didn’t receive shares in the IPO—represents a wildcard, and some traders at banks that underwrite big IPOs say it is hard to predict how that will impact the stock at the open.

Robinhood’s decision earlier this year to stop users from buying meme stocks like GameStop Corp. GME -5.28% during the height of the frenzy for such shares rankled some investors and could prompt some to eschew the offering.

Past IPOs in which a significant percentage of shares were allocated to individual investors have struggled. In 2012, Facebook Inc. FB 1.49% sold about 25% of its IPO to individual investors. The stock closed slightly above its $38 IPO price in a rocky first day of trading before tumbling the next day, in part because many individual investors received more stock than they wanted. It took more than a year for Facebook to close above its IPO price again. In 2006, Vonage Holdings Corp. VG 0.56% allowed longtime customers to buy into its IPO. Its stock also wobbled in early trading.

The Robinhood listing is another landmark in a historic boom in IPOs as a rising stock market and hearty investor appetite entice a slew of successful private companies to shift to public ownership. Some 20 companies are going public each week this year, according to Dealogic. Traditional IPOs had raised more than $98 billion as of Tuesday, on the cusp of surpassing all of 1999 and 2000 as the biggest year ever for U.S.-listed IPOs.

In the nearly seven years since it launched its app, Robinhood has gone from a tiny startup to one of the largest U.S. retail brokerages. The firm, which popularized zero-commission trades, says its mission is to democratize investing. It is a philosophy Robinhood reinforced Saturday by hosting a live-streamed roadshow presentation for individual investors.

As of the end of June, the firm had 22.5 million funded accounts and its users held about $100 billion of assets on the Robinhood platform.

The company went viral earlier this year when millions of amateur investors downloaded its app to participate in the explosive rally in meme stocks like GameStop. The breakout moment nearly broke Robinhood, as the company had to restrict purchases of some high-flying stocks and raise billions of dollars in emergency capital to meet regulatory requirements that kicked in because of the increased trading volumes.

Robinhood bounced back and continued to attract new users, but, more recently, it flagged that its growth is slowing. The company said in a securities filing last week that it expects its third-quarter revenue to fall relative to the second quarter, partially due to decreased trading activity.

Its popularity has brought increased regulatory scrutiny too. In the past nine months, the company has agreed to pay more than $130 million to settle investigations into a range of its business practices. There could be more on the way: Robinhood disclosed this week that it got a new request for information from Wall Street’s self-regulatory body, Finra.

Everyone who said that was impossible now says it won't hold.  They may be right.

Streaming profit being just a year out is a lot better than expected, and despite the funky accounting, any streaming company would like to be able to say 5 million subs added.  

They've allegedly commenced their own ""year of efficiency"" cost cutting that Wall Street likes to hear.  Some of the savings might be owed to industry strikes.  

Iger seems engaged.  Activists are back.

Even if streaming is a push, parks and hospitality and merchandise continue to be unstoppable, up another 30%.  Critics overlook what powerhouses these are.

They might be shrewdly trying to optimize with bundles.  ESPN is the wild card.

Other streamers have risen on subscriber adds, better advertising prospects, lower competition for content.  

If Disney ever does figure out how to make another big hit movie, the stock will rip.  Maybe it will even have some oversold traction now?"

stock,stocks,Shouldn't the Nvidia stock be skyrocketing?,"Gamer here, live in a basement, play games 24/7, don't have money, don't own stocks.

But I do know what the stock market is.

So here is my question: *why on earth isn't the Nvidia stock going up and up until there is quite literally not enough money in any investor's pocket anymore to buy another share?*

Do the people with money not understand what's going on? Nvidia has 0 competition and every single one of the richest people on earth is buying as many GPUs as they can, probably paying double/triple to get their hardware delivered first. This is happening right now as we speak.

Sooooooo ... uhm ... do only people that game 24/7 actually get what the AI revolution entails? Isn't it obvious? Are nerds with 10+ years of ""experience"" in their field the only people that can actually tell what's happening? Like do I have to be a hobby pilot for 10 years to see when a revolutionary invention is happening in the aerospace industry? Is everyone else blind to that? I'm confused. Do people always think they are being tricked when it comes to stocks? You could have had a nerdy friend working in machine learning and he could have told you everything that's going down now back in 2019.

If I understand this correctly, then the only reason Nvidia stock isn't rising every week is because people think they are being tricked by nerdy gamers?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Alright, thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts! Really appreciate it. To wrap up, here's a summary of the reasons why Nvidia stock isn't continually rising:

* People only trust their own eyes. Which I think is fair. I could sit here forever explaining how the AI revolution will play out and people would still wait until they can actually feel the impact themselves. For example, in the next 4 weeks, ChatGPT will roll out an image creator. A large amount of normies will absolutely love that feature. Normie subs to ChatGPT -> normie loves it -> normie understands Nvidia hardware is driving it -> normie invests -> stock rises. That's the only way it happens. No reddit post can compete with that.
* Supply. Nvidia just can not keep up with the orders. The demand is wayyy higher than the supply. And this isn't changing anytime soon. Takes forever to build these factories.
* Ursula got wind of the numbers Nvidia is crankin' out and is preparing a 4 billion fine for being smarter than the competition.
* Geopolitical uncertainties.

stock,stocks,Intel Stock is it really worth it,"

Intel (INTC) is one of the largest and most established chipmakers in the world, but it has been facing some serious challenges in recent years. Its stock price has been declining since April 2021, when it reached its all-time high of 63.12 USD. Some of the reasons for this drop are the increasing competition from other chipmakers such as AMD, NVIDIA and Apple, the delays and difficulties in its transition to the 7-nanometer and 10-nanometer chip manufacturing processes, and the rising costs and supply chain disruptions caused by the global semiconductor shortage. However, Intel is also trying to improve its situation by investing in its own chip fabrication plants and expanding its foundry services to other customers, launching new products and platforms such as Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids and Arc, and acquiring or partnering with other companies such as Mobileye, SiFive and GlobalFoundries. These moves could help Intel increase its revenue and margins, boost its performance and competitiveness, and enhance its capabilities and diversify its portfolio in the areas of autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and advanced chip manufacturing. So is  even worth it buying and holding onto stock or is it better avoiding buying all together",355,How heavy are your bags?,"Their financial performance is worse it appears in GAAP statements.

stock,stocks,Elon Musk says he’s ‘sold enough’ Tesla stock to satisfy his 10% goal,"Elon Musk said Tuesday he’s met his goal of selling 10% of his stake in Tesla Inc., and criticized California for “overtaxation.” In a nearly hourlong podcast interview with the satirical website the Babylon Bee, the Tesla TSLA, +4.29% CEO said: “I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option-exercise stuff, and I tried to be extremely literal here.”

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Musk exercised 2 million more options and sold nearly 584,000 more Tesla shares Tuesday, bringing the total number of shares sold over the past month-plus to about 13.5 million — slightly shy of the roughly 17 million shares that constituted his 10% stake as of Nov. 7, when he posted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell. He’s made more than $14 billion in those sales. But over that time he’s also exercised options to buy about 16.4 million stock options at about $6.24 a share, actually increasing his stake in the electric-auto maker.

Musk also tweeted Sunday night that he will pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year. That equates to about 8.06 million of his recently sold shares going to his tax bill on stock options set to expire next year. Musk, who has insulted top Democrats in recent weeks who have called for him to pay more in taxes, took a parting shot at California’s high taxes.

“California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is… becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation,” he told the Babylon Bee.

This year, Musk moved his residence and Tesla’s corporate headquarters from California to Texas, which has significantly lower taxes. Musk is the world’s wealthiest individual according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, with a fortune of about $245 billion — up nearly $89 billion this year alone. In Tuesday’s podcast, Musk reiterated that his wealth is tied up in stock. “It’s not like I’ve got some sort of massive cash balance,” he said. Tesla shares gained more than 4% Tuesday and are up 33% year to date. The company’s stock has soared more than 1,100% over the past three years.

stock,stocks,DraftKings CEO says people selling his company’s stock will ‘regret that decision more than any other decision you’ve ever made in your life,"DraftKings Inc. DKNG, 3.16% CEO Jason Robins vows that people who are selling his company’s stock will “regret that decision.”

Robins wrote this message on Twitter TWTR, 4.85% on Tuesday as DraftKings stock continued its recent slump.

“If you sold #DKNG today, just be aware that my team and I are on a mission to make you regret that decision more than any other decision you’ve ever made in your life,” he tweeted. The post had drawn around 2,000 likes by press time on Wednesday, and was quoted or retweeted about 500 times.

Robins has been dismissive of the slumping stock price of his sports betting and daily fantasy company of late, and opted for a more optimistic long-term approach, instead.

“It’s a wild market right now. I think what we’re doing has been very consistent since day one,” Robins said on CNBC in February. “I think the model’s working, and we’ll play the long game here.”

DraftKings’s trading price has plummeted in recent months, exacerbating a downturn that has now lasted more than a year.  DraftKings stock was trading at $17.82 on Wednesday, near its recent 52-week low of $16.56. The stock is down over 43% over the past three months, and down 72.1% over the last 12 months.

In February, DraftKings disclosed that Robins’s total compensation in 2021 was $14.03 million, down from $236.83 million in 2020. 

During the company’s latest earnings call, Robins advocated for more states to legalize sports betting, and specifically urged legalization in California, the most populous state in the country.

Robins suggested that the tax revenue that California would receive from legalizing sports betting would directly benefit ‘homelessness and mental health’ in the state. Thirty U.S. states and Washington, D.C. now offer some form of legalized sports wagering, according to the latest tally from the American Gaming Association.",683,I got married before 20.

stock market prices,stocks,Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market,"I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.

Here is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.

[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  
[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security’s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.

[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.

[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.

[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a ""cloud"" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.

[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.

MA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.

Pivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.

SAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.

SuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.",5355,"The best indicator for newbies is this one:

**If you see 20 threads a day about a stock, you're too late.**","I personally use only 3 Moving average at 20,50,200 periods. All the rest of my analysis is based on fundamentals and future growth",Thank you for writing this out. When I first learned about VWAP it changed how I approached day trading entirely. Another indicator I would suggest new traders to explore and monitor would be Macro sentiments which also helps to determine if a stock is currently overbought or oversold.

stock market prices,stocks,The stock market hasn’t priced in a recession just yet... the S&P 500 could fall another 23%,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-stock-market-hasnt-priced-in-a-recession-just-yet-if-it-does-the-sandp-500-could-fall-another-23percent-morgan-stanley-says/ar-AAYHJIu?li=BBnbfcL)

With the S&P 500 down more than 20% this year, both retail and institutional investors are debating whether the worst is over for stocks.  

The answer? Don’t bet the house on it—or at least that’s what Morgan Stanley says.

The investment bank’s strategists, led by Chief Investment Officer Michael J. Wilson, said in a Tuesday research note that the S&P 500 has yet to price in a full-blown economic recession.

 Today’s 15.3x price-to-earnings multiple for the S&P 500 could fall to 14x if a recession comes, they said.

While that still isn’t the base case for Morgan Stanley, the investment bank’s economists see a 35% chance of recession by the first half of 2023.

 “The market is going to have a really difficult time looking forward until it knows that the risk of recession is extinguished. And we won’t know the answer to that for at least three or four months, is my guess,” Wilson said. “As soon as the recession is obvious, that’ll probably really be the time you want to step in.”",746,[deleted],awesome. great time to build wealth!,Stock market hasn't priced in the bull market after the recession just yet....S&P500 could rise another 100%

trade,stocks,What $GME has taught me in 36 hours of day trading,"Jumped on the $GME bandwagon on Friday, 4 @ \~316. My 36 hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out, I will never YOLO on a bubble ever again.

The principle seemed straightforward: hedge funds got lazy/greedy, over-shorted their positions, bet against a company that wasn't actually going under, and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze. Even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market, the basic premise makes sense. But the devil's in the details, and hype is blinding.

First red flag was when I realized [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) did not bet on the short squeeze, he bet on undervalued stock price *over a year ago*. He has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze, he walks away with 8 figures. So the people screaming ""if he's still in, I'm still in!"" and ""look at those brass balls, if he can lose $5MM in a day then I can hold"" are really living up to the dumb ape meme. He didn't lose $5MM yesterday, he lost $5MM in \*unrealized gains\*, there is a \*huge\* difference.

Second red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds won't go down without a fight, and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience. You don't get that without learning how to game the system in complex, subtle ways. So even if they are still heavily shorted (which they might not even be anymore), and even if somehow [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them, that doesn't rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about.

But even in the off chance that somehow this turns around, and $GME does go ""to the moon,"" that doesn't change the fact that it's bad long-term strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons. They almost certainly fail, and if they don't, they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble. I'm still holding my shares but I don't expect to see my \~$1200 ever again. In the off chance I break even or see a profit here, I will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains.

**Edit:** holy shit RIP my inbox. No way I can read all that.

Want to clarify a few things. Not financial advice.

**My position:** I knew I was late to the party. I *wanted* to gamble. I knew what I was doing, and (mostly) why I did it. Hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than I wanted to admit, but still, I'm not surprised by the outcome so far, and I'm totally OK with taking the L and calling it a lesson learned. I don't blame DFV, WSB, or anyone for my choices. I own them, even proudly, because I wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs. sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss. I'm holding because I already bought my tickets to this ride, want to see this thing play out, and I'm fine with gambling the final $300 on the outside chance things turn around.

**Your positions:** brothers, sisters, nonbinary siblings: **you are not your portfolio**. whether up or down, your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is. you are a human being on the bleeding edge of 3.5 BILLION years of evolution, you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than you'll ever know. 12 years ago I was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on 211 Steel Reserve. I hit my bottom, joined AA, and now I'm a network engineer, wife, kids, the whole lot. Anything is possible if you don't give up on yourself. But I know it's not that easy, we all need borrowed self-esteem before we can see the real value inside. So if this $GME gamble hit you hard, please reach out to someone. don't give up. Hell, this bubble isn't even over, it might even turn around! But either way, don't give up.

**Edit2:**

wow, never expected this to go this far. wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation. read a ton of replies, probably missed most of them. thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween! A few more points:

* Agreed that RH deserves to be held accountable. No question they manipulated this.
* Agreed it's not over yet. the squeeze could happen. but if it does, **my** main personal takeaway from this experience will stand: I won't speculate on bubbles anymore. This is my position if I lose everything or make $100k.
* if you posted gains, that's awesome! so glad for you, I wish you the best!

**Edit3 2/3/21:**

Full disclosure, I closed my position this morning at a \~$900 realized loss.

My gut says the squeeze happened, short interest isn't what I thought it was on Friday, and the stock will return to actual value soon.

**Edit4 2/25/21:**

**I stand by my decisions, both to buy and to sell. I don't speculate on bubbles. Period. But you can do whatever the fuck you want with your money and you'll never find me shaming you about it.**",26721,"Unlike most - I actually watched most of DFV's videos. He was never bettering on the short squeeze.  He was campaigning for GME being around for much longer.

WSB was shitting all over him when he was posting his losses, up until he started making great profit. That's when they all started calling him their God.","Another good lesson that you performed is to never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially on a risky play. By going in with just 4 @ $316, it's easier to look at things from a more objective lens and not fall prey to the hopes, hypes, and hysteria when the price swings big.

I'm in the same boat as you, and I'm taking this as a very educational week.",The biggest winner in this whole farce is AMC. The company literally got $600m for free without doing anything.
trade,stocks,Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653

Hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers’ actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found

Thousands of officials across the government’s executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.

More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.

A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.

The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.

The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren’t available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.


Among the Journal’s findings:

• While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

• More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.

• More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.

• At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.

• About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.

• When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency’s work.
Number of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks, 2016-21

Federal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield “immense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,” said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.

He said many of the examples in the Journal analysis “clearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public’s confidence in the integrity of the government.”

Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. “The buck stops with the official,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. “It’s the official who could benefit or be harmed…. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.”

Investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.

Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.

This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.

U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.

The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges.

A view of Washington, D.C.

Most officials’ financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.

Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven’t turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn’t provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)

Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren’t considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn’t restrict investing in diversified funds.

Some federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is “committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government,” said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.

At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump’s pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.

Mr. Molina’s job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He “reviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,” said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a “personal and confidential representative” of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.

In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.

Reported trades in energy and mining firms;

made by spouse through a financial adviser

The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband’s account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.

Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don’t conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal’s review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.

In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn’t know much about the energy trades. “I can say this on the record: I didn’t even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,” he said.

In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.

In about 2½ years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina’s disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.

In the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.

Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.

After publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: “Neither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‘pool’ of several dozen clients—not for us individually.”

Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency’s ethics office “counseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.” EPA officials signed Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.

U.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.

The EPA doesn’t have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren’t working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina’s boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.

Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department’s director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.

Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias’s portfolio.

Mr. Zacharias’s office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn’t attend those meetings.

In an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn’t involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. “I could always walk downstairs and ask them how it’s going. But that really wasn’t an interest of mine,” he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.

Mr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn’t pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: “I’m just the pipe-smoking science guy.”

The Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal’s analysis.

“I apologize that things don’t look good on the buy side,” Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: “I just decided that would be a good investment at the time.”

He said ethics officials didn’t raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be “a little tighter.”

A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias “worked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.” She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees’ disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.

Some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies’ misunderstanding of their own rules.

The FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are “significantly regulated” by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.

An FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.

Mr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA’s planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.

Mr. Bertoni’s lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.

The stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.

They did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni’s forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. “The FDA’s Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,” the attorney said in an email.

After considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.

An FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family’s holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.

“The FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,” said the spokesman.

When federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.

Valerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board’s Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.

Members of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers’ rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office dismissed the charge in January 2021.

Last November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.

The NLRB’s inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.

The report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney’s office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report—Ms. Hardy-Mahoney—received additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.

Ms. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.

At the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei’s husband.

In June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank “in a very, very difficult position.” Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he “just would love to see” a clear policy on the matter.

Because Mr. Powell didn’t dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.

In early September 2018, Ms. Wei’s husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.

It then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.

Ms. Wei’s husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei’s disclosure.

The Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.

The new Fed rules for top people don’t apply to Ms. Wei because she isn’t senior enough. The trades were “permissible then and are permissible now,” said the Fed spokeswoman.

Ms. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had “no responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.” She said the Fed “did not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.”

Ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei’s trades didn’t violate conflicts rules.

The Federal Reserve building in Washington.

Roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.

In one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC’s own rules.

The financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal’s review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020—an average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.

About one-third of those reported 2020 trades—2,994—involved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.

Over the years, to safeguard the CFTC’s integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees’ investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC’s role doesn’t include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.

Nonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail’s husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission “could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.” The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission’s statutory authority.

Mr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn’t speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn’t respond to requests for comment.

At the CFTC, “employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,” said the agency spokesman. “In this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse’s investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.”

Mr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: “The FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.”

The Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.

Across the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.

Reed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

At the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.

Defense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.

Nearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn’t include Alibaba. The company’s stock rose 4% that day.

Three days later, Mr. Werner’s financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.

The sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.

In an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn’t involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.

The Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn’t own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee’s duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.

At least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon’s top cybersecurity official.

Between 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

Mr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn’t direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn’t involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn’t see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.

Within federal agencies, ethics officials generally don’t consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials’ ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don’t know what employees are working on.

When ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies’ inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.

A Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.

One matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse’s financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren’t allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official’s work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.

When a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC’s inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.

The SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: “We take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.”

Are stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.

Most federal agencies don’t have protocols to verify that officials’ financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.

The official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.

At the EPA, Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.

The conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not “participate personally and substantially” in matters that have a “direct and predictable effect” on their investments and those of family members.

When the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn’t have any influence over environmental policy.

His “duties are administrative in nature,” his boss, the EPA’s chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. “He provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect” on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina’s financial disclosure.

In his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn’t file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.

Ethics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina “scores” of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In one email, a senior ethics official said his office had “provided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.”

Mr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn’t know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.

In September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.

“We have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,” wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, “so I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.”

The next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. “I feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,” he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.

“If the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,” Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. “I believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.”

Ethics officials didn’t investigate Mr. Molina’s trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.

On the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina’s final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.

Mr. Molina wrote out a personal check to “U.S. Treasury” and sent it to officials in the EPA’s ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed.",1816,Buffet says invest in what you know.,"At this point, what even is there to do ?

in the current times of turmoil I sometimes look back at ten year charts and think to myself: Goddamn I'd be so fucking rich if I had started investing 10 years ago. Given the current state of the world, I'd not be sure we see those gains ever again. 

Some of todays industry trends were visible back then, like E-Commerce, electric payments, clean energy or semiconductors. Many companies out of those sectors that were around back then and are around today, multiplied it's value by at least 10x. Even broad investing into indexes would have made you 3 to 6 times richer.

It provides a work management platform as software as service that enables individuals and teams to get work done faster while enhancing employee engagement by allowing everyone to see how their work connects to the mission of an organization.

**Bullish Signs:**

* Founded by Facebook co-founder (left in 2008 to start Asana) who just bought $70m in shares on 7 different buys at average of $43/share in the last two weeks. Partner is ex-Google executive, so they know their tech.
* [Dollar Retention Rate YOY was 115%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/04/why-asana-stock-popped-today/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article), meaning last year’s customers spent \~115% more this year to continue using the product / expand their use. Sign that current customers not only like the product, but want to use it more.
* [Revenue projections](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asana-rises-revising-fiscal-guidance-112157591.html) were recently increased by 5%, from \~$314m to $340m for FY2022.

**Bearish Signs:**

* Without owner’s continued purchases, the stock would lose a lot of momentum and return to a more normalized volume/price.
* $230m in revenues and -$210m in [net income](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/asan/financials/cash-flow), but now a $9b valuation. Doesn’t add up, can’t be sustained.
* Has set a new All-Time High almost every day for the last two weeks. Correction seems overdue.
* Above the upper Bollinger Band (shown in image reference), which is a big sign it is oversold and likely to return closer to the current mean ($40.34), even if the company performs well in the long term. Went down significantly within 2 months the last time it went above the Upper BB.
* RSI above 90, meaning it is oversold and should return closer to the mean soon.
* Revenue increased by $85m last year, but marketing expenses increased by $84m and total expenses increased by $142m. Basically, every $1 spent on marketing only brought in $1 in revenue, which is awful for any business. It is especially bad for a product that doesn’t have long term contracts and easy access to market for competitors. However, we’ve already determined current customers seem to like the product, so maybe spending a lot of money to get new customers is good for long term growth.
* July Put/Call Volume is basically even (shown in image reference). Stock went up huge in June on a .16 P/C volume ratio, but the next 30 days are .99 P/C ratio. In June, 7x more people were betting it would go up vs. down, now it is even for July. Will be a lot more downwards pressure in the next 30 days if stock buyers/sellers match that ratio.
* Accumulation vs. Distribution is (literally) off the charts, 3x higher than a month ago. This isn’t the kind of stock that people will just hodl forever. Eventually, these people that have had 60% gains in the last two weeks will sell for a profit and the spike will end.
* [StockTwit overall sentiment is -6%](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ASAN), with many of the bullish comments admitting they are probably going to take profits and rebuy soon. Rather unusual for a stock that has gone up so quickly, so sentiment seems way down.

Any opinions on the short-term outlook for this stock that I am missing?

Then and only then  develop a \~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD.  For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.

It also taught me to have a strategy on both the upside run and to manage downside risk (if any drops by \~15% I am out but will watch).  On the upside, I take profits at 25% and if its 50%, I sell 1/2 - 1/3 and let the remainder ride and not really tracking it. (Today those stocks include FB, BABA, CC, AMD, and LLY.)

trading strategy,stocks,"Swing trading strategy development, and general questions. Small account.","Quick background info feel free to skip:
I started trading early September and stopped about a week before the election because I thought that market was to volatile and I wasn’t interested in losing money. I was trading real money but only $200. I know  lots of people say I should have paper traded but I have consistent income and despite the risk I thought of it as if that $200 had bought me a new “toy”. I was in it for fun not necessarily profit. I ended up adding another $50 over the course of the weeks I traded. I mostly traded by obsessively watching the news and being a bandwagon. I made it up to $290, up $40. I also ended up losing all of my profit, I don’t remember why I should probably find out so I don’t do it again. Anyways after I lost all my profit I was down to 250 again and with the election near I took my money out.

A factor I entirely missed was technical analysis, I wasn’t interested to be frank and just wanted to play the news. Not only that but I didn’t even know exactly what kind of trading I was doing, day trading swing trading and so on. I had zero strategy.

I’m getting back into stocks (they’re fascinating and exciting) and a lot of the stuff that didn’t make since before has settled and now makes much more sense but I’m still kind of stuck with a few things.

I’d like to swing trade and here are some things I’ve picked up and would like corrected/ confirmed, as well as some follow up.

I have seen several swing trading strategy videos where an RSI below 30 is a must. Why is this and how important is this? When doing more research I see people analyzing charts and often times other criteria are met like MACD but the RSI may be at 40 or higher, which again raises the question how important is RSI?

What are the most important swing trading indicators in your opinion. From what I can gather it’s RSI, MACD,  and moving day averages. That being said I also see people who just make trend lines on consistent graphs (zig zags that are higher peaks higher lows) and these people pretty much just say buy in when the PPS meets the bottom trend line.

What are the most useful patterns in your opinion, I see cup and handle being mentioned, the zig zag, and big gap downs where you just wait for the stock to recover. I know there are many more than these but I’m trying to simplify this for myself which is why I only ask to have 3 very good ones provided.

Is risk management pretty much as simple as understanding the ratio of how much you can lose vs how much you can make, paired with stop loss orders? Anything more in depth on this is appreciated.

I think I understand the general difference between large cap and small cap companies but I don’t understand why you’d trade one over another. So far the only difference I see is that large cap appears more consistent, which I assume is easier to play?

What factors go into choosing your price range for stocks? The most consistent I see for swing trading is 15$-$50. Obviously that’s dependent on capital though. Given I’ll start with around $700 where should I aim? The main reason I ask is because the more expensive it is the less shares I own, the more the stock has to run for me to make profit. Whereas I could buy the cheap stock and since I own more shares I need less percent increase to make the same profit? 

Sorry if these are bad questions or have been asked before. I’ve tried YouTube but every video looks the same or they go over the same things. Three quarters of them don’t even give you a real strategy or real information, they just explain a mindset. I won’t lie I probably could have found this info somewhere but this is so much easier. That being said and resources for those questions are greatly appreciated.",3,"It is very difficult to make real money swing trading.  There are lots and lots of strategies out there based on dozens of different technical indicators.  I tried it for years with very mixed success.  And I put a lot of work into it too.

trading strategy,stocks,Trading strategy for when you’re up?,"I have a rough idea of a strategy for what to do when a stock I hold goes down.  I can dollar cost average to lower my cost basis.  This strategy works as long as I have money to throw at the stock and if I assume that the stock will go up again.  That’s a big assumption, I know.

What do you guys do when you hold a stock that has made gains and is up?  When and how much do you sell?

For a while I thought that I should hold for a year or more to pay the lower long term tax rate but that idea seems fairly poor when the market is extremely volatile. 

A strategy I have considered is to sell all my shares and then rebuy at the same level to lock in gains.  I think this would lock in any profits in the near term and could enable further dollar cost averaging if the shares go down again.  If the shares continue to go up then at least I still have them.

What are your thoughts?",8,"If you sell and rebuy you have to pay taxes on the sale. So you'd need to buy back at a much lower level for your plan to work.

trading strategy,stocks,FOR EVERYONE NEW TO INVESTING: A COMPREHENSIVE BREAKDOWN OF TRADING AND MANIPULATION STRATEGIES!,"**Current Conditions of the Market:**

Let me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There’s a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don’t make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous “pump and dumps” where stocks become inflated, and based on fool’s theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research. 

**Basic Stock Jargons & Short/Long Positions:**

*Long* \- you’re buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.

*Short* \- you’re borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I’ll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:

* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.
* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.
* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is “long” on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.
* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10. 
* Two hypothetical situation happens now:
   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he’s making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the “short” lost money, the “long” gained money, and the “lender” made interest money. 
   * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the “short” made money, the “long” lost money, and the “lender” made interest money. 
* The above scenarios help to show why “shorts” (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc. 

**Market Manipulation:**

Market manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy “whales” or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are “shorts”. Some are “neutral” and act as lenders to make money, some are “growth-based” and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are “short” which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.

**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**

Market manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.

*Scenario 1:*

Let’s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can “hedge” or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the “premium” or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly “cover”, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.

*Scenario 2:*

Let’s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name “FANG” stocks.

 If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing “newly” purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc. 

*Scenario 3:*

This one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster. 

Algorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I’ll start by talking about “market orders” vs “limit orders”. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says “market order” or “limit order”. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a “limit order”, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated. 

In the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it’s processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you’re that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER.

trading strategy,stocks,Trading Strategy on Capital Gains/Losses,"I [posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/y422lz/capital_gainslosses_strategy/) same question over in /tax and didn't get any actual input..

Has anyone taken this approach?  If so, what are the upsides/downsides?

I  have $25,000 in long term and short term capital gains this year, and I'm looking at a pretty hefty tax bill.  Between state and federal taxes, I estimate I'll owe 25%.

I'm under the impression the odds are in favor of me day trading.   Theoretically there is a 50/50 the markets will go up or down.  If I buy $100k of SPY, for example and only hold it for the day - I  theoretically have a 50% chance of making money.  However if it goes down 1% and I sell, I realize a $1,000 loss.  This would lower my capital gains to $24,000.

Instead of me paying the gov't $6,250 on $25,000  I'd pay $6,000 on $24,000.   Which means my 1% loss of $1,000 is essentially a loss of 0.75%, or $750.  And if it goes up, same thing.  I make $1,000 and have $750 left over after taxes.

As long as I have capital gains, is there any downside to this strategy?",5,"There is essentially never a benefit to intentionally losing money to offset capital gains, you will always lose more money then you would have had to pay in taxes. The only benefits could be if you had an opportunity cost to allocate capital elsewhere or if for some bizarre reason there was changing legislation/tax brackets upcoming. Just pay your taxes.","Man you robbed 10 min of my life thinking about this shitty theory making any sense.

It does not. Losses are losses. Gains are gains. Only thing you can decide is you want to have more cash now (tax harvest) or later (hold). 

At best market tanks and you lose 25k. If you harvest you have 6k more cash in your pocket today (instead of some point later in your investment life) but market did fuck you. Nice strategy.","I was just thinking the same thing, sort of. Sell a chunk of net losers, wait 30 days, and rebuy. It would reduce my taxes from other income sources. 

also, depending on your tax bracket, long term gains are lower tax % than short term. The trick would be to realize your enough losses to cover realized gains, while holding the unrealized gains long till next year, to lower the tax bracket. (While also avoiding wash sale.)

“You can deduct capital losses up to the amount of your capital gains plus $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately). You may be able to use capital losses that exceed this limit in future years.” (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sd.pdf)

So in your case, you could “lose” up to $28,000 this year.  

This is known as tax-loss harvesting btw."

Coinbase will take additional steps to ensure that it offers protection for its retail customers that match those offered to Prime and Custody consumers, Armstrong said in Twitter thread late Tuesday. “We should have updated our retail terms sooner, and we didn’t communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added,” Armstrong wrote. “My deepest apologies.”Shares in the company [fell 16%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-10/coinbase-plunges-after-first-quarter-revenue-misses-estimate) after regular trading as first-quarter revenue missed analyst estimates.

>This disclosure makes sense in that **these legal protections have not been tested in court for cr\*pto assets specifically, and it is possible, however unlikely, that a court would decide to consider customer assets as part of the company in bankruptcy proceedings**...

(Emphasis added.)

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/udyyg5/what_is_going_on_with_coin/) last week about COIN asking for opinions because it was trading with a deep margin of safety based on DCF. The stock is down another 54% in the last 13 days since my post following an earnings miss on the top and bottom lines.

I listened to the earnings call yesterday and thought management had a good strategy and plan for execution. However, this news is making me think of the CEO's response to a question from an investor about COIN's moat. Long story short, COIN doesn't really have a moat, but the CEO claims consumer ""trust"" in COIN is like a moat because it allows COIN to sell people who come to their platform to buy or trade cr\*pto new services like NFTs, staking, DeFi, *etc.* They really made a big thing about how much their consumers trust them and how big a competitive advantage that is in a space like cr\*pto where people coming into the market for the first time will generally get into the game through the most trusted name. I think this news — that your assets held by COIN, including their custody business, could be seized in the event of COIN's bankruptcy — should undermine customer trust in COIN. Failing to disclose such a significant risk in a timely manner is a huge red flag for me as a potential investor and attorney.

If there's enough interest from COIN bag-holders, I can do a preliminary legal analysis of the bankruptcy issues to assess the CEO's claim it is ""unlikely"" a court would allow the seizure of Coinbase's customers' cr\*pto. The fact the claim is untested in court is enough for me not to trust the CEO's conclusory opinion.

I personally would not hold my cr\*pto on COIN until there is legal certainty the assets are safe in the case of bankruptcy. Consequently, I have a negative outlook on COIN's custody business; therefore, I have a negative outlook on COIN's so-called moat and ability to upsell new customer's into more products. If people start using COIN for best-price execution only and begin moving their coins to another platform to hold and use their cr\*pto, then COIN's ceiling is a cr\*pto trading platform, not the all-service cr\*pto platform management is selling to investors.",2233,[deleted],Holy fuck I better cut my losses fron my $20 Shiba investment,"P.S.

options market,wallstreetbets,Upcoming Week 2/19 Geee Em Eeee ITM Options Targets: Playing The Market Fuckery... Pt. 2...," Well, as I predicted, they kept the price over $50 so that the stack of 10,000 (yes, ten thousand options) Put contracts didn't get executed. That tells me that they aren't just tanking the price, and that they are playing the options spread at the moment.

It also tells me that they are scared shitless of shares needing to be delivered and taken off of the open market. They'd rather keep the price boosted over $50 to stop delivery than to risk an extra 1,000,000 shares getting into long hands.

But, thankfully, that also let's us know that they're still playing the game. If they were giving up and going into all-or-nothing mode, they wouldn't give a shit about the deliveries. They'd either flood the market with 25,000,000 FTDs while tanking the price to cover at $20 while hoping they have enough left over for the fines... Or they'd cash out what they have left now and file for bankruptcy while leaving the clearing houses to pay the bad debt.

No, they're still planning on finding the cheapest way out of this without any (or minimal) legal trouble. That means we're still getting paid. (Eventually...)

I've been watching this for a while now, and I think I've gotten a hand on what they are doing. This coming week will be the tell-all... And I'm going to explain why I believe the price can only go up...

So. Let's crunch the 2/19 option chain and see where this train is headed... - This Week, oooon Gaaaaaame Theeeeory!... *queue intro music*...

Current price $52:

Put ITM: 59,434

Put OTM: 346,288

Call ITM: 29,930

Call OTM: 87,111

At Current Price, a total of 89,364 option contracts are ITM.

Now, let's look at possible price movement. See, they are keeping Gee em eee at the line of demarcation between the single-dollar price change contracts ($41-$42-$43-et al.)... And the five-dollar price change per contract ($50-$55-$60-et al.)

That means that for every dollar that the stock drops, it executes a new Put option contract... But it would need to climb five dollars to execute a new call option. That's why I told you in the last thread that they are playing between the $50-$54.99 range all week.

See, because of the contract price structuring, it actually costs them MORE to knock the price down any lower. Allow me to explain:

Lets look at both the Call and Put sides of the option chain... And for the nearest $10 swing in prices...

There are 29,337 Put Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 2,459 Put Options for $51-$59 strike.

There are 13,187 Call Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 3,066 Call Options for $51-$59 strike.

Now, lemme explain why I believe this matters in predicting where the price is going to drift this week.

If the price were to drop by $10, the net difference would be an ADDITIONAL 16,150 options that would be executed because of the contract price structuring. 10 Put Options would become in the money.

Conversely, if the price went UP by $9, the net difference would be 507 extra contracts that would be able to be executed. Because of the price structuring, only two new Call Option strikes would be able to be executed between $55-$59.

If we were to just look at the next five Put Option contracts below the current strike price, it equals up to 22,175. That means if the price were to DROP $5, they would need to find delivery for an EXTRA 2,217,500 shares.

If the price were to go UP by $5, they would only need to find 85,600 extra shares to cover the extra contracts that would be ITM at $55.

Let me say that again. If the price goes DOWN... It takes MORE shares off the market because of the Put Options going in dollar increments, while the Call Options go up in $5 increments.

It is also interesting to note that ending the week at $59 would cause less deliveries than ending at $55.

My hypothesis: They can't hold the price at $50 this upcoming week simply due to the lack of shares available and the buyer demand staying so consistent. We only had 12mil-13mil volume the last two days. The shares are drying up.

So if they can't hold the price steady, they need to decide which direction to move it. And based on the math, moving the price UP would save the shorts money by causing the lesser of two evils in extra deliveries.

But one thing is for sure. They can't let the price tank any lower this upcoming week. It would trigger too many new deliveries.

(There's actually some serious game theory that says the best move to trigger the squeeze would be for us to ALLOW the price to drop to exactly $39.99 at close of next week... as odd as that seems)

So what's my non-financially-advising-crystal-ball predict that this weeks close will be on 2/19?...

$58.47...

They are going to allow some big single-day swings Tuesday and Wednesday to send the stock price from $52 up to tickle the $60 mark so that they can go balls-deep selling $60C Premium... And then they will hold the price just below the line.

The next target after that would be $69 (giggity), as there is a large off-set of Calls vs Puts at $70 that would cause the delivery equilibrium to start going net positive again. I just don't think they're going to let us get $19 in a single week, as that would cause retail investor interest to start going up again.

Tl;dr: We end next week at $58-$59 and the slow bleeding continues until the week of Feb 26.

I'll be back when I finish another model I'm working on...

 orgininally posted by u / ThatGuyOntheReddits",4204,"Nice job, but here are the two things you are missing:

1. If there is a significant upward pressure these puts will back fire, since they will have to buy back the shares that they shorted to hedge them. They clearly orchestrated a massive reverse gamma squeeze to bring down the price, but here is the thing about gamma squeezes: they are not sustainable! Once these options expire, the price will shoot back were it originally was.

2. A lot of put options expired last week (less than what we have this week, but still there were a lot of them). MMs have to buy back the shares that they shorted to “hedge” those puts. This in itself can create the needed upward pressure I mentioned in 1. Once the price starts going up (especially if institutions also help the push), you’ll see a the biggest inverse of a “reverse gamma squeeze” you’ve ever seen in history.

Here is also an important difference between a gamma squeeze and a reverse gamma squeeze: when a gamma squeeze is over, market makers are in control since they have a lot of shares they can now dump at whatever price they want, but once a reverse gamma squeeze is over, market makers are at mercy of whoever bought the shares they’ve shorted and have to pay up any price shareholders decide!

options market,wallstreetbets,Buyer Beware: The saga of my DGLY options “market” order.,"Posting for a friend who is too new to post himself (good rule, btw). I am “my boy” from the set-up. His words below. 

“Greetings to my fellow autists. Sharing this story to hopefully save at least one other soul from going through the last 5 hours of hell I just endured. 

The set-up: me and my boy were looking to make a play on DGLY, thanks to some research on his part and some good DD from some of y’all here on WSB. Well, when the market opened today we went to place our calls. I put in a 10 limit orders at the current ask price (about $1.60 at the time), but no takers. I put in a limit order at $.10 above ask, still nothing. Finally I say fuck it and throw in a market order figuring I’ll end up paying $2.00 or so. Order goes through, all is well. Or is it... I look at the transaction and I got the contracts FOR $21.20 EACH. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! 

I immediately shit myself and stare at my computer screen for about 2 minutes in shock. My account immediately reflects the loss and I’m now down about $20,000. As reality slowly starts to set in and I wipe the tears away, I decide to call my broker. Of course I’m on hold for about 15 minutes waiting for them to pick up but finally I get through. I regale Cliff with my dreadful tale and he gets to work talking with his office to see what he can do. After about 20 more minutes I hear back, apparently during the time I was trying to buy my calls, there was a 5 minute window that no trades were going through. I put in my market order and some how or another someone nabbed it up for the tasty $20000 tendies. He says that his guys in the back office are going to call down to the trading floor, but not to hold my breath because he’s never seen a trade get reversed in his life. He says that this process may take a few hours but that he will get back to me ASAP, then politely hangs up. 

As I put my phone down, I start to think about all the amazing trades I could have made with this $20000, and slowly come to terms with the fact that 1) I’m never seeing this money again, 2) my wife is going to absolutely murder me, and 3) I am probably not going to work today as I am far to depressed to do anything other than play my PS4 and try to pretend I’m not living in this horrific nightmare. 

After a few hours of gaming, I’m just as sad as before and I decide I need to eat something even though I’m very nauseated and not at all hungry. At this point it’s past noon my time and this ordeal has been going on for almost 5 hours. Suddenly, my phone starts exploding and it’s my broker app. I see random trades start going on my account for DGLY calls, 1-2 at a time. First they are buys for $21.20, then buys for $3.10. I’m confused but also excited as any action is good action at this point. About 10 minutes later, I check my account balance and it’s back to normal. My broker calls and tells me that, somehow, the market makers saved my ass and gave me the trades for $3.10 each instead of $21.20. He also informs me that in the 5 years he’s worked there he and his coworkers have never seen a trade reversed like this, and that it’s an actual miracle. I’m literally speechless. After Cliff says “Hello?” A couple times and I come back to my senses I thank him for his hard work and offer to name my first born after him, to which he laughs and politely says he was just doing his job. We part ways, and I stand in my kitchen staring out the window, wondering if this all really happened, or if it was just a terrible dream. (Then of course I look at my account again and see the calls, which are of course still red. But hey, I just got $17000 back so I’m not complaining). 

I fully expect to get absolutely obliterated by some of you all for not knowing this could happen, but I genuinely didn’t realize how bad you could get fucked by a market order. As I said in the beginning, if this saves even one person from what I just went through then all the downvotes will be worth it. 

TL;DR: I used a market order on a stonk that was mooning and bought it for 15x the ask price. By some JPOW money printing miracle my broker convinced the market makers to change the trade and I got 90% of my money back. 

Takeaways for everyone: 

1) If I were using Robin Hood I would most certainly be out all that money. Use a real broker and pay the commission fees for your trades, you never know when it might save you. 

2) Always do limit orders. I’m sure someone out there will be happy to tell me why a market order could be better in some situations, but you can go fuck yourself cuz I’ll never do it again. 

3) Buy DGLY calls and help me get the rest of my money back. 

I hope you all enjoyed my saga, I look forward to reading the comments. Happy trading everyone.",394,So you were the guy 😂,"Market makers have pretty wide latitude to fill market orders at ""reasonable"" prices; this is why you should never put in a market order. However, in your buddy's case, this fill was at a plainly unreasonable price. The market makers who filled it probably decided to reverse figuring the cost of a likely FINRA/SEC case against them would be higher than eating the trade.

Edit: If you ever get destroyed by a bad market order, talk to your broker first, maybe you will get lucky like this guy. Then if that doesn't work call up the SEC and FINRA, they may be able to help (don't bother though unless you paid more than double the security's going rate).

stocks,wallstreetbets,"About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks.","https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-data-show-359-million-144445943.html

SEC Data Show $359 Million of GameStop Shares Failed to Deliver
(Bloomberg) -- On Jan. 28, the day after GameStop Corp. mania hit its crescendo on the back of a short squeeze for the record books, about $359 million worth of shares were caught in limbo.

More than 1 million shares were deemed failed-to-deliver that day due either to buyers lacking cash to complete purchases or sellers not having the shares to settle trades, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data.

The SEC report, which covers trading from Jan. 15 through the end of the month, is just one more indication of the dislocation in the market for the video game retailer’s shares.

GameStop stock, for months among the most heavily shorted on the New York Stock Exchange, surged more than 1,700% from Jan. 1 through Jan. 27 as a legion of Reddit users piled on, forcing bearish traders to scramble for shares and brokers to take the highly unusual step of curbing trading.

While the SEC’s list highlights the extent of the short squeeze, on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, where the GameStop trade was galvanized, it’s evidence of something else: the unproven theory that hedge funds were engaged in naked short-selling of the shares.

Short sales -- when an investor borrows shares, sells them and then tries to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference -- are an everyday market occurrence. Naked short selling, the illegal practice of selling shares that aren’t known to exist, is just one possible cause of a failure-to-deliver, with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays.

“Fails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales,” reads a disclaimer on the SEC website. “Therefore, fails-to-deliver are not necessarily the result of short selling, and are not evidence of abusive short selling or ‘naked’ short selling.”

Failures to deliver can result in fines, losses as well as reputational harm, and in rare circumstances there’s also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity.

One thing is clear: the Grapevine, Texas-based company is an anomaly in the data. Ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldn’t be delivered -- a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of GameStop’s shares -- it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top 10 during the period. And it was only one of two companies, the other being Li Auto Inc., to feature atop a list dominated by exchange-traded funds.

The data, which is released twice a month, tracks securities that had at least 10,000 shares that failed-to-deliver on a daily basis. The total number of shares for each day is a “cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,” according to the SEC’s website.

Does it reach a point where they are obligated to pay or just keep getting fined until they do?

This is money that should be heading back to the taxpayer and stockholder, yet we most likely don’t get a cut of any of the restitution from the negligence...

year,wallstreetbets,2024 is a year for the U.S. Presidential Election and is historically a bullish year for stocks,"* S&P 500 is up 75% of the time during a U.S. Presidential Election year with a solid  average return of 7.5% and an even stronger median return of 10.7% over the 24 cycles  from 1928 through 2020. This is in line with the historical average and median returns for the SPX, but Year 4 is more likely to be up than the average year   

* Outliers are very rare. 1932 and 1940 had big outlier months for the SPX – both to the upside and to the downside – during Presidential Cycle Year 4. Only three months had SPX declines of 20% or more: April 1932, May 1932 and May 1940. Two months had SPX rallies greater than 30%: July and August 1932. The last outlier was 83 years ago and it was good for the market.  

* Even if you exclude 2024 being a presidential election year, cooling inflation and more dovish monetary policy should help stocks next year.

I know GME AMC and CLOV are not the same and I am not here to bash either GME or AMC just pointing out some similarities between the three. I support GME both AMC and GME. Full disclosure I am not the first to point out these similarities but I have looked into them myself using the charts I pulled off of the SEC Website. AL Trades is where I first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and I just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided. 

Looking at the Charts you see peaks in FTDs in Both GME and AMC before the price run up. **FOR GME HAPPENED 3 TIMES and THE FTD PATTERN HAS AN ERIE CORRELATION THE SHARE PRICE IMO.** 

The Peak FTDs for GME were just over 3m and GMEs Float is 56m according to Google

3m FTDs / 56m Shares = just over 5% of the float 

The Peak FTDs for AMC were just over 27M and the float according to google is 511m

27m FTDs / 511m Shares = Just over 5% of the Float 

The Peak FTDs for CLOV were just over 19m and the Float according to Google is 133M

19m FTD’s / 133m Shares = **Just over 14%**!

Another thing I want to point out is that AMC before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from CLOV in June. 

AMC went from around $2 to $20 then back down to $6 

CLOV went from $6 to $28 and is now in the $8 range which it has been for a couple of weeks now. Is the Bottom in for CLOV? I don’t really know but I hope so. 

**Full disclosure I am a CLOV shareholder and very bullish on CLOV from all of My research I have done and that others have done.** 

**I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. Just pointing out some things I see from the Charts.** 

**I hope that everybody does they’re own due diligence before investing and hope that everybody makes some money investing.** 

**If you don’t like this post, please provide some constructive feedback and specific reasons why.** 

**Last but not least LFG GME AMC AND CLOV.**",440,"I don’t have anything against CLOV, in fact I made profits in its first run. However, I don’t think this TA is statistically sound. There are 3000 stocks that have FD data and price correlation that will not show this pattern. Cherry picking GME and AMC as examples does not paint an accurate picture.",Why did CLOV s FTD skyrocketed even though when price was going a bit down or not moving ?,CLOV is the only one that has not had a huge run yet just a small run to 28 like AMC had in JAN. It’s been hovering around 8 for four weeks now and every time it try’s to breakout it’s to the upside. It was up over 20% before the ladder attack. CLOV is ready for a big breakout.
stock price,wallstreetbets,"$wish discussion , will earnings catapult or drop stock price valuation? -ContextLogic Inc. (d/b/a Wish) (NASDAQ: WISH), announced it will report its second quarter 2021 financial results after the close of market on Thursday, August 12,","
I honestly believe that next $WISH context Logic ER on august 12th will be bad and miss estimates, we will see a possible dip.

However I also strongly believe that it will be the last bad ER , following ER’s should beat or be in line with estimates , professional investors know it, the stock could dip but is strongly expected to pick up upward momentum one or two days after ER.

This being said, I’m not taking the risk of selling my position now at these valuations, if for some reason considerable investing vehicles , WSB retail investors strike early or earnings is according to estimates , I don’t want to be missing the boat for the sole purpose of potentially loading up an earnings mis dip that might or might not happen.

The MAU’s number for sure will show a continued decrease this quarter , however the recent strong moves , opening new positions cross boarder and adding 100 000’s of new merchants internationally , will start to show in following ER’s (Q3 & following). Adding a new cfo in the near future, welcoming new cfo targets and guidance , increase in global e-commerce traffic , after dealing with the lockup expiration set backs, will support the way back up. Potential upside is massive , downside is marginal imo.

What is for sure : some hectic weeks ahead for $WISH, be smart with you’re decisions, let me know what you think. Glta

trading,wallstreetbets,I am never trading options again,"This was the original title and post I wrote up before the events of Thursday transpired. Everything in quotes was written by past me: 

""I’ve disabled options trading. I will dump all my money into blue chips and index funds. I’ve just made 100k over a span of 3 days. 

[The contracts gained more value, but I didn't screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/m6328lnwazxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a795f81624d5e6cd1fe43471261a27692664af)

The screen shots are incomplete because I was trying to sell quick. It’s about 100k profit when you factor in I lost 60k entering the trade on shorter dated puts. 

I’m going to be completely candid. Whether that gets me banned or not, I will take that risk. 

From the moment I uttered this comment, I set fourth the most regarded scheme in history. 

[When I decided to hold until recivership ](https://preview.redd.it/hgp4xiumdzxa1.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=9577ebc5463dacf10930ba6fc247f670d1757060)

At the time, FRC hadn’t halted trading. I reached out to Robinhood support to get their stance on what would happen during a halt. I didn’t show the full conversation, but they were extremely unclear. They said that I would be short if I exercised, but I’d have a hard time covering that short position. Although this is not saying yes or no, it’s definitely terrible communication on their part. 

A lawsuit based on the hypothetical scenario we discussed is a complete long shot. Out of curiosity, I asked a lawyer that day. They said I was likely to win if Robinhood backed out but they needed more details. I did not trust this scummy lawyer. I had another option. [Robinhood had previously cracked to social media pressure and allowed people to exercise puts into a short position.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/03/16/robinhood-bends-to-pressure-and-permits-short-selling-to-replace-put-options-on-signature-bank/?sh=6a7e783c2312) They have a history of bending to social media backlash. There’s even this disclaimer when stocks are halted: 

[This is directly from backlash on Reddit when they disabled the buy button. ](https://preview.redd.it/hmv5lc8jbzxa1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e03b956c1bb8cc242788f12d541215efbf27d44)

I thought I could increase the odds by creating viral posts about Robinhood’s misdeeds. Hopefully Robinhood would crack knowing their name was being smeared on the front page of Reddit. WSB backing me would have been helpful but not necessary. I just needed to make noise. 

I believed the chances I could cash out were high to begin with. I was sort’ve right. Multiple brokers allowed exercising into a short. Just not Robinhood. They still may have made an exception, as their support told me multiple times it “might” happen. But I wasn’t about to wait till expiration without a fight. 

Within the quest to fight Robinhood, I made this bet: 

[The fateful ban bet](https://preview.redd.it/a7vosyp6azxa1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7fae27f31c7a2a414df81c845c96d931e7c0e6b)

Robinhood did not allow short selling for FRC put holders as the terms of the bet demanded. I sold the contracts instead of exercising. \[Based on the terms of the bet I do not have to pay anything. I still planned on donating a few thousand until yesterday.\]

Whether this scheme would have worked, I guess we’ll never know. FRC began trading OTC and exercising was not necessary anymore. 

Despite being correct, I’ve taken up a reckless unsustainable trading approach. If I continue on this path, I will lose everything. I’ve seen it so many times where someone makes a very intelligent correct trade, then starts thinking they’re a trading genius. They start making reckless bets in things they have no business buying. This is an extremely slippery slope for me. I’ve blown up multiple accounts and I refuse to make the same mistake. I hope I can set an example- don’t keep rolling the dice. Take the money and run. 

I know it’s very obvious to everyone; cashing out is the smart thing to do. But in my position the rush of euphoria from a massive win like this is intoxicating. The sobering despair of previous losses melts away. It’s very hard to fight the imaginative ideas of becoming a multimillionaire and retiring under 30. I hope I can set an example and inspire others to break the gambling cycle. Hopefully, I will be able to maintain self control, but the urge to make one more bet is always there. I refuse let myself squander this life altering amount of money.""

**PRESENT MOMENT:**

I saw PACW tanking after hours based on news that they were looking for sellers. They had already said this in their ER that they were looking to sell assets. I felt the drop overblown fear from FRCs collapse. 

I bought when it was at $2.90 but because I didn’t put a limit order in RH averaged purchase price was fucking $3.40 my god. Immediate 40k loss.

[Paper handed while it was dumping after Robinhood's shitty payment for order flow bought the shares at an inflated price. ALWAYS SET LIMIT ORDERS](https://preview.redd.it/4oshkmswbzxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9875c83b56c10d33360ae3f29904aa82b15012e)

 Then I think to myself: PACW’s drop is not completely overblown. The need to shore up liquidity is bad in this environment and a recovery is higher risk. So I thought, let me buy a regional that is being pulled down just because everything is tanking: FHN. 

The TD CEO firmly stated they were committed to buying FHN. So any massive drop has huge upside. Surely TD wouldn’t back out of the deal 8 hours after I go all in. 

[I sold around 9.70, still lost a ton, but this loss wasn't fully realized](https://preview.redd.it/uu66q2n6czxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=a72df7c25b41d92c98a20335ab656d421f3c6cdb)

I am completely spiraling into whirlpool of gambling and degeneracy. I am trying to control myself. I lost another 50k yesterday and made it back just as quick. I'm playing with fire and I'm foolishly dead set on making back what I've lost. I've finally found an amazing risk reward trade to make all my money back plus profit. Selling WAL puts. I still stand by the idea that this current panic in regionals is far overblown. WAL especially is nothing like FRC and its odds of collapse are extraordinarily low. Currently selling $12 puts for a huge premium while that stock is at $20, this is a very safe bet to make back everything. I will roll into the $2.5 puts for an even safe bet. IV is at 500%, this is almost free money. WAL is not like FRC, even if PACW falls, WAL will be ok. 

[Everything is riding on WAL surviving. Very safe bet in my opinion.](https://preview.redd.it/5z83n0mzczxa1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36ee99b374712bc3617a4cb469e7f0a5f27595ab)

Then I can finally end this nightmare, quit the gambling and move on with my life. No more sleepless nights, no more insane schemes. I will finally come out on top and follow my original intentions after I made out on FRC. I am jumping into a wild ape cage posting this. I am revealing myself to be a reckless fool to the millions that believe I owe an Autism charity $10k. The internet is brutal, do with me what you will.",2472,"""I'm never trading options again""

trading,wallstreetbets,AI Trading. Is it possible?,"I should probably be asking this in a computer oriented subreddit but it's a computer / stock market question, and this is my favorite subreddit. So I'll start my journey here.

We've all heard of AI, right? Well I have, anyways I stumbled across a Youtube channel named 3Blue1Brown. He creates educational content mostly on the subject of math and computers. He has a series on neural networks, after watching each video multiple times I decided to give it a shot myself. In his videos he covers a feed-forward neural network that he trains to recognize hand-drawn numbers. I did it. I recreated exactly what he explained in the videos in Java and was able to successfully recognize a hand-drawn number 0-9 with ""Good enough"" accuracy. This got me looking for my next project, predict with ""Good enough"" accuracy which direction SPY was headed tomorrow and by how much (Seems like the logical next step right?). Immediately I ran into problems, historical market data is near impossible to get my hands on to try to train this neural network. I ended up downloading historical data on Yahoo Finance but it only includes data such as day high/ day low/ close price and volume. Long story short my AI didn't work. This got me wondering if it's even possible. One of the very obvious reasons it didn't work is I need more data. I'm thinking I need at least level 2 market data and would like to keep tabs on the options market as well. Is there anywhere I can go to download historical data like this? And if not, I'm thinking I'll just have to pay for live market data and have a simple program make notes of all the action that happens for at least a couple years (Probably host something like this on Google Cloud for 100% uptime).  
But let's say I have the data. Is it possible any of this even works with any kind of accuracy? Should I be using something other than a feed-forward neural network? Any input is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR I want to get rich and I want my computer to tell me how to do it",6,No Advertising/Self Promo. Please review the rules,"I made myself an LSTM neural network to try automatically trade crypto and no matter how much data I trained it on (days, months, years), or how ""deep"" my model was (number of layers, nodes per layer, epochs trained, etc) the model always just predicted the price would go down when the price was trending up and the price would go up when the price was trading down. It felt like the model took a ""it'll always revert to the mean"" mindset that just can't take into account the ""randomness"" of the market. This was done using crypto which in my mind should have even more ""algorithmic"" patterns than stocks. Do with this info what you may but I haven't had luck personally.","I think you'll be more successful if you do Modern Portfolio management and ETFs: Bonds, Indexes, gold and Silver. Include factors like PE and inflation. 

This is already a proven strategy. What you can do is perhaps optimize ist even further dor youself. 10% per year is plenty. All the rest is people that end up here with a red screen shot sooner or later."

trading,wallstreetbets,I've been trading for almost 2 years now and lost everything 4 times.,"Hi guys! I decided to share my story with you because none of my friends irl trade or invest their money so they don't understand how it is possible to lose it so fast. (I didn't lose big numbers because I'm from Poland)

**RUN I**

So my first what I like to call a ""RUN"" started 2 years ago when I was in high school. I worked through the summer of 2020 and made a couple of grand. As a rational 16 y/o I decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me for I am more ambitious that the rest of the society, oh how wrong I was. I started with trading what I thought were stock (CFDs) with fixed 20x leverage. As you could predict after 2 months of trading I lost everything and got depressed, completely neglected school and made the worst decision of my life, got into crypto.

**RUN II**

So in 2021 I bought a gaming laptop with rtx3060 and heard you can make some money by mining crypto. At the time I thought crypto was I scam, but hey, who says no to free money right? So after mining it I thought that it is such a waste for it to just sit in my wallet and started trading with it (don't fucking do it). I got rugged in crypto more time than I can count. Every single project that I got into was a scam, tried some airdrop hunting but all I got from it was 2 USDT and 1 coin that I decided to hold and it went from $100 to $0.05. Lost everything again.

**RUN III**

So we fast forward to 2022, my 18th birthday so I get a lot of money from my family and friends. And as a young and ambitious man I decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me (again!) and put 50% of my life savings into a certain crypto ponzi called Time Wonderland. And of course as a young and ambitious man I decided that mere spot holding is beneath and used leverage (please don't do this). After 3 days there was a massive liquidation of founder of the said ponzi and I got liquidated. Lost half of the money I got for my birthday in 3 just 3 fucking days. After that I decided to quit crypto and went back to trading CFDs. Longed the shit out of DAX 2 days before Russia attacked Ukraine and lost the other half of the money.

**RUN IV (the last one so far)**

So I live in Poland and we border Russia and after the war in Ukraine started, our government started a REALLY good marketing campaign of the military forces. So after finishing high school and being a broke degenerate I decided to join the army. Fast forward next month I get my first military salary and go back to trading. After losing everything in crypto 2 times I decided that the lessons were learnt and it's time to make it all back. Summer 2022 Ethereum goes up from $1000 to $2000 due to the merge narrative. Shorted the shit out of it at the beginning of September with 20x leverage and made like $10k (more than the average yearly salary in my country). That's actually the only time when I made a lot of money. Than shorted another coin (don't even remember the name, just dumb fucking luck) and made another $10k, all in the span of one week. And after making what a the time for me was a life changing money I decided to yolo it all trading altcoins with high leverage, lost almost everything by the and of September 2022. Lost my last pennies in FTX crash trying to long their token, I know it's really fucking stupid, I also longed LUNA during the crash, I'm just really bad at trading.

**RUN V, when ??**

So right now I study Computer Science and accumulate money to make it all turbo back trading, I know I don't learn any lessons I'm a gambler. I really love trading and want to do this for the rest of my life but feel like I'm addicted to it. Sometimes when I was about to get liquidated I would stare at the charts an literally pray (even though I'm atheist) not to get to.

What do I do? Should I stop or keep grinding and just hope to get lucky?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE I:**

The fifth run is going to happen sooner than later, I think I will start with $1k and (hopefully) get to $10k. If not than I will have some loses to flex!

Will cover it on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbos6pEFBmkObxAqFwwlvcw)

**UPDATE II:**

I'm currently long $LINK, you may want to countertrade me, I'm very bad at it.

trading,wallstreetbets,"Bull, Bear, Or Something Else? Define Your Entire Trading Identity With This Helpful List Of Animals","From bears to bulls and everything in between, aligning your market strategy with an animal is an easy way to stop thinking and start winning. Why stay agile in variable market conditions when a singular thesis works just as well? Whether you feel directionless, despairing, or just angry at the Federal Reserve, we have the animal to represent you:


1. **Bear Gang** – A relic of the Wall Street where men were men and companies had to earn money. Adherence to bear philosophy comes with a natural self-righteousness in the confidence that western civilization is an unsustainable debt bubble. Just a few more coronavirus deaths and you’ll be content, you promise. You lose money, but you’re morally right.


2. **Bull Gang** – Your only regret is that you didn’t buy more. You sleep well at night because you are invested in the engine of the country you love. Your faith is rewarded when stocks only go up. Your wife may not love you for your intelligence, but she’ll be content with taking half of the investment account in fifteen years.


3. **Kangaroo Gang** – Thriving on market volatility, adherence to the principles of the Kang Gang means that you attempt to execute multi-legged options strategies. No matter which direction the underlying stock moves, you’ll still lose to the computers who do it better. Like a kangaroo, you’ll bounce right out of this gang when you fully realize that profits are capped and you’re too poor to give up gambling so young.


4. **Sloth Gang** – If you hadn’t slept through market open, you might have made a really good play today. You’re sitting mostly in cash, because nothing is a sure thing. Often, you hover over the limit buy button until the price of the underlying moves up (and becomes too expensive) or down (that was probably the top). Even though you rarely ever make moves, you still hang around every day. 


5. **Tortoise Gang** – You invested your pension in a broad index of stocks fifty years ago. You never came close to paying the taxes that you’ve taken out in social security. You’ve been receiving deliveries of physical gold bullion for years to better weather the downturn that won’t come until after you’re dead. At least your offspring will provide liquidity in the options market for a time with their inheritance.


6. **Housefly Gang** – Persistent, annoying, and attracted to whatever excrement the market dumps out, you breed freely in the corpses of Hertz, Ford, and JCP. You are numerous, but never alive for long.


7. **Vampire Bat Gang** – Known commonly as Theta Gang outside of the taxonomic hierarchy, you gain from siphoning the profits of other gangs. Your toxic presence is a carrier for harmful options that infect bulls and bears alike. You are perfectly content to bide your time in the shadows, clinging to large outcroppings of capital. You might eventually sell naked and get turned into soup.


8. **Opossum Gang** – Primarily nocturnal, you feed on futures and pre-market movements from Tokyo to Frankfurt. You’ll eventually end up run over and dead on the side of the road, which is an excellent indicator for other gangs to trade on.


9. **White Rhino Gang** – Still technically alive but teetering on the brink of extinction, your account is down 99% all-time after getting blown up by a play on a Chinese stock nobody remembers. After the Reddit upvotes fade, you’ll still be there. Alone, and with no hope for the future.


10. **Yang Gang** – All you ever wanted was the Coronavirus stimulus checks, but with fewer steps.

A: You sure can, and theta gang will thank you for it. See: theta, liquidity, delta. You will lose.

2. Is (insert generic meme RH ticker) a good option to buy? (Note they don’t mention call/put or strike)
A: Quit polluting our sub and do your own research. There are so many books and videos you may never finish all the resources.

3. I have $3k to blow, what should I spend it on?
A: See 2, also odd flex but ok.

4. Options trading is so easy, how do you guys even lose money lol?
A: First one (or two, maybe three) is free. I’ll be on the winning end of your trade before you know it, rookie.

5. What is a call (or a put)?
A: A way to donate money to theta gang. Seriously I’m all for answering questions but I can’t handle this dumb shit that google can answer in 10 seconds.

Edit: We (theta gang) sell calls or puts to poor suckers and profit. When you lose, we win. When you win (less often), we lose.

However, market value is dictated by supply and demand, simple as that. If a lot of people want a stock -> stock goes up.

My first thought would be to buy as many ITM calls as I could afford either on Monday or the Friday prior, then sell them when the stock reaches the predestined price. 

My question is, is there any other financial instrument, a strategy involving options, or a combination of both that would allow me to maximize  my profits from this price increase?",65,"

underlying stock price,wallstreetbets,"Preparing for the possibility of a 1/29 squeeze - the importance of a solid sell wall, holding the line, and avoiding prisoners' dilemma cascading sell offs.","Alright boys and girls we've made it to a pretty critical stage here. Tomorrow we face the possibility of a massive squeeze fueled by short coverage and the inevitable gamma squeeze that will come from thousands of call contracts being exercised. Some things to note - MMs buy 95% of the underlying shares represented by call contracts to hedge each time they're bought; as we've seen in the past few days, in this case MMs are almost the same 'group' as the shorts. This throws a wrench in things that I don't know how to interpret. Anyone? They worked together today to lock us out, tank the price, and make a 100 million dollar short sale while liquidating massive share quantities at a price so low it margin called anyone holding that many shares on margin in the first place. We can expect buy lockouts and other bullshit but the gamma squeeze remains **inevitable**. The gamma squeeze will not necessarily lead to or indicate the short squeeze happening, no one knows. It seems like the most important thing each investor has to prepare for on their own is an exit strategy for call contracts expiring tomorrow (regardless of squeeze height) and shares (in the case of the actual squeeze happening) if that investor wants to sell.

As has been explained here a few times now, shorts need our shares - period. Tomorrow they will buy shares and they will buy contracts to convert into shares. They must meet the prices we set - again, period. Hypothetically, if every single person that is HOLDING shares set the sell limit to 10K (which RH now prevents as an 'aggressive' limit), then shorts would have no option but to pay that price if they want to cover OR - and this is important - they CAN WAIT FOR HOLDERS TO DEFECT AND SELL EARLY, UNDERCUTTING THE SELL WALL. The **prisoners' dilemma** describes the problem of achieving maximal collective outcomes in situations where individual self-interest comes into play. In the event of a squeeze, all holders will be faced with the question of when to sell. Even if a sell wall was established by 95% of holders at 1K, if 5% of holders create sell orders at 500, the shorts will purchase all of those, and then someone holding at 1K (in the original 95%) says 'fuck, I don't want to miss out' and lowers their price to 600. Let's say 5% of that group holding at 1K does that. Now 90% of the holders are still at 1K but 10% of all shares have now been sold at or below 600. This would cascade and bring the price down.

We are NOT a hedge fund or a hive mind and there is no way to ensure we all sell at the same time and I am not telling anybody when to sell. This is all entirely hypothetical. I'm not encouraging a specific price point 🤷‍♂️ I'm merely describing a predicament we face - a market phenomenon, perhaps. Right now if you look at the GME order book, the sell 'wall' looks like a staircase, moving upwards at a pretty natural slope. That kind of sell wall will not produce the optimal collective outcome in terms of sale price in the case of a squeeze. In that scenario, the actual sale prices would likely never reach the top. What **would** produce the optimal group outcome is a true sell wall, where limit orders are **FLAT** until a **massive Kingdom of the Fucking North Wall** at a single price. Thoughts? I personally just love the fucking stock. Play with the bull you get the fucking horns.

EDIT: [https://imgur.com/gallery/wLMohne](https://imgur.com/gallery/wLMohne) this is the current sell staircase versus a sell wall. NONE of this post is financial advice. I'm just a retard drawing in my notes app.

stock market crash,wallstreetbets,Imminent Stock Market Crash,"My thesis has several layers which provides a margin of safety ;

1. Fed policy: Currently the fed is tapering and has said that if inflation persist they may increase the speed they taper. If you look at history every single time the fed tapered the market corrects (20+%). The same can be said when they Fed announces they are increasing QE, the market reverses a downtrend and continues on a bull run. This has proven to be 100% accurate in the US. The market is forward looking and sees this coming, IMO the market has already topped. Of course the Fed could reverse there decision and decide to continue QE for longer, if this occurs I will cover my short.
2. Stocks under pressure: ARKK ETF and the vast majority of speculative stocks are down 50-70%, these are the first to be hit when we extend to the end of a bull run, and the stock market participants are looking for a safe, cash flowing companies to ride into the end, that is essentially a flight to safety in anticipation of tapering and an increase in the funds rate.
3. Fed announced Taper: On November 3rd the fed announced the taper, since then we've seen stocks get smashed on any miss earnings and just the way the market is reacting to news has drastically changed. Most recent example is the new C19 variant, any potential bad news the market is no longer just brushing off, participants are confused and see the market as being irrational for no reason, where in fact the real reason is because of the TAPER. We will continue to see large draw downs on any negative news.
4. Valuation: The FAANG stocks is holding up this market, as they are seen as the safest and best companies the world. This has pushed there valuations to ALL time highs. MSFT is trading at a 37 PE and 14 PS, not seen since the Dot Com bubble. Normal MSFT or AAPL trade at a PE of 12-18 and that was during the last decade where they had a massive run rate of growth ahead of them.
5. Shift to small cap from large cap?: I have thought about the possibility of a shift away from large cap, allowing them to correct while small cap coming back into favour, keep the market propped up,  however EVERY SINGLE time MSFT has corrected or crashed the market does the same. So unless this is the first time we ever see this happen, It just isn't probable.
6. Forward guidance: AAPLE is only expected to grow at 4% in 2022, and MSFT 15ish%. Demand has been pulled forward and we are going to see a reset in their valuations based on forward looking guidance, currently it is completely unsustainable and they have no way to grow into there valuations.
7. Economic outlook: Inflation is rising which will put pressure on companies margins if they don't have pricing power. On top of this I expect we see a much weaker consumer in 2022/2023. The cost of living is rising significantly in every aspect of people's lives, leaving them with less disposable income to spend on non essentials. Any correction in the stock market or housing market would further pressure consumer confidence making them think twice about going on that vacation or buying a new Macbook etc..
8. China: The Chinese economy is on the brink of collapse, the real estate giants such as Evergrande are barely meeting payments on interest. Evergrande has 300 billion in debt and is selling assets to meet interest obligations. Real estate sales are down 30% in October! The Chinese see the inevitable real estate crash as these giant companies fail, which will cause the economy to collapse and will have a ripple affect on the world. China is the #1 purchaser of commodities from countries around the world, as their economy slows they will purchase less ,which will put pressure on other countries GDP,  we have already seen a massive slow down in China doing just this!
9. Market is currently crashing: The Russel 2000 peaked a couple weeks ago on November 8th and is already down 10%. In nearly ever case small cap lead a crash (not including black swan events) and the S&P follow behind within a matter of weeks. Also; technical analysis on the FAANG stocks all show they were extremely over extended and have peaked, which would be very consistent with the Russell leading the crash and 2 weeks later (now) the FAANG beginning their crash.   Thank you for reading. Please poke holes in this thesis and invest at your own risk.  Don't fight the FED, adapt to their policy.

stock market crash,wallstreetbets,Imminent Market Crash DD. Why I believe the U.S. stock market and U.S. Dollar will fall.,"This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn’t believe. I turned around and said “Sir… I’m sorry, what did you just say?” He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food…he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. 

So…when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at…I’m sure it’s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I’m not joking…**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn’t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew…we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1

After already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) 

I immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.

The dollar index after J. POW’s Jackson Hole Speech. 😂 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy

Now this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I’m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I paid for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.

                  Technical Analysis

Let me start with my TA first…which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX 

**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**

Here is one from Thursday, September 2.

https://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5

**$SPY is at a critical resistance level…I mean…it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**… and with everything going on in the world…you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble…but how was that even theoretically feasible? It’s impossible in my opinion. 

Let me explain why…

              Updated GDP Forecasts

**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret…THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**

For fuck sakes people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! 

**“The team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.”**

**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So…yeah we’re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie’s future earnings… and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now…** 

             Wall Street‘s High Expectations

So far, 88% of S and P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.

The strong results put the S and P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. 😳 So…. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings….which I guarantee that will happen… it’s going to be an earnings miss galore. 

                     Lumber/Gold Ratio

Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.

When gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.

**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**

This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.

Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ 

I like this one better compared to the DOW 30. 
https://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB

The lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months…literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember…play defense)

Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But…gold was up big this week as well…and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.

                Consumer Confidence

**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**

So…for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.

**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy…were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9….a very surprising miss. I wasn’t surprised at all to be honest with you.**


                      Conclusion

**Let me be clear…I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it’s going to collapse our financial system possibly…also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant “Mu” and mass evictions will soon begin…**

**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**

No big deal right? 


**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP

No big deal right?
**Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr**

**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi

No big deal right? 

**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on…. But you get the point by now…let’s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I’m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don’t get me started on the mass evictions as well…and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities… The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**

Now…**my positions.** Take this into consideration… I’m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So…**Not financial advice.** 

**Short term Tendies:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. 
$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold
$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold

Bought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp 

**Long term Tendies:**

One $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)
It basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks… I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. 

2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It’s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. 

1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)

One $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC 
Exp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I’m wrong) 

**My last position:**

**$2,500 in Cash.**

Simply put…**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies… my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me… I already have my shopping list ready. 

Good luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**…but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It’s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!

**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a “Black swan event”by purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars…Let me remind you that they deal with information.**

I’m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I’m saying that maybe it’s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don’t forget **Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1mil**…another bearish catalyst for the market. I literally could go on and on guys….It’s pretty obvious at this point, we’ll at least to me…but what do I know? I just got out of prison last December. 🤔

TLDR: Just read the bold shit…

options,wallstreetbets,Options Explained - A Quick Beginners Guide,"Fellow Bettors, if you understand options, move on.

First, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.

I've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.

As much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.

Depending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.

**Options Explained**

***The Basics***

Buying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).

* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.
* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.

Selling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.

* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.
* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.

***The Money***

For Calls:

* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.

For Puts:

* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised

***Calls Explained***

Buying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)

This is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.

* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised
* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money
* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even
* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent
* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars
* Price - Price of the option

In the above example:

* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.

The Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.

***Buying Calls***

Ok, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.
* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**
* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.

***Selling Naked Calls***

If you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)

Notice ""To Break Even"" turns into ""Chance of Profit.""  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.

**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.

***Puts Explained***

Buying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.

[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)

None of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.

* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised

***Buying Puts***

The 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.
* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.
* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.

***Selling Naked Puts***

If you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.

**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS ""CAPPED"" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**

***Options Pricing***

The price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.

* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|
   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value
   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price.
   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play
* Extrinsic Value
   * Effected by theta and implied volatility
   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value
   * Theta
      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.
      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE

https://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d

* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time
   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV.
   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.
   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.
   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.

***Do I Have to Hold to Expiration?***

Lets say we buy the $MSFT 12/31 $230.0C.  Do we have to wait until December 31? No.  If the underlying increases to lets say $225.0 by next Friday, 12/4, we could sell the option for likely a pretty good profit.  We payed $1.67 for the contract, but the price of the Call may increase to $3.67, so we could Sell to Close for a $200 profit, allowing us to move on to another trade.  But as we approach the strike delta increases and therefore may be worth holding.  The break even information is only if you intend to hold the call to expiration and profit from exercising and then immediately selling the shares back into the market.  Due to time and market craziness, I recommend taking profit from the option itself rather than exercising and using the shares.

***The Details***

Going back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774

This explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.

* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price
* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price
* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree
* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold
* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day
* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled

Bid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.

Open Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.

The lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.

***The Greeks***

You can see the Greeks listed above for this call.

* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.
* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.
* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.
* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.
* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.

market,wallstreetbets,How to beat the market,"Everyone knows the market is rigged, but I think I've figured out a way to beat it.

First off, you need to change your career. If you're fortunate enough to not be living off chicken tendies in your mom's basement, you are either gainfully employed, or have some crappy job in retail. Either way, you need to adjust. For the former, you will have to downgrade your career, and for the latter you are probably SOL either way so maybe stop reading now.

Now you need to become a teacher. But not just any teacher. You need to get into a nice Manhattan private school at around grades 5 through 8. Now once you're teaching these little rich kids Social Studies or what have you, you introduce the ""stock market"" game. We've all heard of it or done it when we were kids in school. You give the kids paper trading accounts, and whoever has the most money after a few months, wins.

Now the catch is that they all have hedge fund mommy and daddys that will be giving them sick stock tips so they win the candy jar at the end of the game. Now you take these stock tips from your students and fully leverage that on options with your measly teaching salary.

And that is how you beat the market.",12534,"

market,wallstreetbets,The Greatest Market Bubble of All Time. A Full Bear Counter-Thesis.,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zhh32rft3yi61.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dee34103f8ecdf4a758f94418f3f6c477e89644

**The more things change, the more they stay the same. There is nothing new under the sun.**

&#x200B;

In every market bubble, you always hear the same language, the same rationalizations, the same absurd arguments. These people think they are offering some new, unique insight... in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history. Let's address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis.

&#x200B;

**1) Interest rates are low. Nowhere for money to go except stocks.**

When you really drill down into it, this is some bizarre logic. It's essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable. In other words, it's a manifestation of the greedy, FOMO mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles.

Ultimately, these bull aren't even arguing that we aren't in a bubble. They are arguing we are in a bubble, but that the bubble is JUSTIFIED.

The obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a low-interest rate environment. What's the worst that can happen if I sit on a pure cash portfolio? I lose \~2% per year. Not good, of course, but not the end of the world either. What's the worst that can happen if I dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes? I lose 50%+ of my funds in as little as a month. Ouch.

The idea that I'm forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing 2% a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset.

Of course, the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply won't crash... or, that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious. But the whole point is that the crash is never obvious, especially to permabulls. They see a dip, and they buy it. They see a deeper dip, what a great opportunity, so they buy more. And before they realize the dip isn't simply a dip, they are already fucked. Tale as old as time.

The funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment, no matter how irrational. Why hold cash when bonds pay more? Why buy bonds when index funds pay more? Why buy index funds when SPACS pay more? Why buy SPACS when flipping cocaine pays more? After all, if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible, since it loses to inflation, what sort of high risk investment can you not justify?

What's most interesting is that this argument isn't even new. The ridiculously low interest rates set by the Fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the 2008 crash. The Fed is ultimately a bubble creator, something even WSB is well aware of...

**2) If you sit out this rally you will end up behind, even if you are right.**

This is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls. They argue that if you sat out the last 10 months (something this is essentially a straw man argument, except in reference to perma-bears), then you would have missed out on massive gains. And therefore, the implicit argument is, you can NEVER sit out.

If you carefully analyze this argument, you will realize it is literally nothing more than FOMO to the extreme. It's Fear Of Missing Out disguised as macroeconomic theory. I have to stay in the market perpetually, I can never sit out, because if I do I will MISS OUT on gains. And you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too, dummy!

First of all, I will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately perma-bears. People who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains. But not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are perma-bears. There are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble, and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out, they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed.

An intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear. They adapt to the market. And when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market, you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid perma-bear. The bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them, but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out.

&#x200B;

Let's take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history.

&#x200B;

**Major Indicators of the Great Bubble**

&#x200B;

**1) MASSIVE retail investment. Worldwide.**

What are some signs of bubbles, historically? Well, a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market. Do we have that today? CHECK, on fucking steroids. We've got people who can't change a fucking tire on their 2008 Civic downloading Robinhood and gambling options on margin. Like WTF?

The 80 IQ mongoloid who was washing dishes at Papa Johns last Tuesday (do they even have dishes? I don't fucking know) is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking China or some shit. Are you kidding me? Do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching?

Not to mention the entire short-squeeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire... Now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in Bangladesh is downloading Robinhood to buy calls on fucking SNDL or whatever the fuck.

Past US market bubbles were largely restricted to the US population. It was mostly Americans buying American stocks during the dotcom boom. But wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized. Now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into Tesla at a 1,300 PE ratio. What's that noise? Is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance?

The ""Max Pain"" theory (which is ironically popular among permabulls) argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors. This is of course bullshit, but it's food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo.

https://preview.redd.it/7r7kv00v3yi61.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d74d856187f569d73e04c47746f4a8bd16f700c

**2) Ridiculously speculative ""investments."" AKA SPACs.**

CCIV is worth 15 billion dollars. And it owns literally nothing. No deal is in place, no announced deal figures have been offered, obviously the SPAC has no earnings or revenue to speak of... just 15 billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium. I can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed.

What is a SPAC, at the end of the day? A rich guy steps up and says ""give me your money, and I'll decide what I'll do with it in a few months...""

And a million retards step up and say ""SOUNDS GREAT!!! TAKE MY MONEY!!!""

Tell me this SPAC shit isn't exactly like the dotcom boom, when literally anything with a .com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the ""hot new thing."" There is no way this SPAC mania lasts, and lots of people will be hurt in the end.

https://preview.redd.it/mhof6o3w3yi61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b9623780a63517644627087106c2d2078950e7b

**3) Options volume absolutely exploding.**

Options are becoming the vehicle of choice for ""investors"" AKA gamblers in the current market. Stock represents actual ownership of a company, the foundation of the actual market. But what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term? I just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker.

The question I sometimes ask is how much of this market ""growth"" is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume. You know, like derivative CDO's leveraging worthless mortgages back in 2008? It's something to think about.

I'll just leave this chart here, since it makes the case for me. This is neither natural nor sustainable.

**4) ""Greater Fool"" logic.**

I'll just quote investopedia since I'm getting lazy here...

""The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.

""If acting in accordance with the greater fool theory, an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality. If the theory holds, the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another “greater fool,” who could also be hoping to flip them quickly. Unfortunately, speculative bubbles burst eventually, leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices.

""The greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances, as well, including economic recessions and depressions. In 2008, when investors purchased faulty mortgage-backed securities, it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed.""

Basically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy. Nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value. This is talking about you.

**5) Buffet Indicator through the roof.**

The Buffet Indicator has reach it's highest ever level. For noobies who don't know what this means, the Buffett Indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by US GDP. A very high Buffett Indicator suggests an overvalued market, and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom.

There are two arguments against the Buffett Indicator as a useful metric. The first argument is that GDP is a backward indicator and therefore doesn't account for future growth. While this is true, it misses the entire point. The point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles. The point is to tie market valuations to some real-world metric, which is necessarily backward looking.

The other argument against the Buffett Indicator, which holds more weight, is that US stocks consist of global companies and therefore aren't adequately represented by US GDP.

I will say these people have a good point, but they are also missing several nuances within GDP and market valuations, which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post. Suffice it to say the Buffett Indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation, and can't simply be discarded.

**6) Valuations divorced from reality.**

During every major bubble, people like to come up with new, fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company. Back in the dotcom boom, companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of ""eyes."" That is, the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website.

This internet thing was a ""New Paradigm"" and so obviously we needed New Metrics to determine how valuable these companies were. Needless to say, the vast majority of these companies, many of them worth millions, were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight.

Take your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation. I like to pick on Tesla, personally, because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun.

**7) Fed Manipulation.**

Most bubbles have been created by Federal Reserve control of currency and interest rates. This market is no different. They create a bubble, and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new, bigger bubble, until that pops, and so on. It's like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house.

The catch is interest rates can't drop below zero. I mean, they can... But who wants to be Japan for the rest of history?

Alright I've written enough already and I won't write a whole thesis on Fed action and its consequences for now global markets. I'll just leave this pic here.

share price,wallstreetbets,"Sir Isaac Newton secretly wrote about GME, and was a 💎🙌 💪🦍 who gave us a target share price","Isaac Newton is known as being one of the biggest smart smarts in history. 

But did you know he secretly wrote about the GME rocket ship in his work ""*Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*"", 297 years before Gamestop was founded?

&#x200B;

That means ***he was even smarter than we thought***, and here's the proof:

&#x200B;

𝕹𝖊𝖜𝖙𝖔𝖓'𝖘 𝕷𝖆𝖜 𝖔𝖋 𝖀𝖓𝖎𝖛𝖊𝖗𝖘𝖆𝖑 𝕲𝖗𝖆𝖛𝖎𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓 (𝓣𝓱𝓮 𝓐𝓹𝓮 𝓛𝓪𝔀)

Newton stated that there was a universal law of gravity, and many interpreted his writings as a way to calculate the force of gravity on Earth.

Looking at his equations, they assumed he was speaking of things like mass, radii, and acceleration: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

They took this to mean that the gravitational constant of Earth was 9.8 m/s² and thought that they were the equally smart smarts for understanding Newton's work:

>gₑ = (6.67 \* 10⁻¹¹ N•m²/kg²)(6.0\*10²⁴ kg(/(6.4\*10⁶m)²  
>  
>gₑ = 9.8 m/s²

&#x200B;

However, while this interpretation was heralded as a breakthrough in physics, it was WRONG, and they were actually 𝕭𝖎𝖌 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇𝖘 who misunderstood what Newton was saying.

To understand what he really meant by the equation: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

We have to do a bit of re-arranging, because he didn't want his secret code to be found out too easily:

>GMₑ= gₑ \* Rₑ²

&#x200B;

Next, we have to change the little ""ₑ's and g's"" to big ""E's and G's"" since Newton wasn't a small minded hedgie:

>GME = GE \* RE²

&#x200B;

See what that says??? [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/)

&#x200B;

Newton's target price for GME was the price of GE, multiplied by the squared price of Everest Re Group Ltd (Ticker: RE).

&#x200B;

That gives us a target price for GME of:

>GME = $13.01 \*  $243.29²  
>  
>***GME = $770,062***

&#x200B;

So there you have it, Newton's secret code has been given to us. 

&#x200B;

His Law of Universal Gravitation was never about forces that would pull things down to Earth, it was about things that would rocket past the moon  [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)

share price,wallstreetbets,$COIN: $150B ($570/share) Price Target,"TLDR:

* $COIN collects revenue on trading USD VOLUME not asset prices. More trading, buying, *and* selling = more revenue
* Each cycle has introduced a new volume range
* Paypal's and Square's (and Affirm's) valuation indicate the markets are willing to price fintech at large multiples

We can readily compare $COIN against Paypal and Square: they all offer peer-to-peer payment solutions, are involved in the currency space, and offer exchange services. While, PYPL and SQ both offer more established merchant solutions that's not to discredit $COIN's efforts in enabling businesses to accept currency via its 'commerce' service, which could become popular as opinions and usage continue to increase favorably.

$COIN's [Q1 Numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/coinbase-reports-estimated-q1-revenue-of-1point8-billion-up-nine-fold.html)

* $1.8 Billion Revenue
* $800 Million Profit
* 56 Million users

Using these numbers, we can approximate the annual numbers:

* $7.2 Billion Annual Revenue
* $3.2 Billion Annual Profit

**This is making 2 quite large assumptions:**

1. Quarterly revenue is not seasonal -- revenues from Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 are approximately equivalent
2. Revenue is *sustained* \-- revenue is not dependent on asset prices, but rather trading volume. More on this later

^(2) While a 20.8 PS ratio may seem rich, this would be within reason of Affirm's [25.7 PS Ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/AFRM/ps_ratio)

# ^ Assuming that revenue streams are sustainable and continue to grow, there's no reason why $COIN can't trade at $150B, when compared to Paypal and Square multiples

# 

# Argument for Sustained Revenue

* **$COIN** collects fees on buying *and* selling. If the assets were to suddenly correct, $COIN will still collect fees on the sell side. **We can make a strong claim that $COIN's revenues are primarily dependent on volume, not asset prices**

stock,wallstreetbets,Robinhood Stock Lending Experience,"TLDR: How much can you make? About 0.1%. Not 1% -- 0.1% annually. Almost nothing.

I'm sharing my experience with Robinhood Stock Lending because it was very hard to find information online about how much you can make.

Robinhood states, ""... stocks with low market availability and high demand are more likely to be borrowed.""

I owned about 600 shares of a low volume stock that had a short squeeze in the month of February. It went up about 50% and had 50x more than the average volume on many of those days. Thus, I think the month of February encapsulates what would probably be the best month to loan out my stock.

Throughout February, I owned about $10k to $16k, with all shares loaned out for every day of February.

From February, I earned a whopping $1 and 36 cents (just to be clear). That's approx, conservatively a 0.16% annual rate.

So, this is nothing (at least with the amount of stock I own). And the question becomes, is it worth it for my stock to be loaned out to short sellers who are going to manipulate the stock I believe in and also apply downward price pressure? For me, that's not worth it, and I turned off stock lending.

According to Robinhood, they determine how much you make by ""a rebate rate that is 15% of the weighted average rebate rate we earned by lending that stock to borrowers on that day."" Per my understanding, this means they loaned it out with about 2.4% interest, which makes sense.

But, @ Robinhood, that's way too low. It's our money/property after all. Want us to take the risk that you default (which, check notes, [almost happened](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/27/robinhood-report-meme-stock-gamestop/#:~:text=On%20the%20morning%20of%20January,of%20the%20NSCC's%20rules%20and)) and let stock/vote manipulators bet against our own companies? 15% is too low.Robinhood Stock Lending Experience

stock,wallstreetbets,Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble!,"Lately, there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever.

>Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11)Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - [Bank of America](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11)

Even professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.

>This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/)

Adding to all of this, we can see that the Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.

https://preview.redd.it/s3433pgehv281.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34778dd2920cd572b20e58a75ebdb81594ba003

While it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \[1\].

So what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \[2\]

**The Warning Signs**

Let’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)

**PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)**

The price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.

The current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).

The red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.

**Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)**

1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020. While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.

**Increasing use of leverage**

There are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.

[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \[3\]

The below research by Goldman Sachs shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.

**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**

More than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.

SPACs \[4\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/)

This is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypt\* where [NFTs are being sold](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!

**Investor expectations**

More than the P/E ratio, **investor expectations** seem to be the highest in recent history. The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.

If you consider a [four-year time period](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/), stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.

Now that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,

**Are we certain it’s a bubble?**

There are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.

**Low-interest rates**

This is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the historically low 0.25% that we have now. This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.

https://preview.redd.it/gw4vqstnhv281.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c78bf3ac750bd3ba1cb375e9d7be56e1082ce590

**New Investors**

It’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. But the data they put out during their IPO filing shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.

https://preview.redd.it/yyzegcjohv281.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86dc8058868a637e70a9a9a1e0a86e470a03a72

**401(k) and Index funds**

As I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/). According to [this report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.

The key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \[5\].

**What’s the implication?**

As long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected

**Conclusion**

The market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.

But, that’s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.

The expected annual return by investors above inflation is a whopping 17.5% (which is 161% more than what is realistic) — This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.

Even if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, [this thread from Corry Wang](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.

Basically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‘98), **making money using that information was hard!** There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.

It makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a [crash from as far back as 2017](https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/). Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!

As Peter Lynch quoted,

>Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves

trade,wallstreetbets,Should I Sell And Full Time Trade?,"As title states. I am wondering if I should sell my business and full time day trade options. I am looking for advice, because I know this is the group for that.

Background Info:

I am no spring chicken 42 (M) 6"" (not height). I am currently an owner of a small restaurant and I hate it. I have to keep dealing with these barely 20 something waiters and chefs who bitch about almost everything, and business is not as great as it was before. I can't take it anymore. They have no idea what an owner have to deal with.

I saw options trading once on my friend's phone and he made it sound easy. I feel like I already know a lot about the stock market.

Questions:

•Do I have the option to trade all year round?

•I'd really like to buy a Toyota Prius, can I do that in a few months time? Is this profitable enough?

•I am no stranger to working 14-16 hour days, would that be enough to full time day trade?

&#x200B;

My current plan:

If I can make $2000 by the end of next week and another on the next, that's enough proof for me that I can do $2k a week. I will fire all these little shits and will sell the business asap.  


*EDIT: This is my attempt at a shitpost based on the below:*

trading strategy,wallstreetbets,GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,"I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME, and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post, so here it is.

Obviously I'm going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze.

**First, the comment as it was:**

*I've seen lots of bullish TA on GME. Keep in mind, ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should. We haven't had any volume on GME in over a week.

Holding shares simply isn't enough - needs constant (all day every single day) buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options.

If you buy options that are 20-30% in the money they literally can't price pin because they can't get and keep the price 20-30% below current market. So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge, and virtually eliminate their means of counter-attack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain (price at which most contracts expire worthless).

If you are intending to help push the squeeze, buy shares throughout the day every day. If you are playing options, mostly buy calls in the money. If you're buying OTM calls, buy as close to current price as you can afford. The more imbalanced OTM calls are, the more they're just going to price pin at maximum pain. They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge.*

Essentially, we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop. There are two major reasons. 

1. Manipulation. We cannot do anything about this really, aside from buy and hold. Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels. The shorts, while stuck in a stupid position, aren't stupid. They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup, and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup.

2. Volume. All technical setups require volume to play out. If volume doesn't follow, the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable. Except in this case, it goes down because it's being shorted at every chance.

So what do we need to do? Hold? Yes. But that can't be it. If we are doing nothing but holding, this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient. They can literally hold us in a stalemate for months/years if volume never shows up to move the price. *Yes, they pay more interest the longer they have to wait. They'll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation.* 

#Volume

Without volume, there is no endgame. Look at every day we've had spikes. Look at the volume. Now look at the past week or two. We aren't making progress because nobody is buying shares, aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks. Believe it or not, the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze. The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time. If it catches on, they can follow it up. But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy, they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail.

This thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days. If you look at any day, there are surges in buy volume, but they're short. That's likely a whale, testing the market. If they see confirmation/follow-up from the market, it's less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure. So it will be something like, whale buy, retail confirmation buys, whale buy, runaway effect, gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze. All of those things have to happen consecutively, fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack.

Now this is going to sound counterintuitive, but in order to catalyze the squeeze, we have to stop just buying the dip. When volume picks up and the price is spiking, that's the most important time to buy. That's the point when additional buying pressure is most important. And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes, we are going to keep bouncing back and forth.

#Options

The other side of the coin is options purchases. **Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets.** This helps the short positions, because it forces the market makers to help the shorts. Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk. When you buy an $800c, it does two things.

1. They don't have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral.

2. In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price.

You can do some additional reading on max pain price in options, but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless. When you buy OTM call options, you're increasing the maximum pain price, which makes it easier for market makers (and shorts) to pin the price there.

If, however, you're buying a ton of ITM call options, you're doing two things:

1. Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 1.00. This means that in order to remain risk neutral, the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract.

2. It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI. This means in order to pin the price at max pain, they would need to drop it from it's current price.

Not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately (meaning they don't care where the price goes), you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price.

If you must buy OTM calls, buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM. The further OTM you buy calls, the more likely the price will go sideways. You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases. Once it achieves a runaway squeeze, which will be easy to identify, you can start buying your lotto tickets.

Tl;dr: In my opinion, if you want to help catalyze the squeeze, you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 10-20% in the money.

trading strategy,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with this trading strategy?,"I gotta be honest with you, I'm kinda mentally handicapped.   
But I don't understand how my strategy couldn't work. I've been using Bollinger bands  
since they do a great job of keeping the chart within the boundaries almost at all times.  
So isn't it a good idea to just always sell an asset short while it's at the top, say above 2SD,  
then secure gains at around the midline? Wait for it to go to an extreme value again, and take a long or short position accordingly once again?  
I identified two risks, first is the price moving in a slow trend with low volatility, when there might not be any opportunity to sell, or when the price makes a strong fast movement. The first risk can be mitigated by simply selling after some set time, and when the price remains roughly in the middle for a long time, and the second situation can be identified with moving averages. This strategy has a downside of not taking advantage of long and big price movements, but should be absolutely killing it in ambiguous market conditions when the price is moving horizontally, or at least that's what I figured. Most stable stocks should have a lot of those ""boring periods"", when the strategy works. Even if the market was changing periodically, it should still generate positive outcomes. With well planned stop losses, how could this not generate worthwhile returns? ",6,"

>TL;DR: I think Bollinger Bands could be used to generate consistent returns in sideways markets, but I may be wrong.",TA tells you what has happened.   It has zero predictive power.   Trends that you think are ending will continue beyond what you would expect and price action will reverse at the most unexpected times.   Bollinger bands are not the path to unlimited effortless money.,">It is impossible to predict the future movements of markets with 100% accuracy, so there will always be some risk involved in any strategy. However, your strategy sounds like it could work well in many situations and may produce good returns overall. One thing to keep in mind is that Bollinger bands are based on historical data, so they may not be as accurate in predicting future price movements. Also, moving averages can lag behind the current price, so you might miss out on some potential profits if the market starts moving up or down quickly. Overall though, this seems like a solid strategy that could work well in many cases."

2 ways it affects it, first through risk reversal, it calculates the difference between IV of OTM calls and puts (usually 25 delta). If positive, there is a long bias on the underlying pair, if negative, short bias.

Second way it affects them are through pink risk. When you have massive positions expiring in the coming days and the underlying's spot price is close to the option's strike price, the strike price will serve as a magnet for the spot price of some sorts as the option buyer will adjust hedge according to changes in the underlying delta. That is if call on eur/usd goes OTM, (euro depreciates), the delta will approach 0, he will therefore sell his current positions in USD as to readjust his hedge. This is increasingly important when expiry date approaches as delta approaches extremes. ",,

Have you ever thought one day instead of  doing all the technical analysis shit just randomly choose a direction and that's it.

I think they way we trade most of the times is doing a daily/weekly analysis. Like in the weekend you look at a certain currency pair and start putting support/resistance, trend lines, fibonacci, indicators, price action, watch economic calendar, etc. Sometimes actually works and sometimes not and then you wonder ""what did i do wrong?"". We've recently seen markets are moved by manipulation and who the fuck knows what else. When economic news are released we don't know how market is reacting. Before, if the news/reports were negative, market is bearish, if they were positive it was bull. Apparently now that shit doesn't work anymore.

Sooo, imagine just one day at the market opening look at what you wanna trade and buy or sell based on nothing, just your intuition or because you've seen in the chart it's been going up/down. And just close your position at the end of the week or because you're comfortable with your profit/loss.

1. In stocks / equities in the US, market is open for 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week. Forex trades 24/5. 

2. Stocks / equities always always always have a long bias in high time frames (think of a chart that shows 2+ years). This is because stocks are widely used as investments. This can both create and destroy edge. Forex pairs trade in ranges, AUD/USD isn't going to magically double in 2 months like a stock might - forex is more stable / consistent. 

3. You can trade forex at night / in the morning / when you're not working a 9/5. You can't do that with stocks. 

4. Generally, forex trading is more profitable than trading stocks (though generally more risky). With forex, I can easily make 20% on a trade consistently (20% of position size) where as with stocks you'd be lucky to consistently make 1% or 2% on your positions on a consistent basis. Sure this changes with iptions but options have way more risk than forex. 

5. With forex, you don't have to get into company financials or any of that speculative nonsense. There are a limited number of quality currency pairs that everyone trades and they all move off the same economic data / signals in different ways. 

Personally, I started as a swing trader with stocks, I moved to day trading, I did options and futures, and now I have landed on forex.

The latest Fed comments continued to suggest a lack of concern regarding the rise in yields as Fed's Evans viewed the current rise in rates as healthy in which he attributed the increase to real factors and expectations for a rebound, while Evans also stated he is not thinking about YCC as a policy proposal at the moment and has not set his forecasts for the March SEPs but does expect it will be stronger than December.

For example(I'll use stocks as an example to make it simple), Imagine, there are:

-2 Bids for Stock X at $100

and 

-2 Asks for Stock X at $101

None of the buyers or sellers are willing to budge. All of a sudden, 1 of the buyers gives up and puts in a market order to buy at the Ask of $101. Now we remain with only 1 Bid at $100 and 1 ask at $101 and no one budges anymore so no transactions are made anymore.

Would the candlestick chart remain at $100 since that's the Current Available Highest Bid Price or would it have gone up to $101 and stayed there since that was the last traded price where the bid was $101.

Consequently. Would the Bid/Ask quote remain the same as before. I.e $100/$101?

Thank you.",1,"The bid price would stay at $100 because that one buyer was absorbed into the bid price. So there's still one person buying at $100 and one person selling at $101, so the price hasn't changed, what has changed is there is now half the liquidity in the market.

Good question btw. Got me thinking.",[deleted],Is forex comparable to stocks in that way? Aren’t we transacting with a bank not with other holders of the currency? In other words the ask is always what the bank is asking. And the bid is always what the bank is willing to pay.
stock price,Forex,Liquidity and Volatility - Thoughts,"Traders can benefit from the volatility and liquidity of the stock market (Trade The Pool) by engaging in day trading. A single trading session might see a stock's price swing significantly, offering chances for fast gains. Because it has the ability to provide significant profits in a short period of time, this is advantageous for both new and seasoned traders.",4,"Yes, trading in the pool can typically produce higher degrees of volatility than other trading strategies. It results in a profit.",I only trade during the New York session since there is so much volatility and it is so simple to trade the pool.,"Due to the high volatility and ease of trad the pool, only trade during the New York session"
strategy,Forex,Anyone only trades high impact news as a strategy?,If so please give some insight,4,"It’s a grand part of my trading life, so yes, always.

Particularly juicy on aud, nzd overnight rate changes when I wake up to either small losses or fucking massive gains.

Usually there’s 1 or 2 healthy returns a month when somethings unexpected.

I have a bot that opens pending longs above current price and a sell order that shorts below current price.

Any major data release; the bot will attempt to trade it for me.

Requires extensive research so you don’t screw yourself and take losses both ways…",No wayy. I stay away 30min before/30 min after. Seems to risky unless ur trading with large stops. Or no stops at all but if ur doing that then what the hell are u doing,Yes
strategy,Forex,Will sharing a strategy reduce its edge?,I wonder if the reason people are so reluctant to share their profitable strategy is because they don’t have one or because it will lose its edge if too many people find out?,5,"The amount of effort you put in, it's hard to get into depth so I don't bother, I just tell people to use babypips, watch some YouTube then come see me in 2 years. 

11 times out of 10, they gave up after 6 weeks.","The factor that makes a strategy profitable is the trader and their experience with it. Take the pullback strategy for example.

* **Trader A** uses it like a bot (systematically).
* **Trader B** uses it while considering swing structure.
* **Trader C** uses it with swing structure, retests, and S/R levels.

**A** will not survive every market condition. **B** will know when to stop trading, but have considerable drawdown. **C** will have the least drawdown of the three.

Trader C proved that the pullback strategy is profitable. But the other two made it look like a failure. It's the wielder not the sword.

So it doesn't matter if everyone knows about this strategy -- because they don't have the main ingredient of experience in the form of hours.","Dont think so. I just dont want my friends to copy my trades so they could earn more than me. N if they steal it n decides to sell a course one day based on my holy grail 😅

strategy,Forex,"Just lost my 3 Funded, My strategy works at the beginning really good but then I get of Track, What should I do?",I am taking a brake and then back to Demo first,1,"Find the root of your psychological problems.

I know everyone talks about manipulation and market makers or whatever but the biggest issue in my opinion are emotions and controlling them. There’s no time limit on the, there’s no course you can buy. Only thing you can do is keep going and find the root of the problem.
I was eager to full time, to just get a better life for myself and loved ones- for 3 years I gambled myself almost to homelessness and have just gotten out of it by working 2 jobs, saving a years worth of expenses, being frugal etc.. Once, I did that- I stop being greedy using massive lot sizes and from there lowered my lots and let the trade do it’s thing. Slowly passing challenges, slowly compounding my personal account. Boom- I’ve been profitable for the past year. Now, I’ve found my stride. Still working part time to not slip into a bad situation.","idk why people are referencing your strat, if it “works at the beginning really good” then it seems it works fine enough, the problem, as you identified within the title, is YOU. telling you to “learn discipline” may not seem that simple, but honestly that’s the most straightforward way to put it. if you can maintain that, then when you work through your strat, it should be easy enough atp to determine if it was just YOU or your strat.","It is probably not your strategy, but your psychology. Are you as consistent and disciplined as you were before?"
strategy,Forex,How much time/experience did it take you to have a winning strategy?,"I have started studying forex for a month and a half and, even though the 90% statistic scares me, I continue using market simulators for trades and stockpile pdf's to read. But taking all of this into account, will it be enough or is there a threshold I must cross to join the 10%? Does it take time and expertise or a sharp mind? I myself have autism, I find that I'm not too intelligent or clever when it comes to understanding market movements. I have +30 books to read by now, so I won't be hitting that threshold soon, but I want to know if I will be able or not to succeed in this.",54,"It took me 2.5 years of studying/practicing 6-12 hours a day to get to a stage where I wasn't having any losing months. The 90% statistic is scary, but what makes it even scarier is that it doesn't mean that 10% of forex traders are doing it for a living. It means that a big chunk of that 10% has just been lucky enough to have their account balance sitting in the positive during whatever snapshot of time that data was gathered. The real failure rate is closer to 99%+.

No, you don't need to be Rain Man or have a 200 iq, but keep in mind if you are going to continue with this, you will need to be obsessed. Trading will likely consume your entire life. Right now, you seem to be doing the right thing. Information gathering and theory-crafting is step one, and reading all sorts of pdfs is a good way to gain exposure to how various people view the markets. Don't take anything you read or hear as gospel or as a holy grail, but just keep it in mind and if it makes logical sense to you, backtest it heavily.

The next step is taking a combination of what you learned, attempt to break it down into definable variables, and backtest the living hell out of every factor you want to use in your trading framework. This can take months or even years and can be soul-crushing, but it is necessary. If you don't give up during this stage, and you have crafted a trading strategy that works well throughout your historical data and has proven to also work in the live markets, then continue to execute that plan while managing risk and reducing your exposure across correlated markets, and your account will steadily grow. Good luck!","Anything below 6 months is speculation and luck. After 6-8 months you will be able to start making money but not sure if you will be able to pay all your bills from it. After 1 year you can potential start paying bills from this. 

Why is 1 year minimum? Because you need to go at least once through all market conditions. Certain elements will influence the market in May but most like they will not be the same elements that influence it in December. 

You need to spend a lot of time before you truly become profitable. Remember that on the other side of the trade there might be a professional that has gone to University and spend maybe 3-5 years to learn the same thing you are trying to do. In order for you to make a profit someone else needs too loose their profit. So this is just a very big chess game. If you are not good at calculating your next 3 moves you will never pay your bills from the forex (or stock) market. 

You should spend 50% of your time reading everything you can find and the other 50% trading (use in the beginning a paper account). After 1 year spend 25% reading and 75% trading. 

Why read what others are writing? Not because they will give you the winning strategy as most likely you will learn their mistakes instead. But because there are certain lessons to be learn from other people’s mistakes as well. It is like your parents telling you when you were young “don’t go in the deep end at the pool as you might drown”. You never tested if this is true or not. You just understood it is a mistake and never made it. 

One mistake that I did and am recommending you avoid it is “never use an indicator if you don’t know what it does”. Do not use MACD and RSI just because you read about them in all of the books and blogs. Go on investopedia and read what they are. What their formula is and understand why it is not perfect. 

Next step would be (if possible) to learn some scripting such as Python or PineScript and make your own data analysis and your own indicators (by modifying some existing ones and improving them). At least for me this is what has made me truly profitable. 

And remember, in forex, that the best indicator is your calendar. No matter what your strategy is if a PMI or PPI or unemployment number comes out, they have the power to change the market trend in 1 minutes. So find a data provider that shows you when different numbers come out. And always have an eye on them as information (data) is king/queen 🤴👸

Hope this helps somehow.","It took me a year of programming to develop my own indicators and put them together to build a system. It took me a few weeks to solidify my risk management. 

It's taken me 3 years and still counting to get my head out of my ass and focus on being a quality trader. Looking back, I've found that the most difficult thing to grasp was trading psychology. Systems are easy. You build it, test it, modify it, test it again and continue. 
Your own mind though, that is the difficult part. Especially since your conscious stress becomes subconscious self loathing and then in turn, the subconscious self loathing becomes an avenue for you to sabotage yourself without even knowing. Eventually you are pulling your hair out because you cannot understand why you are not producing the same results as what your backtesting did. 

My advice to you is to build a system that allows you to trade infrequently during quiet times in the market. 
A system that trades frequently will get caught by a lot of the noise the market produces when the big traders enter/exit their positions. 
Understand what support and resistance is, not the conventional lines but the actual supply and demand zones. These are areas where big money either sees the asset undervalued enough to buy or overvalued enough to sell. 
Once you have that in place, you can then add indicators (or whatever) on your charts to help give you a clear picture of the reactions to these zones of interest. 

Please, do not listen to these knuckle daggers when they say that price action is better than indicators or that scalping is better than swing trading. The fact of the matter is that your brain will process information the way only your brain can and it is your job to find a technique that aligns itself with the processing capabilities of your brain. There is no such thing as the best strategy or the best system or the best technique. These trading styles only seem best to the individual simply because that style fits in with how their brain processes information. Some people need pretty pictures and shapes while others rely on raw data and statistical probabilities while others don't need anything and can gather information from pure price action alone. The market has a niche for every thought process, find one that resonates with you and practice that. 

Or you can just yolo your money into options and pray to the nine tailed god of the moon that you will get lucky."

strategy,Forex,Question for those using a 1m strategy on prop firm evaluation,"Hi everyone,

Long time viewer, first time poster.

I'm 2 years in now and I'm happy I have an edge with my mechanical strategy based on the 1 minute time frame (backtested). 

I've recently started an evaluation for a 10k account with Blue guardian, my question is a simple one really;

Has anyone else done an evaluation with a strategy based on the 1m timeframe? It's the commission that is hammering me, if I'm risking 1% (so $100) - and the stop loss works out at say 5 pips (using say 4 lot) on EUR/USD I can commonly be paying up to $25 in commission. How do people get around this? Or at least what is the most optimised way around this. I'm working on 2:1RR

Ps I'm happy with my 1m strategy that only sees me trading the new York open. It works well with  work/personal life. So not looking for another strategy on higher tf.

Tia for any help 🙏",7,"It appears this thread is about Prop Firms and Scouting Programs. [**A detailed overview and comparison of popular forex prop firms can be found here.**](https://volatility.red/Trader_Scouting_and_Prop_Firms_Overview_and_Comparison)      


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Forex) if you have any questions or concerns.*",You get around it by having a higher risk to reward. Unfortunately I don’t see you being able to pass a challenge with a 2:1 RR. You’re risking double that of what you’re trying to profit. That’s really gonna be hard to be consistent with. You’re risking $100 to only gain $50 and commission is $25 so you’re risking $100 to only gain $25. You’ll just never get ahead. You’re RR needs to look like 1:3 1:4 that’s how you’ll get past the commission,I have the same problem. Have a very good strat at 1:2 on 1min and also with blue guardian. However I end up with losses worth almost as much as the profit because of fees and spread/slippages. Will have to switch for higher tf or higher risk reward or just another strategy..
trading,Forex,The realities of Forex Trading. You won't get 'rich'.,"Forex trading is a job. Its not a path to wealth or riches. You gotta wake up every day and sit there watching the markets... And if you don't watch it right you don't get paid.


If you watch it perfectly.. you might make 2-4% per month realistically.

As comparison... If you study hard and get a nice programming job in tech... That might pay 6kUSD per month work from home after 2-3 years.. you get paid 6k as long as the code works... And almost anyone can learn this if they try.
You will always get paid the 7k. You can take sick days. You can take holidays. You can finish the job on 2 days and spend the next 3 days playing video games.. and still get paid.


If you Forex trade and want to make 7k consistently per month you need 175k in Cash. You then need to take your 175k and deposit it in some shady broker website where you could randomly never see the money again..

Then you need to deal with your broker taking commissions of every trade... and possibly stop hunting you for your 175k.

If you've never had 175k to your name. Really ask yourself. If you had this money would you really put it at risk day trading Forex?


After all of this.. If you've worked hard and not taken any days off.. you can make 7kUSD per month.


Then you gotta pay your taxes yourself, and your health insurance, and bills...


This is a game thats designed to be played when you sold a small business for low 7 figures and you can throw a few 100k to a reputable broker, and make a wage on the side while you work on your next business.

Its not something you can take 2k and turn it into earning 20k per month. Not in 3 decades can you do this. And the worse part is every single day you sink into this.. is a day you have to explain to an interviewer why there's a hole in you resume for years while you essentially gambled like a degenerate wearing a monocule.

These skills are not readily transferrable.

Edit:

I gaurentee you not ONE of the replies in this thread has ever seen 175k in their bank account in cash. They simply cannot comprehend that kind of money and what it means to put it at risk.

They are trading 2k-10k accounts and trying to extrapolate their profits and emotions to 175k.

It does not work like that.

Yearly Update:
There have been entire generations of Forex traders that have come here, read this post said that's not me, wasted the last year cycling 2k after 2k trying to make 10% a week and blowing it.. and then quit to go to some next get rich quick scam.",10,Just because you suck at trading doesn’t mean everyone else does 😂,"I think the only thing of value that you said was that ""Forex trading is a job. Its not a path to wealth or riches""

You don't need to watch it everyday, it depends on your trading style.

People don't join this group to be told they should become programmers.

Some people can easily make 20% a month. It depends on the skills they've developed as a trader. Its definitely not easy but it is possible.

This is a game that can be played by anyone. You don't need 100k to make money. If you are good enough you can get a funded account for a few hundred dollars. You can also flip accounts. It's riskier but still possible.

""These skills are not readily transferrable."" - You are absolutely wrong about this. There are skills that you learn while studying forex and strengthening your psychological skills. You must not have learnt them yet.

Just because you've blown your accounts doesn't mean other people cant achieve things you consider unrealistic.

Respectively this is a subreddit where people can ask questions and learn. Your reality and everyone else's isn't the same.","I know a couple of people personally that make way more that 7k a month,that started with 1000$ more or less,not 175k.

How to start with forex is like starting at anything else. You’ll want to start with gaining as much knowledge as possible and then start organizing  that knowledge in a meaningful way. Basically creating a “mental model”. That’s what learning grants us are different perspectives, you’ll need multiple perspectives to tackle the FX markets.

To start I’d familiarize yourself with the idea of mental models, second level thinking, and heuristics.

“It’s not easy” memo by Howard Marks

https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2015-09-09-its-not-easy.pdf

Books (psychology)

1.	⁠“Poor Charlie’s Almanac” Charlie Munger
2.	⁠“The most important thing” Howard Marks
3.	⁠“Thinking fast and slow” Daniel Kahneman

The last chapter of poor Charlie’s almanac is where the good stuff is at. 

FX specifically I could give you an exhaustive list but I’ll give you the 3 I wish I had started with. It would’ve saved me a lot of time.

1.	⁠“The art of currency trading” Brent Donnelly
2.	⁠“Foreign Exchange: Practical asset pricing and macroeconomic theory” Adam S. Iqbal
3.	⁠“The alchemy of finance” George Soros

Brent is going to give you everything you really need to start trading FX, a scaffolding to stand on to see over the wall. Fundamentals, seasonality, technicals, risk management, how to obtain up to date market information, continued learning in book recommendations, psychology, the total package.

Adam is going to take you deeper, explain OTC options and pricing, then give you a way to organize information into a useful format.

Soros is going to show you the due diligence required to make a great trade, and teach you what he believes reflexivity is all about. It’s a disorganized mess of a book, the guys not much of a writer, if you can persevere and understand what Soros is trying to tell you it’s invaluable. 

If I could give you a tip stay away from YouTube, and people who want to give you a trading system. If you read those books above, and take notes, you’ll be able to figure out your own systems for trading.

There’s some quantitative modeling books I could recommend, let’s just stick with the more broad basics for now. This is how I wish I had started.  Good luck.

I know the sum of all these books is kinda expensive, you can find most of them as PDF’s if you look around.

“Technical analysis of the financial markets” John J Murphy

“Currency Trading and inter-market analysis” Ashraf Laidi

“The art and Science of trading course workbook” Adam Grimes

trading,Forex,Quit trading,"I've been trading for 2 years, and I haven't seen any improvement at all. It feels like I've wasted 2 years for nothing. Despite using indicators like EMA, Impulse MACD, and some price action, none of them work to make me consistently profitable. I'm tired of my stop loss getting hit every time I enter a trade. It's frustrating! Have any of you felt this way, and if so, what did you do to overcome it?",31,"Of course, it’s a very difficult skill to master.

trading,Forex,Trading is too much,"Hi guys, I am a full time Forex trader using prop firms such as FTMO, I am funded for 150k and am actually making good money but I find it so stressful. I don’t know what to do because it’s taken me 5 years to get to this point and I’m glad to of finally made it but my god the stress is awful. Anyone got any ideas?",52,Going to a job is stressful too,"**Step 1) TAKE A BREAK.** Right now. Minimum 1 full trading week Sunday-Saturday. Take a whole month off if you are really so stressed out that it's debilitating. You cannot trade effectively if you're stressed out any more than you would be going to the gym. You need to take the time to give your nervous system a break and a chance to heal and reset.

**Step 2) Make a plan to limit all of your entries to a small window each day.** Forex is a 24/7 market and you cannot give your nervous system and the rest of your body the ability to relax if you are trading at any time throughout the day all willy-nilly with no consistent rhythm. Personally, I will only enter a trade during the 3-hour window before and after NY Open from 8am-11am EST, or the 90-minute window when Tokyo is opening if I find a good swing trade opportunity. You need to get very regimented and develop a regular, consistent, and cyclical schedule that is intentionally limiting. There's no structure that holds people together in the market so you have to create that structure for yourself.

**Step 3) Lower your position sizes so that you stop feeling stressed out on a trade-by-trade basis**. No arbitrary risk % / trade number matters at all until your size is small enough that you wouldn't be phased even if you lost 25 trades in a row in some worst case scenario, much less one single trade which is where you're at now.

This is a simple 3-step system that will eliminate a huge portion of the unnecessary stress that you have been accumulating day-in and day-out for as long as 5 years. These are the things that I did that took me from being constantly stressed out and insanely emotional to being consistently profitable month-over-month with minimal stress and negativity attached. It's easy as hell to follow because it requires doing LESS work, not more. If you follow the guide, you won't want to revert to old ways because **you'll be making more money with less work, and most importantly, LESS STRESS.**

Good luck my dude, I have faith in you.","Welcome to money management.

trading,Forex,Why do most people fail at trading?,Do they actually just throw their money and gamble or do they learn a bit but fail?,56,If it's just on this sub? Then spread with tight SL 😂,"I think there’s 3 main things:

**(1) Trading has a very low barrier for entry. Meaning, almost anyone can start trading right away knowing practically nothing.**

Very few professional fields/careers that can pay a lot have this low of a barrier. You can’t just do brain surgery from day one in medical school. You can’t play for a professional sports team on TV when you’ve never played the sport before. 

So, people accept that it takes years and incredible amounts of effort to make it in those traditional fields. However, because the barrier to trading is low, many assume that somehow doesn’t apply to trading, when it very much does.

**(2) Trading requires you to completely change the way your psychology works, at a very deep level, and most people either can’t handle it or don’t want to.**

Many things in trading run counter to both our societal conditioning as well as our natural instincts. These things are incredibly challenging to change, and it’s an intense and long process to reconfigure them such as to become profitable. Many just don’t have it for doing that or don’t deem it worthwhile.

**(3) Many people start on this path assuming they can “get rich quick and easy”, so when they find out it’s not quick nor is it easy, they simply quit and move on to the next shiny thing.**

You really have to have a passion for trading to make it to the point where you’re actually able to make yourself wealthy. Many do not have a passion for trading, and just want a shortcut. Once they see it’s not, they quickly move on to another get rich quick scheme.","Psychology is key. Learning to read the charts takes years of practice.

trading,Forex,Price Action Trading,Is there anyone here who uses just price action to trade. I am talking about a naked chart with no indicators added? All you use is the price action allied with candlesticks.

It works good for me. There are many other traders out there that do the same.

underlying stock price,Forex,Thinking of adding Forex tool to my belt.,"Benn exposed to the markets for >10 years.  Trading on my own since COVID (like many stock and options traders of late).  I am thinking of trying my hand at Forex as well.  I peek periodically at them and truth be told it doesn't seem to be that wildly different.  I trade a mechanical, indicator-based system that requires a few checks and balances before I pull the trigger.  I have a rigid risk limit of ~1% of my account that I don't break and is often times much less than that around 0.5-0.75%.  

I have a couple of questions before I start paper trading it.  

1) I understand you can get leveraged out the wazoo, but I don't have to right?  Like if I want to risk $200, I realize I am actually risking $20 of my own money because of leverage, but if I have a $20k account and lose 100x in a row that doesn't mean I have actually lost $200k because of some weird thing I misunderstood, correct?

2) With the 18 major currency pairs, this should give a trade signal every few days I would imagine if I am using a longer term chart as my signal.  My question here, is it worth trading the inverse?  If I get a short signal on USD/CAD does that mean I should also risk 1% of my account by going long CAD/USD?  I feel like this is a stupid question and maybe I am not understanding it properly but this is the exact same trade right?  Why would I bother shorting one and longing the other besides effectively doubling down on my position so I am doubly correct or doubly wrong?  What am I missing?

3) What is the spread like typically?  In stocks and options I try to trade things that have about a low spread, high liquid underlying if I am trading a swing.  Is this possible in Forex when trading during the peak overlap hours or do I need to get used to a whole other world of hurt where I can expect substantial slippage on both ends of the trade?

Thank you.  Sorry if these have all been posted before...typical usual Reddit search stinks and gives little to no hits.",2,[deleted],"1) I don’t understand what you’re talking about. I suggest you go over the basics of leverage on Babypips, because I either misunderstand what you wrote or you’re missing something.

2) Yes, you’d be opening the same trade again and I don’t see the point. Also, it’s 28 major pairs, not sure if it was a typo.

3) If you’re trading higher timeframes, largely irrelevant except at session rollover (5PM EST). With most brokers you’ll rarely find spreads higher than 2-3 pips, often going under 1 pip in liquid times. Also, keep in mind that spread only makes sense relative to volatility - assets with higher spreads usually move more pips as well, meaning that at the end of the day the impact spread has on your trade will always be a small percentage. Slippage and gaps are extremely rare in forex.","I would recommend going through the babypips.com course. It's free and while you obvious have trading experience that will give you the advantage over the other new traders you still lack a basic understanding of forex.

Think of it like being successful writing books in Japanese for example, but before writing a book in English you need to brush up on your ABCs"

underlying stock price,Forex,"The ""Flash"" Crash is evidence you should be looking at LOWER timeframes","One thing that ticked me off is blind people advising blind people to not look at the lower timeframes because of this ""flash"" crash.  They blame noise when they are simply not profitable, markets are fractal based and logical down to the tick, and now that they are unprofitable they are now advising others on how to trade just like them- unprofitably.
The technical view of every single ""flash"" crash has been the same old story; the HIGHER timeframe action upon the lower.  For something to crash or pop the underlying conditions must be set so that it allows it.  News or some event can trigger the crash, but it is not causal, it is the straw that broke the camels back so to speak.  If you look on the charts of any pair affected, audusd jpy pairs etc look at the weekly/monthly/2monthly/3monthly timeframes and you will see the weaknesses already present.  GBP crash about 1 year ago? the same.  2008 crash? the same.

If the crash is unusual, it is because you do not pay attention to low timeframes.  Huge crashes where there are large shifts of price compared to prior volatility is an everyday occurrence on the lower timeframe.  All you need is for the higher timeframes to act upon the lower, everyday you find when the 4 hour expresses itself upon the 1 minute.  Now once you are comfortable with these so called ""flash"" crashes you can learn what happens after a large drop and how to trade them, avoiding momentum based trades that will lose you money (no, audusd is not going to drop in the next 2 hours- you know who you are that posted that and you're a coward for deleting your reddit post since you were wrong).

underlying stock price,Forex,Prevalence of Technical Analysis,"Hello, 
I am just breaking into the FX market and drawing together potential strategies to use. I’ve noticed that a lot of posts here regard solely the price-action when discussing trades. My question is: is technical analysis and simple price-action monitoring enough to devise a profitable strategy? 

I’ve been doing past trend analysis based solely on technicals (and while deliberately avoiding news) and it seems like certain trends are definitely predictable without needing an underlying understanding of the fundamentals. 

This would make sense imo since currencies are much stronger than stocks/options and are backed by literal countries/regions so I can’t imagine too much movement would result from fundamentals (unless it was particularly catalyzing news) so most traders would defer to technical data and trading instead. Am I correct in this reasoning?",2,"Yep price action is enough to make a profitable strat. 

From a previous comment it looks like OP came from options trading so I would strongly advise you to focus more on your risk management criteria as this will be the biggest factor in the two markets if you will.

The money that gets pulled out of equities needs to go somewhere and probably because the person that pulled it out found a better place for their money or are worried to lose it and stick it in another currency.  If you look at what happend to the currencies during major crashes like that of 2008 you will see all stock markets pretty much went down but you can see which currencies strengthen because of that dip and which currencies fell. 

Just look how strong the JPY got after 2008, it crushed pretty much everything. Even though the nikkei also tanked. Gold went to the moon and people were desperately looking for havens to hedge against crazy inflation. 

Remember currency is the life blood of everyone and every business and equities are a strong force in our economy, what ever stocks do the currency will react because the money starts to zip around.

It's a LOT deeper than that, and macro-economics is not an easy beast to understand. So these are huge over simplifications. 

",I've made a killing buying gold yesterday and today let the market go down! ,"In some of the smaller non-traditional pairs, a key indicator is the gap in preformance between the two stock markets.

I spoke with a professional trader who was presenting in one of  my classes and he made some good money using this strat.

stock market crash,Forex,If the American & Canadian Stock Markets Crash.... Forex?,"Hello, I'm a newbie investor. I've been hearing a lot about how the stock markets are being supported by printed money in both USA and Canada, while they try to keep everyone afloat during these strange times. There are growing whispers that many other newbie investors are entering the markets and are being fed false hope about easy gains as the market recovers, when the real crash is potentially yet to come. Also, the printed money is going to lead to inflation, but there's a lag time before we feel the effects. So I've been wondering, with both a stock market crash, and the effects of inflation just around the corner, is using FOREX a viable strategy to protect my money?

For example, if I converted all my CAD to the South Korean Wan, before the inflation hits, and assuming business proceeds more or less as usual in South Korea, would that be a way to protect my money? I'm a noob so I'm hoping someone can point out any fatal flaws in this idea....

BTW, the only thing I know about south Korea is that their unemployment numbers are LOW, their covid cases are LOW, and their lock down restrictions, relative to Canada/USA are LOW, meaning their economy probably won't be hit as hard as others.

Is converting to a ""stable"" foreign currency a good way to protect my unstable currency?",1,"easy way to think about it:

there are 4 ""asset classes"".  equities, debt, commodities, currency.

you always either converting 1 to the other.  when you buy stocks- you're  'selling' your currency and you're long stocks/currency

if there was a stock crash your currency would likely appreciate since people are selling stocks/currency

the caveat is if some other nation's stocks are crashing more and soaking up their supply of currency faster then your currency will go down against theirs.

ie: i can tell you what currency is doing by looking at equity indexes but i can't tell you what equity indexes are doing by looking at currency pairs.","I think you’re confusing on how trading is done on the stock market vs the forex market.

Unlike the stock market you can only make money as the stock goes up in value. In Forex you can make money both ways in forex trading, buying and selling. 

Your base currency will always be protected essentially because the only thing that matters in forex trading is when you’re actually in a trade. 

Protecting your equity and margin is the ultimate goal.

To give you an example.

Let’s say I trade in Canadian dollars, and the Canadian dollar drops 2% value against the USD. If I decided to trade a sell (~~USD/CAD~~ meant to put CAD/USD) I can still make money as the value goes down and as the value drops I will be paid in USD. 

Also trading on a weaker currency technically means you gain more profit.","Real estate, physical Gold, Gold ETFs, Bitcoin, etc. are ways to hedge against a double wammy of economic downturn with an inflating currecy. With a Forex broker like Oanda you can convert your local currency into any currency they support. I used to run my balance in AUD. So it would be entirely possible to just bank in a foreign currency if you want. The risk of course, is if the other currency loses against your local currency when you want to access your  money. A Fukushima type of event could wreck your plan. And you will pay conversion fees."
stock market crash,Forex,USD and the stock market.,"So Ive just got a quick question.

Ive got a feel theres a generel idea, that despite the highs on the stock markets, the economy and inflation is slowing. 

I know the USD is a ""haven"", but why in times of a slow economy is it considered more safe than the euro?

stock market crash,Forex,"Market Prediction Algorithms for the US Dollar, the Stock Market and Bitcoin","This book provides an intricate example of how to apply pattern recognition to the daily prediction of tradeable financial assets like Euro/USD and Bitcoin/USD. I demonstrate how the only way to be able to predict the price movement on a daily basis is by strictly using variations in positions of the 1. Moon, 2. Sun, 3. Mercury. & 4. Lunar nodes....and setting those variations within different parameters that call for predictions of either a price rise or fall.Using parameters that call for predictions of either up or down based on variations of the position of the sun, moon, mercury, and lunar nodes, one can find significant patterns that could lead to predicting accurately a tradeable financial asset on a daily basis for a long period of time....possibly leading to a holy grail algorithm or holy grail theory of daily trading via quantitative analysis.

The book also demonstrates how the Dow Jones Industrial Average follows a pattern based on the position of the Sun and Lunar nodes. The basic gist of the algorithm decrees that from the point when the degree of the sun is 3 degrees past(or higher than) the degree of the lunar node(in any sign) all the way until the degree of the sun enters a new sign at the 24th degree mark(using western astrology), a prediction of a market upswing should be applied. From the point when the degree of the sun enters a new sign at the 24th degree mark all the way until the degree of the sun goes 3 degrees past the degree of the lunar node(in any sign), the prediction of a market downswing should be applied.

The final volume contains the percentage ups and downs of the BTC(Bitcoin)/USD currency pair during times when the Sun and Mercury are in the same sign and also during times when the Sun and Mercury are in different signs. These statistics go back to 2012. My initial observation would conclude that there is a higher prevalence of a rise in BTC/USD when the Sun and Mercury are in different signs and a higher prevalence of a drop when the Sun and Mercury are in the same sign. Mercury retrograde periods, however, seem to reverse that pattern, making it to where the Sun and Mercury in different signs would drive the BTC/USD lower, while the Sun and Mercury in the same sign (during the retrograde) would bring it higher.

According to my knowledge, the efficient market hypothesis suggests that over time, (with a perfectly competitive market) your net gain will be zero minus transaction fees so you'll lose in the long term. From what I've heard, forex is one of the most competitive markets. How can I expect to gain a statistical edge in such a high competition market?",2,"No one can until they get a decent edge, fix thier psychology and practice excellent risk management. 

A chart is made of candles, candles are made of price fluctuations, and price fluctuations are made by people who make decisions to eirher buy or sell. 

Even EAs and Algos are made by people to act a certain way, according to the programmers bias. So as long as there are people trading, similar patterns will emerge and taking advantage of those is how you make money.

Like EURUSD the last few days. Much bank was made.",EMH is a bullshit theory. Ignore it completely. You find the edge using technical analysis or fundamental analysis or a combination of both.,"need an edge that is in the green zone.  What is the green zone? RR in relations to your win %.

For example 50% winrate at 1:2 RR will make you tons of money, despite what everyone thinks.

You need to develop an edge that you can trade day in and day out. 

An edge is comprised of a few things.

1) Technical Analysis that results in net positive results.  An edge that is mechanical, rule based approach (100% objective) that leaves no room for subjective trading.

2) Risk management (basic math skills).

3) Probabilistic Mindset.  

4) The hardest of them all:  Discipline and your ability to continue to execute your edge despite the losses that you'll face.  Understanding losses are normal business expense in this business."

market,Forex,how the market reacts after news? i have seen many times the move gets corrcted..,,1,"Well, you're already one step ahead of most people here. You noticed something happens, does this happen most the time? (hint: it does). So what can you do with this information? You build a profitable system around it.

Look at the data, what happens most the time? Does it retrace 50%? 100%? Ok, now you got an average retracement level. So what happens if you enter a trade 5 minutes after news? Could you reliably make a few pips without risking too much?

The answer is yes, but you got to crunch the data. Hard. Trading has far too much money involved for this to be easy, and the people with the GOOD R&D information aren't giving it out. It's human nature, no one else cares if you're rich or not. Anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something.","The market's reaction to news and the reaction afterwards could be the subject of someone's life's work, and is the subject of the way some people make their living.

That said, post-event price trajectories for an individual news event can be quite easy to explain, it's just that to make more comprehensive statements about all the different variations would take a lot longer.

The fastest way to get a feel for this thing is just to watch the news events in real time. However, don't just passively watch them.

1. Find out what the expected values are for the news event

2. Make careful note of the different components of the news event (e.g. headline figure with sub data, headline announcement with written press release, etc)

3. Make notes about where you think the limiting structures (""S&R"") are within the market.

4. See if you can determine how aggressive a bull move vs a bear move might be. Once you realise that news events are not necessarily symmetrical, you'll be ahead of the vast majority of people here.

5. Look to see if you can find certain phases price goes through

6. Turn on tick volume, read up on Wyckoff and stopping volume if you're not familiar with this concept

7. Try to pick the bottom/top. You don't necessarily want to try and jump on there, but it's the best way to begin to read price in the ticker tape/DOM style.

8. Turn on bid/ask so you can watch the spread expand and compress.","News are basically ""fuel"" to the market.

Is it a good idea if I stick to those hours as a part of risk management and practice?   
My winning (and losing) trades are way smaller of course, but much more consistent. In busy hours I'm often too slow or get stopped out by huge swings.",2,Solution : swing trade,"You’re right. Most of the volume in the forex market is traded between 9-10 am est. about 17% of the days volume. So yeah, it’s a bit slower in off market hours but the markets are always doing the same thing.

price,Forex,Paid my price for not setting stoploss.,"Its been around 6 months since i started trading forex. I was lucky to find my strategy that worked out for me. I was able to see good profits but it was never consistent.

Made good profits but then losses were also equal at the end of every month. Although I identify risk management is the root cause, I still didn't set the stoploss for every trade that i took.

I trade using a break from the support and resistance area of interest. If anybody knows how to set stoploss for this method pls let me know.

 I do swing trading and i had no problem watching the charts all the time.Though i knew this will turn against me one day, I just kept going.

Reasons I didn't set the stoploss were that

1. I was always unsure of where i should set my stoploss. I thought maybe if i set it here it would only cause unwanted loss to my trade.
2. This one is new. I was emotionally attached to my trade. I know this sounds strange. But it was the hope that maybe if i hold longer market will go in my favour, which it did happen in few cases but it didn't happen in many and resulted in huge loses.

So today it finally went against me. I took around 4 trades. Every thing was going as expected. But today EURJPY suddenly went down and resulted in huge losses and led to all of my trades being squared off. And yes you guessed right. My account blew up and now im in a loss of 2000$, which is such a huge amount to me.

I'm bit devastated because I figured out everything except the one main thing stoploss.

Gonna take a break and figure out everything and come back to trading once again. I'm not at a good position financially and don't want to give up.

Everything else mentioned in the other comments are only secondary what drives people to bid or ask the prices up and down.

Your initial post about supply running out at a certain price therefore you have to bid lower or ask higher can be applied to any market.

It’s easy to imagine. Think of some market moving event. What if the market existed but there were no people around (humor me for a second). No one would bid or ask the prices up or down. The market wouldn’t move at all. People move the market. Clicking buttons. That is all.

You can even do this (or test this) in a thin market. Go find a super thin market. Buy or sell a bunch. You just moved the market.

share price,Forex,What is your strategy?,"Would you like to share your trading strategy here? And I’d like to know why are there so many strategies out there?

Like… how can you trade USDTRY using the strategy for EURUSD, for example?",2,"If you just want to trade based on highs and lows but price doesn't move as you expect 80% of the time, does that seem like a good idea? Do you think that drawing a line or marking an area where you expect price to reach is just busy work with no purpose or utility, then don't do it. If you know of a different way to improve your probability of making a successful trade, then use that instead. As for why there are ""so many strategies out there"", if you show 100 people a piece of art, how many interpretations of the piece do you expect to hear? Same goes for a chart. Interpretation is subject to perception and I very much doubt two people are ever going to perceive something the exact same way 100% of the time. Genetic twins don't even behave in the same way, so why wouldn't there be a lot of strategies to help interpret a chart that could be interpreted millions of different ways.","If you can guess this, then you know

Buy high , sell low","The reason why one strategy can be effective with multiple instruments across the market is because price movements ultimately are based on psychological levels, which are areas on a price chart that other traders in the market would typically react to when price gets there. There are areas on the price chart of any given asset in the market that are virtually guaranteed to cause some type reaction from most participants in said market, when price gets there, the only job you have is to determine whether you think it's going to go up or down from that point.  At the end of the day, no matter which instrument you're speculating on, what moves the price of that asset is liquidity, and developing the skill of looking at a price chart and being able to identify where the liquidity lies by locating these psychological levels, waiting for price to get there, and then entering a position that doesn't conflict with your directional bias is a strategy that will make you money in any market you choose to participate in."

share price,Forex,"What do you mean when you say ""trade with the trend"" ?","This statement is completely ridiculous because there are many many trends happening at a time. The weekly trend could be up, but the daily could be down with the monthly up and yearly down. None of that makes any sense. By definition, if you buy for a price above the AVG, there's a higher likelihood that it will mean revert and you will lose the trade. An arbitrary trend line cannot predict anything but the previous trend, and by the time a trend is obvious it is bound to reverse.

Here's a secret: The more people that see a trend, the higher the probability that it will reverse, information that's common knowledge has no value in trading. It's as if you were watching where someone was walking, lets say they walked north for 1 mile, just because they've walked north for a mile doesn't mean they're going to keep going that direction. In contrast, it probably means they're about to change direction rather than continue.

Would you look at the monthly chart if you were trading on the 5 minute? No, I don't think you would. The market has sentiment (as you can see in your chart) and that sentiment can be short term or long term. Even if the market does mean revert, is that mean stationary or does it fluctuate as price does? The market experiences different cycles - bullish, bearish, and ranging. So, in an uptrend, maybe you should be buying when the market retraces - there's your mean reversion. You can surprisingly do the same thing in a ranging market. Your job is to determine what cycle we're in.","I disagree with this premise. It's why we use multiple time frame analysis, to evaluate not just the overall trend, but micro trends.

In B.options you're always risking more than you stand to gain & are limited by time. So if price is above/below your entry price in a given time you lose. You also need at least a minimum 60% of winning trades to profit. With Forex you can profit with only 20% of winning trades essentially cause your profits can run forever.

EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVWsaEM4L8g",14,"1) Look at the ISE listed/traded options. They trade like equity options during the equity options trading period. 

2) Also look at options on ETFs that track currencies..the FXE is optionable for instance. Other companies do this but you can peek at the group behind FXE to see their other offerings: [link](http://currencyshares.com/products/overview.rails?symbol=FXE)

3) When googling around, you will run into binary options brokers from all over the world. **Stay the hell away from binary options!** They are a betting tool, not a trading tool, and are structurally designed to put the odds in the house's favor. Even if the broker is state side and is well regulated.. it's still a betting product in the end. To date, the only legit traders I know who've made money from Binaries were people exploiting a broker's erroneous pricing and could arb out the difference.

4) While some brokers offer OTC vanilla options that you trade against them as the counterparty, they are often very limited in selection and have wide spreads... you'll have a hard time paying the fair price (that means implied fair value, or being filled at a price between the bid and ask) going the OTC route at a retail FX broker because they'll likely only execute when you cross the spread or the market moves through your order. Sadly, until there's more competition on the retail level for OTC vanilla options, this is not gonna change. (Examples here are IG and Saxo.. neither I would recommend.) So stick with points 1 and 2 for exchange traded options.

5) There is also options on currency futures. The exposure on these is a lot, a LOT, higher than a single contract on ISE for their equity option style contracts. I'd visit these down the road if you're still into and doing well after building an account up.","Just learn to quit while you're ahead :) I've traded options for bit, it's just too difficult to forecast implied volatility",[deleted]

A friend of mine recently recommended I trade forex via options, saying it's much easier to be profitable and limits the emotional wreckage that still happens from time to time (Looking at you, Abe/Kuroda). Does anyone have experience successfully trading both methods, and can weigh in on this subject?

Thank you for any input.",8,I only trade straight forex and futures. Seems to me it is a challenge enough to pick the right direction.

Here is a reasonable article showing different risk/payoff's => http://www.investopedia.com/university/options-pricing/profit-loss-diagrams.asp
And here is another one on options pricing => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_of_options - be prepared for some fairly complex maths and logic.

Spot trading is fairly simple. You buy something, then attempt to sell it a profit (or the reverse if you've gone short). 

Options are a little more sophisticated and can be used for 

* Speculation
* Insurance
* Income

As far as I am aware, FX options are an OTC instrument and are thus broker specific.
",Trading volatility especially in spot vols is a lot different than trading the underlying. If you know the Greeks and how options and volatility is priced then you will be fine but if you don't learn it first. You also have to know which options structure gives you the best expression(ex: if skew is out of whack or you are worried about basis risk then you buy the risk reversals and then the complete opposite for the butterflies). There are times tho it makes more sense to express in spot over vols so you don't have to change what you've been doing. Your just adding a new tool to the box. If your long gamma your losers will be relatively safer than your underlying positions and if your short it in the wrong environment then your position is far more dangerous then being in the underlying.

However, in forex, your limit order can and is triggered by first reaching your order’s level (price) and then your limit order acts as a market order. If the market pulls back (to where it came from) off the your level fast enough, you limit order makes you lose way more than just the spread and slippage as your buying or selling at a worst price of where you had set your limit order. Why is this?",2,Cause forex brokers are bullshit lol,"probably because your broker is not placing your limit order in the market (i.e. on hotspot/reuters/ebs), but they are just triggering the order when the price reaches your limit price. yes, it is fake if it is not being posted on a real exchange.","Because your limit order is insignificant and slippage happens, even with limit orders when there's no other orders to match to yours.

It's the only business in the world where you can make 100%, pure profit, and NOT have to factor in any other expense outside of taxes. 

Scaling potential, limitless. Opportunities, boundless. 1% on 100k is $1,000, or $10,000 on a $1,000,000 funded account. 

You never have to ""do"" more marketing, 'gain' more customers, hire more employees, or any potential issues that comes with scaling any other business. 

What works for a 100k, works the same for 1MIL. 

I love that I'm completely responsible for my success and failures. No inside job to derail me. No office politics. No ""climbing the corporate ladder"" for executive positions. 

And, no competition. No competing for market share. Me making $1k today won't affect you earning the same, or greater. There's enough room for EVERYONE to play. 

Working out a repeatable system that pulls money out the market is the challenge. 

Because it's so easy and accessible for everyone to get into, that's what makes it so hard.

Once you get past the ""glitz n' glamour"" of the industry, you have to do actual work and do 100's of hrs backtesting to find your edge.

trading strategy,Forex,Popular trading strategy category," When I started educating myself, I was in a group where owner shared courses. I watched so many courses and 99% of the courses you guys consider good are repeated contents. It's obvious those who teach don't have good ideas but copy from forums or each other. That's a high probability setup for those course makers to make money from you. Strategies always can be classified into these categories. I am not saying courses are useless but you could develop your strategy based on the category and keep it to yourself only. Because there's no holy grail and the strategy you make by your own shares the similar win rate within the category.

1. Confluence trading: (Obviously, this category could contain everything as a setup=a+b+c+d+...+z)  

   1. ex: you got liquidity grap at intraday high, then price returned to FVG, pd array, also fib 89.2 blah blah blah and don't forget we're out of 3 standard deviation of the range, now it's going to fade.
   2. ex: this level is confluence with TL, fib, ma, supply/demand, now here is a double tops/bottoms, head and shoulders...blah blah blah
2. Indicator trading:  

   1. ex: Price returned to ma, then my indicator showed me a divergence, also rsi is below 50... blah blah blah
   2. ex: Now market makers is trying to move the market, we have TDI divergence + double tops + pivot levels + correlation divergence + blah blah blah, let's hunt market makers.
3. Order flow:  

   1. ex: now price is at VAL and footprint shows aggressive sellers get trapped and DOM shows an absorption, let's get this.
   2. Big traders were at a level but they cancel their limit orders now, it is a spoofing. Let's get them.
4. Playbook:  

   1. ex: The market gives me one of my setups and I only trade setups in my playbook. If there's no setup in my playbook, then I do nothing.
5. Fundamental:  

   1. ex: lower time frames are for losers. We trade with fundamental trend, so we're with big institutional traders. Let's check the PMI report, economic data, weekly COT release and confirm them and trade setups on the HTF charts. Don't forget reading tweets and listening to your squawk. Information edge is everything.
6. Conspiracy:  

   1. ex: If I get in here, stop hunters gonna catch me. So, I wait for confirmations after the hunting. Damn, I get hunted again, my broker sabotages me. Let's only set hard stop loss where is 100 pips away to prevent extreme events. We only get out when our setup is invalid; otherwise, tell the broker freaking no!
7. Psychology:  

   1. ex: Everything works man. Let's do a meditation session and relax. Keep calm. Lose a trade? You are playing a long-term game. You get 10 losses in a streak? That's normal dude, keep your emotion calm. Let's do a yoga session. You will win one day... one day. It's all about psychology bro.

You can experiment with your tf and emas, but 4h works best for me... not too slow not too fast.","From my experience (trying live some algos I have worked on), first thing is to notice a pattern that repeats frequently and does not depend so much on market changes (for example, in my case, it is breakouts of recent pivot highs and lows). Write some very specific rules (for example, consider a pivot high or low when it is the highest/lowest in a set of 20 bars, then consider a break when price reaches that exact level or a pip above/below, etc.) and then backtest it. That’s how I have been doing it and so far, even though I am still testing it live, but it is working.

Basically you first need some type of behaviour or pattern that you notice repeats often and then set rules and backtest, that is the only way to define a consistent strategy, never break your rules and if you took the time to backtest it and forward test it, then you know the stats and what you can expect.

I posted this on my profile but figured I'd share my story here as it might be interesting for new traders.

A trading strategy is ever evolving and never finished, especially if you can surround yourself with other like minded traders and you collectively try to get better. I went from basic MA crosses on the 15 and 30min to high probability setups on the weekly and monthly.

**My Nr.1 Indicator**

The Bollinger Bands got me excited right off the bat when I started backtesting them. My strategy is to look for candles that greatly overextend outside of the upper or lower band and then counter the move as they will often shoot back in like an elastic band as candles like to stay within the bands.

I look for these setups on the weekly and monthly chart as the shorter TF's give a lot of poor signals. An overextension on the 1 hour will only need a bit of consolidation and maybe a minor pullback before it can easily continue its trend.

It's always hard to say how far an overextension will go (look at the NG rogue wave!) and how long it will take before it pulls back in. To tackle this challenge I scale in with one small position at a time and trading the CFD makes this very easy as you can trade a really small size when needed. I jump in too early almost every single time as I don't want to miss the move but that's fine as the positions are small with wide stops.

**Pullback or Reversal**

You can't just blindly trade every setup of course but by following these moves on the higher TF's there's ample time to research fundamentals and such to determine where price might go and if we're trading a pullback or reversal. I treat every trade initially as just a temporary pullback, then later on if it's starting to look like a possible reversal I might set some positions at BE to let those ride.

**Other tools I use**

Another trusted indicator is the MACD-RSI crossover. These are highly lagging but plotting them on the daily and weekly gives me a pretty good sense of whether the directional pressure is up or down. I also use MA's, historical S&R price levels and round numbers that help with the entries and exits.

Like all indicators these aren't generating guaranteed setups. It's just another piece of the puzzle but if enough pieces fit together the setups can get a very high probability.

**Examples of the Signals or Setups I look for**

Here is an [NZD-CAD weekly chart](https://imgur.com/a/6JG66AW) where I marked the MACD-RSI crossovers. The actual cross precedes the reversal and I don't act on that but once the MACD line (red) exits the histogram (grey bars) the reversal happens or is already underway. Since we're looking at a weekly chart we're also working with large moves that can go on for weeks. What I then do is only trade the direction the indicator gives me and keep scaling in and out with small positions and wide stops until the signal becomes weak or risky. This chart is obviously a great hindsight example and not every cross signals a reversal but whenever this setup occurs the bells start ringing and I do my DD.

Silver just had a great bollinger setup. Overextended on the [weekly](https://imgur.com/uKGjDbm) and floating outside of the bands on the [monthly](https://imgur.com/ymaPRcc). Still felt a little risky due to my lack of experience with Silver but I scaled in 3 times and caught a large part of that retracement.

The challenging bond shorts I started too early and cut yesterday are in hindsight just another monthly bollinger overextension that snapped right back down looking at [Gilt](https://imgur.com/BHuGiQ0) and [Bund](https://imgur.com/JExgS4F).

I mostly trade these bollinger setups on the weekly and monthly so they don't occur that often which is why I follow a lot of instruments.

I also try to trade with more conviction if I see a good setup.*""There is no point in being confident and have a small position"" - Soros*

**CFD and Swap**

My trading fees are the spread and overnight interest (swap). I have more than 30 instruments open at any given time and a number of them have a positive swap if you trade them in a specific direction. I make an effort to only trade the direction that earns me interest as I hate holding onto positions that eat into my profit every day. I will only trade the other direction if the setup is good enough or if the overall interest on all open positions is positive.

**Trading Platform and Hardware**

I use MT4 with a regular FX broker which gives me a wealth of pairs to choose from and a CFD for anything else I'm interested in. I follow 12 FX pairs, Ag, Metals, Bonds, SPX, Oil and NG. I have all of those up on a 6 monitor setup just like you see with those pro traders haha. This is my work and hobby so I might as well make myself as comfortable as possible! [Here's a pic](https://imgur.com/IBUpOK6) for the trading rig nerds ;)

**Things to improve**

Taking profit can be a struggle and is often done too early. I heavily shorted the NG rogue wave from the very top and more recently Corn and Silver. Seeing where they went is sometimes hard to stomach especially since they had a positive swap and there was no need to close the entire baskets. I always tell myself to leave a few with a stop at BE in case the move continues but I often have this overwhelming feeling of being satisfied and drained from the trade after holding for weeks that I just say fuck it and close the whole thing to be done with it and celebrate.

The next one probably applies to more of you, I have to watch for getting caught up in the excitement when things are volatile and overtrade SPX which is my favorite daytrade/scalping instrument. My stats show that 25% of this years profit is from trading SPX so it's been successful but it's hard to stop trading when the volatility is there. I have to learn when to shut it down and take a break.

**Where to go from here**

I'm not a big player so there is ample room to grow and I have been scaling things up lately.

I have 2 full days a week behind the charts to trade which will turn into full time in a couple years if I can maintain the consistency. It's already a decent income considering the time I have to trade but as we all know ""the sky is the limit"" in this exciting industry.",54,"So you are trading the weekly TF?

trading strategy,Forex,I profitably traded FX for a CTA. Here is my complete trading strategy. (Repost 4years ago)," A number of years ago I traded FX for a CTA. I achieved a return of 59.9% and my max monthly drawdown was 13.3% over about a 2 year period. Today, I'm giving away the complete strategy I built and traded to earn this return.

**Basics**

* **Why are you doing this?** I don't trade this strategy anymore due to a pivot in my trading objectives several years ago. I learned the basic concepts from others, so I'm giving back what I've received. It doesn't compete with my current style or the approach of the proprietary trading firm I work for. This strategy has sat dormant on my computer for the better part of a decade so I figured why not dust it off and pass it on. In terms of *why now*, I've noticed an uptick in strategy 101 questions on Reddit and I've started writing answers but stopped because it's just too much for a single comment. My plan is to reference this post in future interactions with traders.
* **How do we know this works?** I could show [my equity curve](https://imgur.com/bsukfTV) and I could give [you all the analytics you want](https://imgur.com/nVRdZyu). But at the end of the day, all that can be faked. My goal is to hand you something which works - provided you are looking for a method and are willing to put in the effort needed to make it work. After reading this post, there literally is nothing stopping you from adopting this, backtesting it, and trading it. So let the method speak for itself.

Let's do this thing.

**Strategy Brief**

In brief, the strategy seeks to participate in an existing trend when momentum picks up in the direction of the trend. Initial stops are tight and are trailed with pullbacks until momentum ends. I traded the strategy on the daily timeframe but it certainly could have been applied to others as well.

* [Real trade 1](https://imgur.com/gTC70wB) \- Bought into fresh with-trend momentum, sold when momentum ended
* [Real trade 2](https://imgur.com/MpDQwrp) \- Bought into fresh with-trend momentum, sold when momentum ended
* [Real trade 3](https://imgur.com/Bc6XSlg) \- Bought into fresh with-trend momentum, sold when momentum ended

There are two key concepts here - **trend** and **momentum**. Let's define them and then get into exact entry and exit techniques.

**Trend**

Put simply, a trend is when price is moving in a certain direction while price swings are in agreement with that general move.

* **Uptrend** \- in an uptrend, price swings are making higher highs and higher lowers. [Concept](https://imgur.com/vV5Mx20), [example](https://imgur.com/AxG6d7f).
* **Downtrend** \- in a downtrend, price swings are making lower lows and lower highs. [Concept](https://imgur.com/uufftph), [example](https://imgur.com/VkNs4oe).

The market doesn't always trend and there are ugly trends out there. This strategy avoids those times in which the trend is not in force to only focus on environments which favor continuation of an existing trend.

**Trend Momentum**

In any trend, there is a cycle of with trend momentum followed by against trend momentum. This forms the pattern of price pushing to fresh extremes in a trend followed by pullbacks against the trend.

When the trend re-exerts itself, you tend to see an explosion of with-trend strength. You can identify these points on a chart by ""big candles"" in the direction of the overall trend.

* [Momentum example 1](https://imgur.com/TyXwHpw) \- A downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of pullback and the continuation of the trend
* [Momentum example 2](https://imgur.com/opmuAnY) \- An uptrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and the continuation of the trend
* [Momentum example 3](https://imgur.com/EA8UQE6) \- A downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and continuation of the trend

And that's really the conceptual backdrop of the strategy: **we find a trend that is in a pullback and look to enter on fresh momentum in the direction of the trend**. You can train your eyes to spot these patterns within a couple of hours of study: it's not rocket science.

**Entry Criteria**

As per the entry, the concepts spell out precisely when to look to enter the market. Find an uptrend, look for a pullback, then buy when you get with-trend strength.

As per my specific entry criteria, I entered with a stop above the market in an uptrend or below the market in a downtrend. For example, if I identified unfolding momentum in an uptrend, I would set an entry order a few pips beyond the high to get me into the trade.

* [Example 1](https://imgur.com/a/otvbmCe) \- Buy stop set above the momentum bar in the direction of the trend
* [Example 2](https://imgur.com/WkIu6q5) \- Sell stop set below the momentum bar in the direction of the trend

**Exit: Initial Stop**

As you can see by [my win ratio](https://imgur.com/nVRdZyu) (32%), this strategy gets stopped out. A lot.

The reason for this is that I am seeking to capture the entire unfolding trend by risking only a small amount to maximize my average win / average loss ratio. The goal here is to make the reward/risk ratio such that when I actually captured a trend, it would compensate me several times over for losing trades. This is very much a trend following strategy designed to deliver outstanding returns when the market trends and scrape along when it doesn't. So the initial stop loss is very tight so as to maximize the reward per unit of risk when the trend cooperates.

For an initial stop loss, I set it roughly halfway into the width of the momentum bar. If the momentum bar is narrow in relation to the recent trading range, then I would set the stop beneath the momentum bar.

* [Example 1](https://imgur.com/wzxR1qU) \- Stop-loss set somewhere near the middle of the candle
* [Example 2](https://imgur.com/QHDW177) \- Stop-loss set somewhere near the middle of the candle

**Exit: Trailing Profit**

The stop loss remains in place until the market forms and completes a pullback in the trend. When a pullback has been completed and the trend continues, the stop loss is moved to the bottom of the pullback in an uptrend or the top of the pullback in a downtrend. This process is repeated until the stop is hit and you are taken out of the trade. In other words, you have very high upside potential on each trade with constrained (but much more probable) risk.

* [Concept](https://imgur.com/a/3uDLyrT) \- Trailing stops are set beneath pullbacks when a pullback completes by pushing into new highs. This process is repeated until you are stopped out.
* [Example trade 1](https://imgur.com/a/kDhejsZ) \- This looks complicated, but it's really not. Every time the market forms a pullback of 2 or more bars, we wait until price closes beyond the pullback in the direction of the trend and then move our stop to the bottom of the pullback.

**Risk Management**

To protect against losses, I risked a firm 1% per trade. If my initial stop was hit, I would trade at such a size that I would lose 1% of my account balance. No exceptions.

The reason here is that with a trend following strategy under this risk/reward framework, you are going to lose a lot. You need to ensure that you can survive 10+ losses straight with minimal dent to your trading book and you only do this through risk management.

**Indicators for Screening**

If you notice on my charts which show actual trades, I had the 10 period moving average and the 200 moving average overlaid on the chart. The reason for this is that I used the 10 period SMA as an scanning indicator and the 200 as a general reference for the trend.

* **10 period SMA** \- I used this indicator to screen for momentum bars. Example: If today's close is the first close above the SMA and we're closing in the top 25% of the candle, then visually inspect the chart to see if we're in a trend and this is fresh momentum in the direction of the trend.
* **200 period SMA** \- This indicator gave me a quick at-a-glance metric to give context to my trend analysis. If I viewed price as in a trend, I wanted it to be above the 200 as a loose confirmation that the general trend was indeed upwards.

My primary focus was on price action: **find a trend, trade fresh with-trend momentum when it appears and then ride the trend until it ends**. The indicators simply served as a helpful scanning tool and you can trade the method without them.

**----Practical Considerations for Real Trading---**

**Practice and Trade Review**

You have to internalize this to actually identify it in real time if you want to adopt this strategy. You do this through backtesting and verification that your live testing is lining up with your backtest.

* **Backtesting** \- I spent hundreds of hours dragging charts one bar at a time and recording trades that I would have taken if it were real-time. On an ongoing basis I would backtest / back-trade the past decade of data for every instrument I traded. This practically meant that I was spending 90% of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and 5-10% of my time actually trading. If you haven't quite figured out trading, I'd suggest you put in serious effort into the area of backtest and intentional practice.
* **Trade Review** \- On an ongoing basis I would do a complete review of all of my trades to figure out how to sharpen my edge and to verify that I was perfectly trading my plan. [Here's a screenshot from just one of these sessions](https://imgur.com/wBKLmXB). No matter your strategy, I believe trade review is crucial. How will you know if you're making mistakes if you're not reviewing what you've done? How will you know if you can do better if you're not carefully questioning each and every trade to try and get better? This sheet has several more columns and was just one iteration of an ongoing review process.

If this seems like a lot of work, that's the point. You are competing against some of the brightest minds in the world. Why would the market allow trading to be as easy as opening an app on your way to the beach? To profitability trade, you really need to invest heavily in 1) verifying that what you're doing has a history of making money and 2) verifying that you're actually executing in perfect alignment with your testing as well as looking for ways to improve performance. You'll always see the lucky dude flaunting his returns, but for the vast majority of professional traders, this is just scratching the surface of the types of analysis you need to do to monitor and improve your discretionary trading edge.

**Psychology**

There's no getting around it, trading is psychologically difficult for many people. My two ""silver bullets"" are **an edge** and **a desire to succeed**.

* **You must have an edge**. First off, do you have an edge? Unless you have a either a demonstrated track record of making money or a backtest of your exact method showing that it makes money, then you'll probably have mental angst. Even with my trades resting on hundreds of hours of study and backtesting demonstrating the validity of my method, it was still difficult to pull the trigger and take the next trade at times. Knowing I had a demonstrated edge is what gave me the confidence to overcome mental angst and put on the next trade.
* **You must have a desire to succeed**. And second bullet is this: do you want to succeed? If you have a demonstrated edge and have a rock solid conviction and drive to succeed, then a lot of psychological issues take care of themselves. I remember the pain of sitting in a prolonged drawdown after losing several trades in a row. It was a defining moment for me. It is a unique pain that words can't quite capture. In the depths of the pain of losing trade after trade (and in the process worrying if I'd lose my job), I reminded myself that 1) I have an edge and 2) I really want to succeed at this. So I picked myself back up and took the next trade. And over the next few months I delivered some of my strongest returns and broke into new equity highs.

In my opinion, people get the cart before the horse in the territory of psychology. ""Trading gurus"" seem to suggest that if you get your mindset aligned, money will just flow into your account. That's simply not the case if the places in which you are buying and selling have zero demonstrated ability to actually make money. Step 1, get a demonstrated edge. Step 2, ensure you're able to act on that edge through proper psychology.

**An Edge**

The expected value equation is the foundation of trading. Put simply:

* **Expected value** = Win Percentage x Average Win Size + Loss Percentage \* Average Loss Size

If that equation is negative, you don't have an edge. If it's positive, you have an edge. If you play around with the math, you'll see that **win ratio or average win / loss size in isolation are irrelevant**. You can have a high win ratio with large losers or a low win ratio with large winners and have the exact same mathematical edge. The only thing you're varying is the distribution of your returns.

My strategy detailed above is a positive skew strategy. Lots of small losses and a few very large wins. You can adapt it by either larger stops or adding targets to change your distribution of returns. The underlying edge is real: markets trend and at certain points you can participate in them to outperform the baseline drift of the market. How you size your targets and stops shapes the ultimate distribution of returns you will receive as you capture this edge.

**Further Reading**

For those who have traded for a while, everything I said above probably clicks and makes sense. But if this was like me speaking an entirely different language, here's some books that are simply excellent for discretionary trading.

* **The Art and Science of Technical Analysis - Adam Grimes**. This book will carefully show you how to read market structure and give strategies for trading it. Grimes is the real-deal and his anti-hype levelheadedness is much needed in trading literature. If you can only afford one book, make it this one.
* **The Psychology of Trading - Dr. Brett Steenbarger**. Hands down the best psychology book out there in my view. Steenbarger (a professional psychologist who has worked at the institutional level of trading) is who fixed my thinking on trading psychology to where I focused on getting an edge first and foremost and then aligning my psychology so that I can act on my edge.

**Conclusion**

Take it or leave it, there's a complete discretionary trading strategy which was used at the professional level of the field of speculative FX trading. This is one of many approaches out there and if you're looking for a strategy, feel free to take this one and experiment with it. Best of luck in all of your endeavors.",99,"Great summary, this is the real strategy for all you newbies out there

>As you can see by my win ratio (32%), this strategy gets stopped out. A lot.

* Negative win rate and still profitable (yes, this is probably one of the only ways to consistently make money - you lose quite often but when you win you cover all your losses and some more - **forget** about strategies which have RR higher than 1:2 and winrate higher than 50%)

> I was spending 90% of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and 5-10% of my time actually trading.

* Finally. This is what trading is about - its a numbers game and **a lot** of awful, boring and mentally exhausting work. The actual trading / monitoring needs **very little** time. Entries are not that important (especially all those *sniper* entries - that is just **pure gambling** and nothing more), exit strategy is. Because noone knows how strong the trend will be once it starts. Who would say 10 days ago that gold would suddenly make **12000** pips in a week?

Now, the next step for this (or any) strategy would be to show people how to actually **optimize** the strategy (optimization = **finding optimal stop loss and take profit values** for the data set created by the strategy, expanding strategy to other assets). This can be easily done in any sheets program like excel or google sheets once you enter all the data from backtest.",We need more people to post stuff like this and not just PL screenshots. Thanks for showing people a potentially useful strategy.,I have a similar algo to trade like this even recently. Confirm it worked but it really depends on which instruments will get the most out of profit. For me it will be US30 and US100. Actually it will be the best if you can combine this breakout strategy with a mean reversion strategy to smooth out DD.
trading strategy,Forex,"Is ""feeling it"" a trading strategy?","I mean you always hear you need to have strategy, but I wonder if there is anyone else like me that kinda just feels it and enters based on gut feeling and some basic resistances.",4,"Some argue it's the only real way to be profitable.

trading strategy,Forex,"My forex trading strategy works, but doesn't. Any advice?","So the first time I traded with a strategy was with doyle exchange's course 2 years ago (uses supply/demand (S/D) zones with breaks of structure, liquidity and gaps as confluence). I found short term success, but didn't have strict rules/my psychology was bad, and holiday season lowered my win%. I fell in love with doyle's method of trading but struggled to make it work for me. And yes I tried his discord group for a while and long story short it didn't help enough.

I started only trading NAS. I focused on High probability (HP) S/D zones and liquidity grabs sweeps/reversals at the NYSE open, taking most of the setups that occurred. It's Sept 2022 ish and I started backtesting and building a trading plan. I found the app ""airtable"" and still use it to this day to record my trades. The more forward/backtesting I did, the more details I started paying attention to, the more confusing my research/strategy got. I wasn't recording effectively/tracking trade characteristics separately and therefor couldn't analyze the data very well, on top of realizing that trading the NYSE open is risky, has many fake-outs, and isn't back-testable since it goes back and forth in seconds.

I took a break during holiday szn and Feb 2023 I was back at the drawing board. I began looking at NAS, GU, EU, and AU, and how I could filter out the ""bad"" trades. I always traded the 5m, but now used 1H and 15m as confluence, looking at highs, lows(liquidity), and gaps as profit targets rather than amount of money. By march I realized the higher time frames confused me and I had no idea what a ""good"" vs ""bad"" trade was. I backtested NAS, EU, UJ, GU and every setup that occured from Jan-march 2023, constructed a trading plan, and by May 2023 was ready to forward test on only UJ and GU, but still record every trade from NAS and EU as well to have more data. 

My whole journey I had psychology trouble choosing what setups to take or avoid. I will attach a pic of my trading plan and an example or 2 (follow me on IG @ shambpagne if you wanna see summaries of my trading since MAy) but I was focused on removing the decision making in trading, using data to create rules that filtered my trades so I could simply take every trade I saw that fit the criteria, win or lose. My psychology since has been great. 700 recorded trades later, the strategy has been profitable the past 6 months on paper, averages around 20 trades a week, survived a slump in June/July w/o losing most of profits gained in April/May, and has been tweaked a lil bit based on the data I have analyzed. 

That all sounds good but Have I been profitable forward testing this strat? Not exactly. In May I was breaking rules and in most of June/July/august I was moving into an apt, travelling, working, and only back tested. I have forward tested all Sept 2023 and realized I haven't been tracking NEWS and it can only really be recorded when you forward test and see the affects real-time. So I'm sure a nice chunk of the profits I've recorded wouldn't exist bc of NEWS. I never took NEWS into account since it seemed to go in my favor almost just as much as it didn't. Since I've been forward testing and holding my trades through NEWS, I realize it's not realistic to think I will be able to consistently take profits in the mere seconds I have during a NEWs candle or that I won't lose more money than my SL says I will cus volatility. I decided to just start closing trades right before news hits but I also realized commissions are kinda fucking me over. I was up about 2.5% this past week on paper risking 1%/trade but only actually made 1%. There's no way of telling in the 700 trades I recorded how much profits would've been erased from commissions, but obviously a nice chunk it seems.

So now here I am, rethinking the past 6 months I have spent dialing in on this strategy I'm comfortable using, wondering how much of it was a waste. I don't really want to switch strategies and have another learning curve. My data shows that there's only a couple more ways to filter out bad trades and increase win% (around 60% rn), but I know the filtering would require me to start making decisions and could hurt my psychology and it honestly doesn't seem worth it since I would lose alot of profits on paper for a small win% increase. I have heard there are no commissions for trading NAS, but my strat straight up sucks on NAS and I can't go back to what I was doing before since it wasn't working. I understand swing trading would kinda eliminate this problem but I hate swing trading, I'm a scalper at heart.

I am going to keep forward testing the strat and I do still have confidence I will have enough profits in the long run to cover for all the commissions, but it is a bit troublesome. Anyone else dealt with this issue? Any advice on what to do moving forward assuming my strat won't provide enough in the long term? 

TLDR/ I trade Supply/demand zones using liquidity and gaps as targets on UJ and GU on the 5m. The strategy I have built around my psychology over the years takes about 20 trades a week and I'm recently realizing commissions might be my downfall.

In the picture, AGG = aggressive entry (tapping a zone), BOC = break of candle (reversal confirmation)",0,"I see you mention news few times. Often news doesn't change the trajectory but merely provides volatility or fuel to fire. Should always be aware of whats going on. Just a general observation but if you are having trouble with commissions, maybe you are overtrading. Have you tried increasing your time frame or limiting your trading in some way? Can take a long time of fine tuning to match your personality with the market when finding your way. Dedication, commitment, and patience can help guide you","there is this one article online that stood out to me completely and really helped me find the best setups, only take a supply and demand trade when the supply is extremely clear-im talking consecutive solid candle colors for the supply thats created and for the demand also that is created before entry. There must be a very clear demand that is created before considering entry. not all that liquidity crap and then some candle touching the zone. Must be clear as day and if its not clear on the 5min, could be more clear on the 1 min or 15min. But 5min is always the timeframe where I start. I won’t even take a setup if there is a candle of the opposite color interferring with the supply or demand. Ive never seen this talked about anywhere besides this only article on google and it definitely helps to not overtrade. Ive also started implementing daily bias so the direction of the s/d zone has to be in line with that because if its not, more than likely the setup will fail and not reach liquidity of the zone where i take profit. Since my setups have become so selective I do have to trade on more than one pair. I ignore news except nfp i have noticed any setup that looks good on that day does more than likely fail or zones just fail and don’t even get touched 

ive been following doyle for awhile on ig and watch his stories everyday to see if we had similar setups. ive pretty much figured out his strat just from studying s&d myself and his tips he says in his vids. some trades he does definitely has me scratching my head like when he takes a demand trade to a supply. I don’t even want to try getting my head wrapped around that lol but for exiting early I had to learn how to do that on my own as well as his vid describing that, if you did what he did you’d have a ton of losses and miss out on winning trades. It looks like he cuts them as soon as a candle goes in opposite direction before it even closes…. but thats how the market flows and if your setup is good most of the time that candle wont close above your entry candle

my stop loss is above the zone and i close early if any candle closes above the open of my entry candle- has cut my losses down by less than half instead of taking a full hit. your welcome for that one!!! lol

*ive been studying forex everyday since sept 2022, do not give up!! all the time and energy will be worth it. When people give up that’s usually when they are right on the verge of finding success","If you're not willing to go up a timeframe, which will give you fewer trades, you're probably going to need to get a better R:R somehow.

It's been my experience that trading anything under the 15m chart is way too much trouble than it's worth precisely because of commissions and spreads, and personally I rarely trade under the 1 hour.

I usually ignore news unless it's something of vital importance like a national bank making some huge announcement, even then I'm just slightly more cautious."

1) How did you hedge your option positions? Other options or delta/gamma hedging or a combination of both?

2) At what time of the day did you start trading? Right at the open, or did you wait until volatility has subdued slightly, maybe like 15 min after open? Or even later?

3) Where did you get your fair ivol skews/surfaces from? Did you have a data provider or did you calculate your own? If so, which method did you use (e.g. Heston + Residuals, Splines, ...)?

4) How many options did you trade concurrently, and where did you get your live options data from?

5) Did you trade way-OTM options (e.g. strike 1 puts or calls when spot is at something like 100+) as well? Or did you only concentrate on a certain moneyness range?

6) Did you have a database of historical ivols and if so, were they at all useful for trading options?"
options market,options,do options market makers trade underlying only regarding delta neutrality?,or may a market maker actually trade option to reach that delta neutral state. thanks,3,"We do both, and it often depends on what product you’re trading. In treasuries, delta is almost always hedged with futures. This is because the market moves so quickly that you need a system that automatically hedges options trades as they happen. I’ve never done market making in equities personally but I imagine it’s the same. In other markets like Eurodollars, you have a combination as there are liquid futures but also lots of resting orders to trade against. Since the futures don’t move as quickly as treasuries you can usually do either. That being said, it’s much much more common to just hedge via the underlying in most every product, though trading options for delta is not unheard of at all.","No we're not restricted. It's better to have access to more liquidity and that can be in options/futures/stock or elsewhere depending on what risks need to be hedged.

Remember market makers are almost never hedging each trade individually, it's usually on a portfolio basis.

I’ll try to answer questions about options trading, pay, work life balance, manual vs automated trading, any other questions feel free to ask.

Throwaway because some of my coworkers may recognize my username.

Edit: figured I’d add a pros and cons list...

Pros:
1. The work is highly stimulating and the days fly by (although I do work 10-12 hours a day Monday-Friday).
2. The compensation is very generous: a first year trader at my firm makes $150-$200k while a full time trader at my firm can make anywhere from $300k-$3M (partners can make more).
3. The culture is very work hard play hard which for me is a pro.
4. The people are extremely smart and push each other to work hard, generally trading firms recruit from ivy’s or schools with very strong academics (I personally did not go to an ivy but I did go to a good state school from which many trading firms recruit).

Cons:
1. This was also in the pros list but the days can be long and occasionally quite stressful.
2. Trading isn’t risk less and firms can go under especially when vol skyrockets like it did in March.
3. Not much diversity, most of my firm is white or Asian males. Not many women and not many people of color.
4. Some firms can be highly cutthroat and competitive, thankfully mine is not (that’s not to say it isn’t competitive, but people have the best interests of the firm in mind). However I’ve heard of other firms firing half of their new hires within 6 months of hiring if they don’t perform.",136,"Ok, so basically nothing that you do at your firm can actually be used or is relevant outside of it.

options market,options,Careful using Merrill Lynch MarketPro for options trading! Please read...,"I'm an ultra-high net worth client at Merrill Lynch for the record.  This morning I logged into the website as well as MarketPro and saw that I was down $17K... but the website showed I was down $51K... and the rep I was speaking to showed I was down $36K - this is upon hitting refresh at the same exact time... 

About six months ago I reported simple calculation errors in values of positions in options... I had some cash secured puts that showed I was up almost 300% when I was actually down quite a bit - I then saw a glaring mistake where they were multiplying a negative number by a negative number and inaccurately reporting gains when there were losses.  Merrill acknowledged and admitted these errors and said they would be corrected within 30 days.  Instead, they just removed the expanded drop-down data on options across MarketPro... it's been six months and it is still not corrected.  

This should not happen... let's say you're checking your bank account balance on an app and on a website at the same time - it should be reporting the same value, no matter what... I'm so frustrated with this, I don't know what to trust.  They've admitted these issues in writing and in recorded telephone communications... they've asked how much I've been damaged so that they can make me whole, but for me it's nearly impossible to calculate the losses from these calculation errors because of the nature of options premiums moving so much.

Can others check MarketPro and the website at the same time and see how close you are - especially if you're trading in options?  I'm curious to see if you have very different values being reported... I'm sitting at differences that range between 250-300% sometimes... this is truly terrifying.  I don't need dollar values, but would be very interested in knowing what % you're off, especially in your total options positions... 

I've reached out to two law firms in New York who are interested in representing me, and who may be interested in a class action lawsuit.  If this is happening for others, I'd love to know - it'll be pretty easy to see if there's a data mismatch - go to MarketPro, refresh your options positions at the same time as you're refreshing your holdings on the Merrill website... if it's wildly different as it is in my case, then we have a problem... right now I just hit refresh and I'm down $20,558 on MarketPro and $42,959 on the website.

options market,options,Overview of SPY Options Market for this week.,"The Fed is in a quandary.  Inflation isn't dropping as they would want to, and at the same time the US economy seems to keep pushing forward. Some investors believe that JPow's dovishness may turn back to hawkish mode. Last week, the AI battle between Microsoft's Sydney and Google's Bard turned into a rake-in-the-face contest. It seems that the tech rally is aimed at halting in its tracks.

This is what we can see as the general feel from the options markets:

* The long (50 day) Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) is about to catch up with the short (5 day) one. When this happens, the tendency is to go on a downward trend.

https://preview.redd.it/dha103wljjja1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a778c0920c595e14aa5e6f7e637e6e951f3294db

* The price momentum of SPY keeps cooling off. The momentum is calculated by subtracting the short DEMA minus the long DEMA. At the moment it seems that we are headed towards a negative momentum, characterised by a drop in price.

* The 50 day annualised volatility is at its lowest point since last August. Statistically, the tendency of the volatility will be to move up above the first purple line (20percentile line). We may be gearing up towards a higher volatility with  a downward pressure.

&#x200B;

* In the option markets expiring this Friday Feb 24, SPY continues being overwhelmingly bearish in sentiment. The sentiment has been trending slightly more positive since Feb 7th, however, there is just too much put open interest right now.

&#x200B;

* For SPY option contracts expiring Feb 24, we can see a very clear resistance level forming at strike $418. There are currently almost 30K open contracts at this point. The reason why this can be a resistance level is that, in general, market makers are at the other side of any opened trade. Since most traders are long traders (i.e. buyers of options) , it is reasonable to assume that at the other side of the 50K contracts are market makers. The game theory would lead us to see that the MMs will try to avoid printing 30K contracts (equal to 3M units of SPY) if they can somehow suppress the price enough. This is a subjective method to identify resistance levels and should be used with discretion. The reliability of this method gets stronger as we get closer to expiration date.

https://preview.redd.it/9obb0xfzljja1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04879509b443dfb682445f243876b99cb7f5c4cf

* For SPY option contracts expiring Feb 24, we can see that there are two significant support levels at $400 and $395 both with 40K put contracts open at each strike. The reasoning for calling it a support level follows a similar logic as with the resistance level, except that we use PUTS instead of CALLS to make this assessment. This is a subjective method to identify support levels and should be used with discretion. The reliability of this method gets stronger as we get closer to expiration date. It is also worth noting the gargantuan concentration of open put contracts at strike $360. This seems like an end of days type of play.

&#x200B;

* Next we evaluate what we refer to as a Delta Dam, this is also a subjective metric that should be used with discretion. A delta dam simply tell us how much money is required by market makers in order to fully hedge all the positions up to a specific strike. Remember that market makers do something called dynamic hedging, which means that they are constantly evaluating their positions and increasing or reducing the size of their hedges depending on market conditions. In the specific case for SPY options expiring on Feb 24, we can see that there is a jump of around $1.1B between strikes $417 and $418. If the strike is contested enough closer to expiration date, what we expect to see is that market makers will suppress the price of SPY instead of hedging it because the act of hedging calls itself pushes the price of the stock higher.

https://preview.redd.it/11447tm9njja1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=506a9fb7bf09d21a9025e53a46150eab1306bc94

&#x200B;

* For SPY CALL contracts expiring on Feb 24, we can see that market makers are currently hedging strikes $410 through $418  with more than 1.8M units of SPY. This is important because if the price of SPY starts to drop and isn't anywhere near $410 by Friday, then a lot of contracts for this strike will be closed, which will lead MMs to wind off their hedges which will further depress the price of SPY. This is also a subjective view based on hedging patterns by market makers.

I wouldn’t bet against technology this week x)
stocks,options,Best Covered Call Stocks,"I see a few others here are trading CCs. Who has some good ideas for CC candidates right now? Let's share some ideas with the numbers.

I trade well-known companies with low stock prices and relatively low margin requirements. I look for stocks where the bid for the weekly option is 1% or more of the current stock price.

As always, stocks and options involve risk and CCs are no different and this is not advice, just discussion.

Right now, X is trading at $28.66. The margin requirement (Etrade) is 35%. 100 shares would require about $1000 in capital. The $29.00 call expiring on 6/18 has a bid of .97. This is almost a 10% return instantly and another 3% or so if it assigns. The caveat here is that this is a near term high level for X and may come down. I would caution against a large position here, but X always pays a relatively good premium if you wait for it to come back down a bit from here.

AA is another one of my regular CCs. It is trading at $37.36. The margin requirement is also 35%, meaning a 100 shares would require capital of about $1300. The $37.50 call has a bid of .88. This is around a 6.5% return and another 1% if it assigns. Even though it pays a little less than X, this price level is less elevated than X right now.

I know these returns sound like nothing compared to WSB short squeezes, but these are weekly returns and they add up quick. I usually have 2000-3000 shares of X in my portfolio and regularly collect $1000-$2500 in premium and extra when it assigns. I use it to pay for some options and shares in WSB stocks like WKHS. 

I think it is important to have an income strategy as well as a capital gains strategy. Use your income strategy to pay for the more speculative plays, it hurts less if they don't work out!",372,"I like CC, but I think selling PUTS would still be a better play. If you get assigned, then you can do CC, collect premiums both way","I own 3400 shares of AHT at $5.23. I sold 34 covered calls for July 16 at $10 strike.

I plan on holding share for a very long time.","I wheel 2000 shares of X, cost basis 25 USD, will be called away this Friday at 28 USD."

CSPs, CCs, strangles etc.",0,AAPL,"In my opinion I wouldn't sell CSP with an account that small.  If you stick to reasonable stocks, you will be using 75-100% of your portfolio on one stock should you be assigned (e.g. RKLB, SOFI, F, CHPT, CLF... all in the $14-$20 range).

I started with a $1,000 account not that long ago and used PMCC's to build it up and then started selling CSP's when I had enough to cover 2-3 positions.","I would start with either selling credit spreads or PMCC with that capital size. Build it up until you can afford selling CSP/CC. The reason is because with the capital size, you’re not going to have a lot of options when it comes to selling CSP/CC and most likely need to settle with high risky volatile stock. Unless you truly don’t mind owning 100 shares of those companies at worst case. The thing with spreads is you can sell spreads on good quality companies like FAANG and value.

stocks,options,Overbought stocks fall faster and harder than oversold stocks rise?,"I can't empirically prove this (although I haven't researched it extensively - not even sure where to start), but after years of observation it seems to me that when a stock that's overbought reverses, it tends to fall harder and faster than an oversold stock starts to climb.

[**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MRjupIWNNAO4fdKkgW9QM\_IUpPrduHtKz\_JiS8JUUA/edit#gid=1116024769**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MRjupIWNNAO4fdKkgW9QM_IUpPrduHtKz_JiS8JUUA/edit#gid=1116024769)

**It consists of two sheets:**

1. **Tracker:** A way to track various stocks and automatically pull financial ratios and data.
2. **Fundamental Analysis:** Pulling financial statement data, ratios and key metrics for individual tickers for analysis.

Everything is automated, the only things you have to change are the tickers and data points you want to pull.

**How to:**

1. **Open it, go to File and click Make a Copy**
2. **Follow the instructions on the ""Guide"" tab**

**Use the sheet in this way:**

1. Add new tickers to column A of staticData
2. Sort column A of staticData by A-Z after adding new tickers
3. Add the ticker you want to analyze to A1 of fundamentalAnalysis

If  you end up ever adding new rows to Tracker or staticData you'll need to  make sure the formulas are applied to each column, do this like you  would in Excel, drag the cells down.

stocks,options,Puts on oil and gas stocks.,"Historically, the price of oil falls pretty dramatically during a recession. And oil and gas stocks tend to rise and fall with a pretty good correlation to the price of oil. It looks like the market has started to price in a fall in oil price. But it should continue to go in a down trend for the next few months at least right? Puts on oil and gas stocks with expiration a few months out still have pretty low IV. Is that easy money? Or am I missing something?

It’s possible the price of oil could go up a bit longer. But if you buy an expiration at least a few months out, it seems like pretty good probability it’ll be in a down trend?",86,"The war is still going on, demand is high, supply is low. Powell said the interest rate hikes won’t lower prices. Bidens gas tax won’t affect it either imo.","The oil stocks are valued as if oil fell a hell of a lot more.  The PE on oil companies is generally very low.  Like less than 10 and forward around 5.  They have tons of free cash flow, authorized buybacks (which seems like a good time to do now), and pay hefty dividends. They make money when the price of oil is much lower.  The time to buy puts on oil was two weeks ago.  Buying them now that they are down 25% is too reactionary.  I have tons of calls on oil stocks because they are bargain prices and can rip at any time. They are already priced for recession.  If we get a bear rip in the next week they will move a lot. Check out S&P futures and WTI futures right now. They are moving in lock step temporarily.","I would caution attempting to extrapolate historical trends into this current economic climate. Too many unique variables currently exists. Never before had global energy supply been this contrained. And, there still seems to be no material decrease in demand.

The only thing you got going for you is that Russia is selling their oil for $83/barrel. And they seemed to have cornered the Asian market. This would suggest that the market price would need to come down to ~$90/barrel to compete with Russian supply."
stocks,options,Finding stocks and set ups.,"So i am a forex trader but is slowly transitioning to stocks. I notice that everyday people have different set ups and stocks they are looking at and it makes me wonder how do you guys find these different stocks/set ups daily? Do you guys just have 20-50 stocks on y’all watchlist that y’all repeatedly trade? Do you guys use scanners? Twitter? 🤔 Im asking because in forex, you can trade the same currency, commodity and indices everyday and succeed",6,"I sell premium mostly on individual equities and have a watchlist of around 40 stocks that are mostly large cap blue chips. And yes, I repeatedly trade the names on my watchlist and I don't touch anything else outside of that. These are companies that I feel comfortable holding on to for an extended period of time if necessary.","Different people do very different things. I'm not a daily trader any more, but i have about 40 tickers in my watch list.","You can do both, it depends on your strategy.  It comes down to what inefficiency you're targeting and how you capitalize on it.  For a simple example, SPY only traders could be targeting a tendency for an index to be skewed, while a single/multi stock trader could have a strategy around each certain stock's earnings.  The type of portfolio you want to build varies depending on the situation.

It's like targeting macro/micro events in forex."
stocks,options,Best stocks for covered call/wheel strategy?,Is there a way to find stocks (around 100$) that pays good premium for covered calls and cash secured puts ?

What stocks do you guys use for wheel strategy?,33,[deleted],"I'm selling calls on Amazon right now and I think the returns are okay. But I've also not been doing this very long. One correction I've made to my approach is to make sure I sell the call when the stock appears to be going up in value.

Another stock that I'm having luck with is UNH, though it is very expensive and outside the price range you indicated in your post.

It's flattening and inverting. This is signaling a recession. This was what was going on with the bond markets the other day, what this means is the FED/BigMoney is pulling out. That's why we're seeing a correction. Moving money into oil most likely or other actual assets. The natural yield curve has probably been inverted for a while, but the short end of the curve has been artificially suppressed by the Fed. We're just starting to see it now that they are tapering.

Doesn't mean freak out just yet or anything, but definitely think about being a bit more guarded if you are bullish. I would watch all of the banks to see what happens with them, definitely the European banks aswell. If things get really bad, you could see a domino effect.

*Personally,* ***I am growing bearish*** *over all of this and just want to get it all over with. I will be looking at SPY/QQQ puts tomorrow. If we go up in the morning like we did today for that fake out, I will grab some at roughly the 0.20-0.30 cent range. Usually the calls/puts within a 5 dollar range work for this since that is the ATR SPY puts out. It's hard to tell today without knowing how tomorrow will be, but usually the ones worth that much at the top end up flying 500-1000% 0dte. I am going to try to wait till we have a +2 std dev move upward/downward before I grab them. Don't know if the morning fake out will get us that high, but also this play can be reversed if for some reason we start moving upwards. Set stop losses. Move them up right off the rip when you are in the green. Don't get greedy. Do this and* ***YOU WILL MAKE A PROFIT*** *even if you get stopped out. If you get stopped out. Wait, and rebuy another option.*

This play is also separate in relation to the above mentioned stuff. I am buying options regardless of what happens.

**This is an extremely risky play and I do not recommend you jump into this if you are not familiar with how 0dte options work.**

I am only going to throw a few hundred at this and see what happens. It's been working out great all week so far though. Be aware tomorrow is Option Expiration for LEAPS that were bought 2 years ago.

Today we closed at an important MA line on most major stocks, a critical one, some even below. Tomorrow is opex, playing options could be very risky tomorrow with everything.

Stay frosty boys and girls.

&#x200B;",527,"Howdy, FI analyst here.

This isn't a yield curve inversion. We measure the 'curve' as gaps between short dated and long dated yield such as the 2s10s, 5s10s, 10s30s. It's when those measures invert it's a bearish signal. 

It is also wise to note the varying liquidity at different parts of the curve and the investors which participate in each maturity segment. ie yields in the 30y may simply be stale / dormant due to low trading volume given it is mainly insurance companies in this part hedging liabilities, not the average active fund.","🤔 I can see how it’s concerning, but a much stronger indicator of a recession is when short-term yields rise above long-term yields. That indicates that the fed has increased rates too high and/or investors are fleeing to treasuries for safety.

The 20 year yield rose over the 30 at the very end of October, shortly before the fed announced that it would start to taper QE in November. QE distorts the treasury market by holding down yields, so tapering & investors’ expectations of falling bond prices may be part of the cause for the rate inversion.","20yr is new and an anomaly, it’s been “inverted” for  like *four months. A legitimate spread to watch would be the 7yr - 10yr spread since it is currently the flattest on the curve

Price today is about $410/share.  Sell a covered call,  1/19/2024, $415 strike, and you will receive   $11k in option premium + dividends + any appreciation in stock price up to $415/share.  It’s more than a 12% annual return.  If SPY goes down, assuming doomsayers are correct,  below $415 at expiry you keep the shares, option premium, and dividends.  If above $415, you pocket the proceeds from the assignment and keep the premiums and dividends you would have received. 

You can decide what you want to do closer to expiration."
year,options,"Quick year recap / $115,789.10 profits since June","Started with 30k capital in June. Withdrew 25k this past month to pay for a car.

My first trades were HTZ Bought 6 Oct 16 6C @ 1.48 $888 and H Bought 2 Aug 21 70C @ 5.40 $1080.

My most profitable strategies were short strangles, short puts, occasionally short calls and deep delta long calls.

My biggest losses were earning plays on TGT and BYND. Lost 10k/27k respectively. The lesson I learned was to be consistent with my losers, so cut em loose sooner.

Some other things that helped me this year were patience, risk management, exploring new strategies, keeping a watchlist and looking out for patterns/trends. The options sub was my #1 source of education when I started. I always asked questions in the noob thread, and probably combed through 80% of it’s history to learn as much as I can. Very thankful for people like redtexture, papacharlie9, maxcapacity, esinvests (Erik) for being mentors to new traders like myself.

I do know I am still an amateur. I will still be a regular on the noob thread, but I wanted to share a bit of my story to cap off the year. I have no friends who actively trade the market :(

year,options,Losing for 5 years straight,"Started off in 2018 trading penny stocks to get my feet in the water and then robinhood released options a few months later and I went right in. The first two years of trading options I probably blew atleast 20 small accounts ranging from 1k-2k. I had no clue what I was doing back then, I was mostly gambling and wasn’t taking the time to learn what options really were. 2021-2023 I started to educate myself about TA, supply/demand and joining alert groups and discords and learning with a community which has really helped. I was making gains consistently but when it was time to finally have a losing trade I would just not let myself have a red day and wipe out months of gains in one day. I would have 1 month of straight green trades and when the inevitable losing day comes I just never take the small loss and move onto the next. 

I also never really used hard stop losses and relied on a mental stop which 80% of the time I would keep moving the stop loss down and average down on the losing trade. There were multiple times where I averaged down heavy on a horribly losing trade and it turns out to be a huge win later on which is a a horrible habit I’ve required. I feel like I lack consistency, discipline, and emotional control both in trading and irl. I lack consistency irl with simple things like taking a multivitamin daily, going to the gym, or keeping my room clean or something. I lack discipline also such as cleaning my room sparingly or going to work late sometimes, not completing things before a deadline etc. I know with trading you have to be pinpoint perfect with following rules and I was always a rule breaker in many aspects of life. 

I’m not sure why after 5 years of trading I just haven’t given up yet, atleast I have super strong sense of motivation. I love trading, looking at charts at night and reading trading related news. I just need to fix these simple yet gigantic issues that are stopping me from becoming a successful trader. Just last month I had my biggest day gain of 12k and I slowly gave it all back within a week. Why? Because after that huge gain the next trades were small wins such as 300-600$ gains and that didn’t please me anymore apparently. 

Anyone have any books or anything helpful that would help me become more self controlling and disciplined in normal areas of life which I can then transfer into the market? Thank you",87,Human psychology plays a lot bigger role in trading than skills,Sounds like a gambling addiction,"A man

year,options,My expérience after a year,My experience after a year: I have been selling puts for a year now.  I started with 5000€.  went down to 4650 then went back up to 5400 and I am at €5150.  my mistakes were not to concentrate on selling options where I had little loss but to buy shares in anticipation to sell calls and that's where I took the beatings.,25,"I know it's not glorious to make 3% in one year, but I started without any knowledge of the options.  believe that I will have to wait a certain time before increasing the size of my account and going to 10k€ for example, I have 50k available.","Selling Put options and allowing them to be exercised should always be part of your plan to begin with.

When I first started selling Puts, one of the stocks was Macy's (M). Macy's was a relatively inexpensive stock (at the time was trading at around $30) but the premiums matched AAPL's Put premiums. 

One day I was assigned shares, which I thought was no big deal.  Instead of just selling back the shares for a loss, I talked myself into holding on to them.  After all, this was a great company, right?

A year and a half later and my shares were still at a $20 loss.  Because of the drop, covered calls were out of the question as I would consistently have to monitor to ensure I wasn't assigned for a loss.

I eventually just ripped the bandaid off and sold my shares at a loss.  I used the loss as both a learning experience and tax write off.  As a matter of fact, five years later and Macy's stock is still well below where I was assigned, and even lower than where I sold my shares at.

Now, I never sell a put on a stock or ETF I don't want to own.  And, I always have insurance just in case I'm assigned and the stock or ETF drops like a rock. 

If you want to generate similar income per month without the fear of assignment, look at trading credit spreads.  They have protection built into them.  So if you are assigned, you will have another option contract that allows you to get out of them for minimal loss.

If you are in the US and you want to save on the capital gains you're taxed on your options trading account, look at SPX.  They are cash settled and you can't be assigned early.  Plus, your gains are taxed at a 60/40 split.  Meaning that 60% of your gains are taxed at Long term capital gains and 40% at short term.  All other profits from options trading are taxed at short term capital gains, which is essentially your income tax bracket.","Better than a 3% loss. Keep plugging along, friend"

This article has a lot of implications for options and not just 'meme' stocks. Basically, this is saying all options are potentially manipulated. It has sent a chill down my spine about options in general. I've made some good money in options but also lost a lot too and more recently. 

How many times have I seen a stock trending upward and suddenly reverse course only to end up finishing the week right on top of max pain. 

How many times must I see OBV barely move and yet a stock is tanking. 

I will watch level 2 and see the bid filled with way more orders than the ask and yet the stock is tanking.

In the case you cite, you have just bid the price up by $0.52 in order to avoid getting assigned. The problem is that you're now holding stock at an artificially high price. The stock price will fall back to its natural level as soon as you withdraw your bid. It turns out the economics wont be favorable to the intervener.

Now it's a different story for cash-settled index options, particularly, the VIX. It's harder to manipulate an index price than a stock, but there are some nits in how the VIX itself is calculated. Certain small bids in the wings can influence which strikes are included in the calculation and move the index up and down.

Buying weekly OTM calls have as much chance of paying off as lottery tickets.  You have to have a really big move in the price to overcome the effect of theta decay, especially when you get close to expiration.

Theta is the rate of decay of the option price as you get closer to expiry.  It really accelerates over the last weeks and months of the option.

If you're like the rest of us and have no clue when the crash will happen, you'll end up paying insurance premiums at some interval. It's pretty much like car or house insurance. You don't know when or if your car or house will be totaled, but you pay for insurance every year anyway. It's the same with buying long puts against a future crash. You could throw a lot of insurance premium down a hole without any guarantee of getting any of that money back. And for the most part, you hope that you don't get any money back, right?

As a real-life example, I've been running a continuous bear play against KRE. The next SVB bank implosion is going to happen sooner or later, for as long as the Fed keeps raising interest rates, so I can't tell you when the next bank will implode, but I'm 99% certain one or more will.

strategy,options,Does anyone use weighted averages to determine the viability of a trading strategy?,"This logically makes sense to me, but I don’t see or hear it discussed much. 
From what I have found so far most ICs have negative weighted averages but vertical spreads have positive ones.

For example,
Let’s look at a short vertical spread on SPY (3NOV). For simplicity’s sake, I’m going to assume only max profit and max loss, and ignore the small probability that it ends up between the strikes.

Spread 1: 
Sell 418 Call (Prob OTM 74.87%)
Buy 419 Call 
Spread credit/Max Profit .29
Max Loss $71

Weighted average:
.7487 x $29 = $21.7
(1-.7487 x $71) = $17.8
$21.7 - $17.8 = $3.9

So statistically my average gain on this trade would be $3.9

When I do the math for ICs, it usually comes out negative.

Is this a good way to vet potential strategies, or is relying on these probability numbers too unreliable?",4,"Yes, thinking about your exposure (probability x payoff) is the correct way to evaluate a given structure. However there are two flaws:

1. You’re considering your exposure in a discrete space, and a really low dimensional space at that. Ideally you’d do this in a continuous fashion across all possible outcomes. 
1. The probability of profit you’re getting from your broker is based on a flawed Gaussian assumption. It’s useful to an extent for reasoning about trades but does not reflect reality. If volatility, interest rates, etc… stayed static then it would be closer to reality, but they don’t and it isn’t.

As for the iron condors, the detail your discrete weighted average is missing is that the values closer to the center (between the two short strikes) are the most probable values, and probability of outcomes decrease as you move further away from those in either direction.","Yes, I have definitely considered this (but I am far from an expert lol)",Expected value is used by many - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expected-value.asp
strategy,options,covered call strategy clarification,"All,

For some odd reasons, I can't seem to understand clearly about the P/L diagram of covered call strategy. I always thought that covered call strategy is for bearish because the goal is to collect the premium and you keep the stock this means that you want the current stock price is below the strike price. so that you can keep the premium and run while keeping underlying stock. (income generation) However, it says this strategy is for bullish strategy and I can't seem to make an understanding of the P/L diagram clearly. Maybe I am thinking strangely about this whole concept. Can someone point me what part I am not understanding clearly. I feel like I understand when to deploy this strategy under what conditions but this P/L diagram always confuses me in some weird way. If someone can break it down to easy to understand the diagram then much appreciated!",1,"Covered calls are preferred when you are mildly bullish - expecting some upside but not a huge rally. The premium adds income but limits your profit if the stock really rallies. In a very bearish case, you would not want to cap your profit at the strike price. And in a very bullish case, you miss out on large gains above the strike.   

If stock price really goes south you will NOT get any premium if you sell too OTM. and there is a risk of your stock getting called away if you sell closer to the money.  thats why its suited if you are mildly bullish but not overaly bullish.",I use weekly CC’s to generate income. My goal is 2% a week but I rarely sell one with less than a 1% profit. Of course that should only be done on strong but less volatile stocks. Example I bought 200 shares of NVDA at 226 in Mar and sold the 250’s for $22 the stock went up over 280 at expiration so it cost me 8$+ a share but fortunately I was able to roll them up to 300 at a 3$ cost and I’ve had to do it several more times but NVDA has been a beast and even though I’ve made more than 75% in less than 6 mos I would’ve made 100%+ just buy and hold. The option premiums are so high though it has helped a few times like before earnings it went from 480ish to 405 and then right after earnings when it peaked out at $520 and then promptly dropped to $450ish. Each huge down draft I’ve bought back the options and sold ones further out and have profited but on all the rest of my portfolio I’ve been generating income to live on from selling CC’s. Dividends just aren’t enough for me to live on but the 1 to 2% a week is working out well (so far),"I'm not sure what diagram you are referring to or your source.  Your thinking is generally on track.  I own a bunch of AAPL.  I was bearish in the 150s earlier this year and sold a 175 CC.  I sold an OTM CC and it bullishly shot past my 175CC.  Yes, I collect the premium but lose on the  gains past 175 plus premium.  I was weakly bullish/bearish and those results would have yielded the premium and not getting my AAPL shares called away.  It went strong bull mode and I either miss out gains or have to buy back my CC at a more expensive price to keep my shares."

While they have been given this time anything could happen ie. someone could buy them out or maybe restrictions were lifted. Along with the market moving up and up HTZ resisting 0.80 mark and decided that it will not go down most likely. On top on Friday market moved up 1000 pts which basically dragged every stock on the exchange up making me close my trade in green.

trading,options,Quit trading,"Hello whoever took the time to read this. I don’t really know how to start this, but  whatever I just really need to vent and have someone listen. 
I was slapped with the hand of reality yesterday after a fight with my girlfriend. She’s felt that since I’ve started trading which was a little over a year and a half ago, I’ve become less patient & irritable. Ultimately being the reason why our relationship has been falling apart. 

I’m the type of person that when I get really into something, I try to be the very best at whatever it is. Thus this is the mindset that I took when learning the ins and outs of trading options. 
Like most, I started out on Robinhood, and as I felt more comfortable I opened an account with TD Ameritrade. I started with around a thousand dollars which coming for me is a kind of a stretch for me at the time.

Fast forward I became absorbed by the markets & trading. On the weekends I researched and planned plays for the week & I couldn’t wait for Monday to get back in there and trade. I love trading, it excites me it’s fun, it makes me feel like I’m doing something with my life. However, the emotions that came with it seemed to take a toll on me & my relationship. The losses would  impact the mood for the rest of my day, I would just be really upset at myself for  not being smarter. She would constantly support me day in and day out, (not financially, but emotionally) 
I would take time off to get my head straight and then give it another go.

Nonetheless, history repeats itself & nothing changed. I’d still get upset with myself over the losses & would start to sell some of my personals to make enough to keep trading. I know I’ll probably get shit for having a gambling addiction, I just would have the mindset of not quitting, and not giving up. Not wanting to become a failure... 

All said & done, she finally told me that giving up trading all together was just not for me, & i just feel useless. Aside from working my shity job, I don’t have anything that I can put my mind and energy into that makes me feel productive, and good, like I’m working towards something.

underlying stock price,options,Buying options considering it’s underlying stock price,New to options. Say I analyse a stock at 100 and think it will go up. I place my stop at 90 and profit target at 115. I buy the call option for that stock at an at-the-money strike when the stock is at 100. And exit the option when the stock hits either 90 or 115. Is this a viable thing to do?,2,Not without learning your Greeks. Sounds like you should just play the underlying for the pure delta exposure.,"If you are asking about the mechanics of order placement, it depends on whether your broker supports triggers on something other than the call price itself. Many don't, so you'll have to check.

If your broker supports setting stops and limits on the underlying price, you are good to go.

Except that you shouldn't go. Don't trigger on the underlying in the first place. If your call's value goes **up** when the stock prices goes **down**, you wouldn't want to stop out on the stock price. Also, your call price can go **down** when the stock goes **up**, aka IV crush, so you don't want to exit then either.

Also, don't use stops. Options can lose more than whatever your stop price is and then recover that amount and more the next day. So stops can act as profit prevention as much as loss prevention. Just use alerting and monitor your positions daily for the loss side of the equation. You can set a limit order to close GTC for the profit side.","I'm not saying it's a good idea, but, to answer the question: Yes, if the broker supports contingent orders with multiple OR conditions. Then the condition is set to be the underlying last price being below 90 or exceeding 115 to trigger a market sell to close order on the call.

I'm trying it in Fidelity's condition trade screen and it will let me place that kind of order. You have to put in the option as the option symbol though such as -JEPI220218C61.

Of course the underlying last price might hit those during extended hours but the option can be sold only during regular hours (except for those that trade 15 minutes after close such as SPY).

Now of course I would do a market sell to close **only** if the options typically have a tight bid/ask spread such as AAPL or SPY. If the bid/ask spread is wide or there's low liquidity doing a market order is just asking to get a bad fill. 

As others mentioned having an understanding of the Greeks is good as underlying price is not the only driver of option prices. If you buy to open the call when IV is high such as right before earnings, and then IV drops right after, then even if the underlying price is the same the price of the call might drop by 30%."

scenario: bought CLNE 15c for Jan '22 today at $2.90, probably early afternoon-ish ET timeframe...share price up, option price down at close (i know they are not inexorably linked, price-wise, but it got me to thinking about this question)",6,Cant you just look at your purchase date/time stamp and compare it to the stock price (yahoo finance) at that time?,"I've been wishing for years that Fidelity would stamp the underlying price at time of purchase.

More often than not, you’re dealing with a market maker. When you sell a put, a market maker is typically buying it from you. Buying the put from you adds negative deltas to the MM’s book.

I’ve noticed that sometimes some calls’ prices shoot up while the underlying stock price is down. For instance, $TSLA 27/8/2021 calls with strikes $1,115 and $1,150. Both are significantly higher while the stock price is down 3%. I’ve seen this pattern for many times in options chains. I always thought call options prices are closely related to stock price increases, and the same for puts. I can’t seem to make sense out of this. 

Any help in understanding this would be appreciated. 

Thanks in advance.",2,"You have to understand the different components of an options price. 

In this case the rise in the price is due to an increase in implied volatility (IV). Essentially, investors expect more volatility, so the price of the options goes up. In this cas, the change in IV was so big that it outweighed the drop in price in the underlying.

You should take a look at delta (change of price of the option for a 1$ move in the underlying) and Vega (change of pride of the option for a 1point move in IV)

Effects of implied volatility happen after earnings for example. After earnings there usually is a large drop in IV. Let’s imagine a company reported earnings but the price didn’t move. You would see puts and calls get hammered because of the decrease in IV, even if the stock price didn’t move that much.","That’s why after a huge dump it is better to wait for the next day to buy leaps calls (even tho vega is small with 2 year leaps, it is still a good discount).

IV is so high that it pushes the call option price higher even tho the underlying goes to shit.","Dums-dums think Tesla can only go up, therefore it going down looks like a dip buying opportunity: dum-dums buy OTM Leaps then get IV crushed when Tesla goes flat for a month. Great to buy straddle on when IV goes down so you can sell both calls and puts on days like this. More technical Vega explanation, but ultimately the dum-dums are the reason."

underlying stock price,options,somewhat experienced 20 yo options trader. Earnings with the underlying stock price in hundreds.,"I am currently trying to develop my own options trading strategy and would like insight, recommendations, and answers to my questions. 

Overview: I have noticed how some particular stocks, stocks over $250 a share, can sometimes move wildly on earnings reports, good or bad. I first learned and notcied this on Lululemon’s earnings. $LULU dramatically moved when they posted their earnings not to long ago. You could have gotten one call for 3.50 and a put for 3.50. The next day, the call cashed for $3k and obviously the put worthless. I then used this strategy of buying an ATM call and ATM put when Costco had their recent earnings. I got burned on that play due to the underlying not moving dramatically overnight. After that loss, I learned to apply this strategy to Stocks in their $250+ AND are historically known for large price movement to offset the theta burn the next day and change of IV 

My current strategy: Netflix $NFLX earnings are 10/19 AH and the underlying falls into my two categories: high price of stock and historically known to move. Overall, I’m bullish on $NFLX for earnings. They are anticipated to have a strong Q3 with high subscriber growth, especially in Asia and Europe. The stock may explode as well, if they make a major gaming update. However in my strategy, I will buy 1 ATM Put and 1 ATM call 10 minutes prior to market close on 10/19. Since I’m bullish as well, I would also buy 5X OTM 8%+ lottos all expiring the same week. 

Is the only way I loose if the stock stays the same ? If there is no volatility and no change in stock price? If the stock tanks, my ATM put would print because of the delta, and how many dollars it’s down, and the potential increase in IV even after there is no more “uncertainty”. Due to the underlying tanked hard and fast, the IV could certainly increase and not “crush”. That out would save my worthless call and my worthless OTM calls and break even and may profit. Then if Netflix moons for earnings like it did in January, I’m stupid rich right? LMK what I’m missing. Thank you !",3,[removed],Buying straddles and strangles is really the worst way to play er. Unless you notice the implied move is oddly low. Statistically if you sold straddles and strangles you’d have a much higher win rate.,"Most of the time straddle buyers lose. In most large studies, straddle buyers lose about 66 percent of the time.

The very few data points you noted are not statistically significant. 

What I tend to observe is cycles. A few big names have big moves, premiums get bid up. Next cycle is mostly small moves, so straddle sellers become more aggressive.

Earnings tend to be a crapshoot, slight edge to straddle sellers. However some of losers can be astronomical. On the other side, it is those very few huge moves that keeps the straddle buyers interested."
underlying stock price,options,Calculating Option Price From Underlying Price?,"If this belongs in beginner I apologize. I’m wondering how to calculate an options price based on the price of the underlying security.

Mainly curious because I use TradingView which doesn’t seem to have options but I’d like to get a notification when an option hits a certain price. The only way I can think of (without using another service) is to receive a notification for the underlying price. 

Thanks in advance!",0,"Option pricing is rather complicated, in fact it won a Nobel prize! Look up the options pricing formulas. There are many factors.","You can do this with the black scholes model and a few assumptions, although it will be janky and incorrect.

Take your option price and calculate the greeks.  A simple calculator to do that can be found here [https://vindeep.com/Derivatives/OptionPriceCalc.aspx](https://vindeep.com/Derivatives/OptionPriceCalc.aspx)  


the ones you need to care about are the delta and the gamma.  


Then your formula is Price\_final = price\_initial + delta\*change\_in\_underlying + 1/2 \* gamma \* (change\_in\_underlying)\^2.  Solve for the change in underlying that gets you what you want.  


Note, that formula is a good approximation when the price change is small, and the time period is quick (so there is no theta decay).  In case you're wondering, delta and gamma are the first and second derivatives of the option price with respect to the underlying, so you are in effect just using the definition of delta and gamma and a taylor expansion from calculus.","You’d have to look up the Black Scholes option price formula. You need interest rate, implied volatility, dividends (if any), underlying price, time to expiry and so on. Even then expected future events (like earnings announcements) can cause an unpredictable asymmetry in the put/call spreads that get attributed to differing degrees of implied volatility"

Win rate = 100%

Total captured = $1,498.51

**Observations**

Anecdotally, it seems that the longer that these went, the more difficult that they were (or, at least, the more scared I got). Scalp 10 was notorious; I was down by $377 at one point, but held on and pulled the trade out with a win. One of the others (I forget which) saw me down about $230, but I eventually won that one, too.

The difference between winning and losing a scalp can come down to a split second, so even if someone were sitting next to me and trying to mimic my every move, they might have had losses. There's also a certain blind aspect to it: I was buying a call contract using a limit order, always below the bid price (never the midpoint), and selling at the market price (because the trades generally happened too quickly to even think about using a sell limit order). This only makes sense to do in a highly liquid stock with lots of options volume.

During one of the days, the underlying stock was in a downtrend. I made money by using RSI and MACD, using a very short holding time, and relying on micro-bursts of momentum.

In general, my success was made possible by the fact that the stock I chose was trading in a very, very, very narrow range during the very brief intervals in which I held it, and it seemed to oscillate above and below the mean price in that interval, like a sine wave. Thus, I could use the MACD as a pretty reliable signal for buying and selling.

Psychologically, this took a lot of energy and focus. Monday trading lasted one hour and eight minutes. Tuesday lasted one hour, eleven minutes, and thirty-seven seconds. Wednesday lasted nineteen minutes and twenty-three seconds. On Monday and Tuesday, I just couldn't handle any more trading, even though I won every trade. On Wednesday, a day that I hadn't wanted to trade but snuck in those two trades, I didn't want to push my luck; I did it to top things off. I really hate options scalping, as a strategy, because it's so intense, but if you need cash right this minute, it's probably your best bet. My favorite strategy, on the other hand, is shorting put options, with an expiration date several months out.

I strongly advise against trying something like this on a Thursday, and you absolutely can't do it on a Friday, due to theta decay (and gamma and vega), or you'll lose your shirt! Although I've never held a scalp overnight, I've considered the possibility of buying on a Monday and waiting possibly three more days, if that's what it took, for a substantial gain. In this way, with a bunch of days to rely upon, you might give yourself multiple opportunities to win, should one day not prove favorable. I prefer an intra-day scalp, though, because you never know what could happen in after-hours trading.

I honestly don't know if winning all sixteen of the trades, consecutively, was (almost entirely) dumb luck or (hardly any) latent skill, but it seems unlikely, from a statistical perspective, that it was entirely dumb luck. I don't plan on trying this again anytime soon, either way. I like to design winning options plays very carefully, and take lots of time executing them for slow, easy wins, so it was interesting to try to emulate the scalpers. Everything considered, I'm just grateful for the unexpected success using a style that isn't natively mine.

What are others' experiences with scalping? Do you have any tips?

Artem",268,What underlying and how many contracts?,"You certainly can do scalps on thursdays and fridays. Most people scalping SPY are using the closest expiration date. But the length that you held some of these would be too long. You want to ride momentum and get out before it slows down.

Scalping the open on SPY you have to be very fast, which means taking profits fast and closing losers even faster.",Never tried doing this but you sure made it look attractive! Congrats mate!

HERE's the upside!

The president will most likely recover with or without the drug, and it will not be clear if it helped at all. To me, that hedges against sell off in the event of his demise.

time,options,"AMC: An imploding time bomb, and put spreads to capitalize","Hi Everyone,

For everyone considering an investment in GME's little sister - wanted to open the floor to a few facts and why AMC is not GME and how ""big finance"" has already dumped on retail investors, and are about to celebrate big plays for round 2.

Facts-to-date:

1. In the midst of this mania, Silver Lake & Mudrick Capital, two scummy vulture investment firms have already quietly extracted almost **$1 billion** dollars from retail investors. See [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E) and [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/mudrick-capital-gains-200-million-on-amc-gamestop-in-wild-week). These guys are celebrating the best play they've ever made on their yachts in the Hamptons right now... to put the size of this into perspective, the value of every single AMC share combined was **$500M** two weeks ago
2. Many here have said ""well I don't care, AMC share price is 'only' \~20% above pre-COVID times"" have it completely wrong and are forgetting how many shares AMC have been issued - there are currently \~3X as many outstanding shares, and the current market cap is **400%** of what it was pre-COVID. See [here](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap). Adding to the pain, the moves above added even more shares to dilute the value (though elimination of debt does have some positive EV offset)
3. Unlike GME, there aren't the same conditions for a widespread short squeeze. Short interest between 15-30% depending on how you [count](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355987915105566721) it, multiple funds involved, and plenty of days and liquidity to cover.

**The kicker:** There are BIG incentives to keep prices elevated in the short term. AMC has already stated they're in the midst of considering whether to [issue more shares again and dilute you further](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-capitalraise-exclusive/exclusive-amc-entertainment-explores-new-capital-raise-amid-stock-surge-sources-idUSKBN29Y03C), which would be the mother of short squeeze killers.

**The insider conundrum:** What might seem bizarre and bullish is that based on the SEC filings to date, the largest insiders have NOT exited their positions yet, unlike insiders at Koss who were happy to unload their entire portfolio. Unfortunately, altruism and optimism are almost certainly not the explanation as share prices are still far above what they would've rationally expected for years to come. These insiders are bound by both SEC laws and their fiduciary duty - they can't say no to raising more capital if it's in the best interest of the company... but the SEC won't allow them dump their shares if they're on the verge of diluting them. They're mulling over the capital raise carefully, because doing so would also reduce the value of their stake unless they can put the cash to work in a value accretive way. They're left with two options:

1. Issue more shares and see if they can effectively take advantage of the cash in a way that overcomes dilution (e.g., buyback, content plays)
2. Keep the prices inflated and wait until enough time has passed for their lawyers to clear them and dump on retail

**The imploding landmine:** Both of these moves would kill both the value of the shares and the potential for a short squeeze simultaneously, and ensure share prices go back to normalized values at $2-$4 depending on the level of optimism for AMC's future

**The play:** Puts on AMC were prohibitively expensive due to IV since last week, but IV has been creeping down drastically as the price flattens. If AMC prices remain stable through Monday - put spreads post earnings should be the way to go, conservative with buying a 6P and selling a 3P

tl:dr: AMC is disguised as a a cheaper version of GME, but it's a pump and dump scheme where the winners aren't who you think they are

Edit: Getting a lot of PMs... to be clear this isn't an endorsement for/against GME. But one of these two companies has issued more shares during the mania and has told you they're debating whether to do it again, and that creates a more interesting investment thesis than betting on reddit psychology for the next month.

SQQQ is better for short-term bets against QQQ using common stock (I think shorting TQQQ is a better option though). As far as what to use as a hedge QQQ would be appropriate if you are tech heavy in your stock holdings, but probably not the best choice if you are holding DJIA components (or sympathy plays) or small caps. Puts on IWM or DIA would be better in those situations. Alternatively you could just buy puts on your largest holdings or even sell covered calls and not worry about trying to make

SIULUNG once said that 2022 is the cycle of US stocks falling every seven years, starting from 1966 and falling every seven years thereafter, including 1973 when the world suffered the ""first oil crisis"", 1980 when inflation caused the stock market to plunge, 1987 when the US stock market crashed, 1994 when the US interest rate hike caused the bond massacre, 2001 when the 9/11 incident caused the US stocks to plunge, and seven years later The financial tsunami in 2008, and the fall in Hong Kong A-shares in 2015, while US stocks also retreated by about 3,000 points. Believe it or not, US stocks also fell sharply as SIULUNG said.

Many people have asked why there is no March 2020. According to the Austrian economist Peter Schumpeter, there are three different types of cycles in the economy: long, medium and short. The short cycle is about 40 months, the three short cycles form a medium cycle and the 18 short cycles form a long cycle. The cycle affecting 2022 is the seven-year cycle, while the cycles affecting 2020 are the 30-year and 60-year cycles.

Chart: Different cycles affect stock market movements

So are US stocks done falling yet? 

Bruce has many predictions for the future, as he mentioned earlier: ""According to current market estimates, the most common forecast is for the US to raise interest rates four times in 2022, but Bruce strongly believes that there may be more than four times, and that the pace of tapering will exceed expectations. ""Will interest rate hikes alone bring down the stock and property markets? We can't rule out the possibility that something like the first oil crisis will suddenly happen and push up inflation in the US, forcing the Fed to raise interest rates faster than everyone expects.

""According to the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture, Ukraine is the world's second largest exporter of barley, fourth largest exporter of corn and fifth largest exporter of wheat in the 2019-2020 market year. If the crisis does worsen, will energy and food prices rise sharply? And how will the Federal Reserve react? As SIULUNG said, if the US Fed misjudges inflation, will the US raise interest rates as it did in the 1970s?

stock market crash,options,Strategies for Hedging a Market Crash,"Hi all,

I trade exclusively in iron condors because I like that they're

1) defined risk and

2) delta neutral.

For each IC I trade I ensure that the max loss of the trade is max 5% of my net liq and I never allocate more than 50% of my net liq.

Although I'm diversified across underlyings, if a market crash were to occur, I imagine most if not all of my ICs would blow past the short put spread leg of each IC and I'd be left with half of what I started with.

Given this, what are some good long-term strategies to hedge a market crash?  Do you add far OTM debit put spreads in the same underlying?  Do you long volatility via VXX or long an inverse index like SH for SPY?  What's the prevailing wisdom here?

Bonus thought/question, I'm also wondering if I should start diversifying my strategies to not only be ICs.  What would you recommend for non-IC strategies that are defined risk and delta neutral?

Thanks.",377,"You want to have your cake and eat it. You can't be delta neutral, collect premium and hedge against a crash. Either you lose market neutrality or lose some of your premium.

The simplest thing to do is to take on less risk with your ICs and eventually diversify with large cap defensive stocks.",What about actual shares of a stock with a negative beta?,"I do a couple of things to hedge.

The first one is to try to take the opposite view within the same trade so it's more neutral. Iron condors are okay, but I like the jade lizard for this. 

The second is to try to take the opposite view overall within the portfolio. Since I mostly trade SPY, and SPY and QQQ are pretty correlated, I do some PMCCs in SQQQ, which goes up when QQQ goes down. A PMCC allows me to bleed a little most of the time, but then when QQQ goes down sharply I gain in the PMCC, so my account stays relatively flat.

Third, I really like broken wing butterflies. Once you put in the order it takes a long time to get filled, but I get a credit with them and if the market does drop there's that lottery ticket chance of a bigger win. Sometimes I do these in SPY in addition to my short put spreads."
stock market crash,options,Best way to bet on a market crash/correction?,"Is there a decent way to bet against the market via options? I'm looking at LEAPs, or far out expiration dates. But for PUTS, not calls.   


Without getting into an argument of, ""Bro, you can't time the market and this is a dumb ass idea"", let's **just assume I'm fine with losing money**. Under that assumption, I want to understand a way to buy long-term SPY or QQQ puts, as my thesis is the market will go down by say, June 2022.  


I was checking out the volume and price of SPY $350 puts for next year, for example, and I noticed 2 things:   


1. There is little to no volume on near anything after January 2022
2. The PUT options are still priced relatively high -- like $10.00 for a June 2022 $350 put. And there is no volume (at least today)

&#x200B;

If SPY falls to $300 by June 2022, the intrinsic value of my put would be $50 -- thus, at least a 5X return.   


But this all just seems... like it's not the best way to bet against the market.   


I have way too much experience with options (started in 2013 on earnings plays, then got into dumb SPY dailies, then more and more), but I'm not sure how to go about this particular thesis.  


NOTE: I am an idiot, and again, I don't want to argue if this is a good idea or not. Yes, I might as well light my cash on fire instead. Yes, I can't time the market. No, I won't send you money instead lol",10,"I 10-bagged SPY LEAPS calls after the crash.

stock market crash,options,[Gann Theory]There be any cycle in the stock market? US market crash every 7 years?,"Absolutely, the answer is yes, but we can't apply a simple and fixed model to all stock markets. Each stock market is an independent viberation with its own cycle and development laws. Therefore, the cycle and law of the stock market will be introduced before presenting the text of this book.

Since the 1900's, economists in western countries have engaged in the study the law of the cycle, and all believed that there was a long-term law in the economic growth or recession. There is noting new thing under the sun.

In 1930, the American economist S. Kuznets proposed a business cycle applying to housing construction, with an average length of 20 years. This long-term cycle is known as the ""Kuznets"" cycle, or building cycle. C Juglar, a French economist, published his Business Crisis and Cycle in France, Britain and the United States in 1862. In this book, he pointed out that the capitalist economy fluctuated every nine to ten years, as generally called ""Juglar cycle"". Joseph Schumpeter took this as the ""medium-term cycle"", or the ""Juglar cycle"".

Edward R. Deway, known as the father of cycle analysis, believed that the most statistically reliable cycles were 9.2 years and 3.83 years. He was also the founder of many institutions studying the cycles. Edward R. Dewey (1895-1978) dedicated his life to study the cycles (not limited to the business cycle) and in 1931, he was appointed as the Chief Economic Analyst by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Trying to find the cause of the Great Depression in 1929 and 1930 in the United States, Edward R. Dewey established the Foundation for the Study of Cycles in Pittsburgh in 1940. The following are some graphs about the cycles proposed by Edward.

Business cycles can be categorized into long-term, medium-term and short-term ones. You may ask, is there any business cycle in the stock market or the economy? Let's begin with the stock market cycle and then we will talk about the real estate cycle.

The 30-year cycle is one of the cores of Gann's cycle theory. When making a prediction, the 30-year cycle can be divided in further, including the following different cycles.

• 30-year cycle

• 22.5-year cycle - (360 X6/8)

• 15-year cycle - (360X4/8)

• 10-year cycle - (360X1/3)

• 7.5-year cycle - (360X2/8)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8ie2h2rbi0d81.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0fff6dc28584c5b11364d757b76c6e4c0cd85d6

If this 30-year cycle is applied to calculate the stock market cycle, you will get an amazing discovery . For example, Hong Kong's stock market crash in 1987 followed with another one 7.5 years later, namely in 1994, because of the upsurge of red chip speculation by foreign investors in 1993 and the United States' increase of the interest rates for 7 successive times. 15 years later, around the year of 2002 and 2003, the stock market underwent a huge decline because of the outbreak of avian influenza. In 2009, namely 22.5 years after that, HSI hit the bottom as a consequence of the financial tsunami. When it came to 2017, exactly 30 years later, HSI witnessed a depreciation in 2018 after experiencing the bull market.

When the 30-year cycle is applied to Shanghai securities composite index, there will also come something incredible. As shown in the chart below, the first peak after the establishment of Shanghai Stock Exchange occurred in May 1992. Following Gann's 30-year cycle, another peak appeared in the half of 1999, exactly 7.5 years later. 15 years later, the year of 2007 witnessed the climax of the bull market. After 22.5 years, the year of 2014 marked the starting point of the bull market in 2015. It is thought that the year of 2022, 30 years later, will be another high or low point.

Just as the old chinese sayings go that ""both people and things undergo great changes in a decade"", ""gold may become worthless in a decade"" and ""we cannot predict what will happen in a decade and don't laugh at poor people wearing rags"". These sayings point out the essence of the 10-year cycle. Juglar proposed that there was a 9 to 10 years' cyclical fluctuation for the market economy in his book Business Crisis and Cycle in France, Britain and the United States in 1862. In Business Prophecies of the Future Ups and Downs in Prices, Samuel T Benner stated that the highest point of trade price followed a repeated 8-9-10-year pattern. The 10-year cycle also plays an important role in Gann Theory.

Shanghai Securities Composite Index with a Cycle of 120 Months

Take Shanghai securities composite index as an example. After reaching a low point of 998 in 2005, the high point of the bull market appeared in 2015, 120 months (ten years) later. After the low point of 1,664 in October 2008, another lowest point came in 2018, 121 months later.

Shanghai Securities Composite Index with a Cycle of 52 Weeks

The above chart shows that the Shanghai securities composite index also subjects itself to a 52-week cycle. In the weekly column chart of the Shanghai securities composite index, the time interval between the peak in October 2007 and the low point is 52 weeks. After that, there will be return in every 52 weeks, either the peak or the bottoming out of the market index.

Let's see the weekly column chart of the Shanghai securities composite index and take ""7"" weeks as a cycle. It is found that from the high point of 2015, there is a relative turn in a cycle of 7 weeks or its multiples, namely 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 and 70.

Is this a coincidence or an accident for the above change in the stock market?

Now, one question. Whether the movement in the stock market is driven by events or the high and low points at the previous time point (cycle)? Therefore, China's stock market proceeds in a cyclical way. The turning point can be predicted as long as the right starting point can be realized.

There is also a cycle for real estate. Although economists all over the world hold different opinions towards the research of the real estate market, but they serve the same effect. I will state the opinions of the following economists for your reference.

·Michael Hoyt, the author of One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago, studied the price of real estate in Chicago in a time period of 103 years since there were only dozens of wooden houses, and he found that its price cycles about every 18 years.

·Edward R. Deway, known as the father of cycle analysis, believed that each real estate cycle lasts for about 18 years.

·Fred Harrison, a British economist studying the real estate market in the Britain and United States in the past 200-plus years, found that the housing price cycled about every 18 years.

·Simon Smith Kuznets believed that the building cycle is 15 to 20 years.

It is coincidentally acknowledged that the real estate market cycles every 18 to 20 years. Starting from 1965, it is generally believed that the real estate market in Hong Kong has gone through three major cycles, the first cycle from 1965 to 1981; the second one from 1981 to 1997; and the third one from 1997 to now. The housing price often goes up or down along with the change of both internal and external elements.

I have mentioned the Hong Kong real estate market cycle in different situations. It is not difficult to draw a conclusion from the cycle of Hong Kong's real estate market that the cycle works every six years. Since 1997, great changes occur every six years, including 2003, 2009, 2015, and 2021. With Gann's 50% segmentation method, we can get that three years constitute a secondary cycle, namely in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018.

The change of the real estate market can also be concluded with the 18-year cycle, which has worked since 1985. Undoubtedly, the real estate market in Hong Kong goes up after experiencing the lowest point in 2003. Predicably, that the year of 2021 is likely to witness the completion of an 18-year cycle. Stepping back again, the rise of the real estate market in 2003 can be explained with the 6-year cycle mentioned above since the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1985.

It is likely that the upsurge of Hong Kong's real estate market will end in 2021, and then we should turn to the turning point that may appear from 2023 to 2024.

The economic cycle of U.S. stocks has a very obvious 7-year cycle.

\-In October 1987, the Dow fell 22% in one day on ""Black Monday"".

\-Seven years later, in 1994, the FED raised interest rates six times in a row, and interest rates rose sharply from 3% to 6%, resulting in the most famous bond massacre in history.

\-Seven years later, in 2001, the Black Swan event of 9/11 triggered a severe setback in the global stock market, and the U.S. declared an emergency stock market closure from 9/11 to 9/14, but the market resumed on the 17th, the U.S. stocks still had a panic sale, the S&P 500 index opened at 1,092 points and closed almost at the low of 1,038 points, down 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index was killed to 8,883 points, down 7%, and the stock market fell 14% in one week.

Lots of confirmation bias here shoehorning things into this ""7-year cycle"". Yes, most years something bad happens in stocks at some point. You seem to suggest that the 9/11 terrorist attack was predicted by this 7-year cycle? Do you think the hijackers wanted to do it in 2000 but held off until 2001 so it would fit this timeline?

If we're looking at exogenous events, how does the worst 30-day period for the S&P since the Great Depression fit into this narrative? No mention of COVID crash of March 2020? 

Why are you bringing the Hunt Brothers' silver squeeze into this? I thought we were talking about stocks? Couldn't find anything else that happened in 1980? Because the S&P 500 was up 26% in 1980 - I'll take that!

My new theory is that now all even years have significant pullbacks, so buy puts in even years.

stock market crash,options,I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ng4vmop1g5771.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec5b766b99d8ad4fdca8f55d229f087bf4c2d8b)

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. Identifying a crash itself is very hard

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6itqq273g5771.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec154f4892c6522d84357d7358fbeaa99c835b2)

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.   

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

options,options,The Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitability (The reasons selling option premium makes or loses money),"# Here's what makes option selling profitable (in detail) and how to increase your returns selling them.

This is a long post, it helps you understand options a bit better and make some profitable decisions in the future!

I try to make theta and options easier to understand by relating it to real estate and moving one step at a time.

If you have questions, leave a comment, I'll try to respond to everyone.

Let's dive into the world of Theta and options trading!!

# #1: Theta is a feature of an option. Plain and simple.

Imagine showing someone a house and saying to them *""It's 3 bedrooms, 2 washrooms, good neighbourhood, and the rent is $2,000/mo"".*

Each thing you listed in that sentence is a feature of the house. You wouldn't say that the house is good or bad because bedroom, or because rent, etc. It's the over all view with all things considered.

Similarly, theta, gamma, vega, delta, etc... these are just features of an option. Inherently, they are not good or bad. they just tell you about the option you are looking at.

# #2: Think of theta as rent.

If options were a house, theta would be the rent. Think about it like this. *Someone pays rent to get access to the house.*

In the options space: *someone pays theta for access to other features of the option.*

Can you guess what they are paying for access to?

# #3: One man's theta is another man's gamma.

If you guessed gamma, you are correct! T*raders pay theta to get access to gamma.*

The easy way to think about gamma is that it's your sensitivity to big moves. If a stock moves like crazy, the option buyer makes some bank, right? So why on earth would ANYONE sell options?

# #4: The amount of theta is directly correlated with the ""gamma risk"".

Going back to our house example, if you wanted to buy a big penthouse in downtown New York, the rent is probably pretty high. It's because you get access to some awesome shit if you pay it! It wouldn't make sense for the rent to be $500/mo. No one would rent it out! *The rent is correlated with the house you get exposure to*.

In the options space, if a stock has a lot of ""gamma risk"", AKA the risk of big move, the theta on the option is higher too! This is because if it were not proportionately higher, no one would be a seller, and there would be no market.

**Now heres the key.** If gamma and theta were perfectly even, and markets were totally efficient, the expected value would be 0 (you wouldn't make money being a buyer or seller). In this world, who wouldn't want break even exposure to big moves?? It's basically a free hedge!

SO.... there's this little thing called **variance risk premium**\*\*.\*\*

# #5 Option sellers get a small premium for being on the short side of convexity.

The variance risk premium is a small edge for the option seller that they get for holding the risk of big moves.

Because of this, on average, selling options is profitable. In the long run, you will have a lot of small winners and the occasional big loser. This is what we call a ""short vol"" strategy.

You can see the risk premium on a lot of stocks. An easy way to see it is to plot the Implied volatility for 30 day options over the realized volatility for 30 day period. You should see that on average the *implied move* (what the options SAY will happen), is a bit higher than what actually does. THIS IS THE PREMIUM!

and then you will see periods where the big gamma move happens, and the RV goes higher than the IV. THIS IS WHY THE PREMIUM EXISTS!

**Example**:

[Green Line = IV. Blue line = RV. this is on SPY. You can see how most of the time, IV \> RV, Sometimes the RV Shoots up though. That is the risk we take when selling \(why we get paid a premium\)](https://preview.redd.it/9ktklg38raq71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb85e3f21b0789904e9e3b6a5884ac1ffd79fba0)

&#x200B;

Green Line = IV. Blue line = RV. this is on SPY. You can see how most of the time, IV > RV, Sometimes the RV Shoots up though. That is the risk we take when selling (why we get paid a premium)

But here's the thing.. how much can we really expect to make here?

In the long run, about 11% per year. boo.

*I want more. You want more. Fuck 11% / year. So how do we do it?*

# #6 Buy Cheap Things, Sell Expensive Things.

Let's go back to our house example, 1 more time. Imagine we are evaluating a property in New York City. All of a sudden, a HUGE amount of demand comes into the market. There is a shortage of houses for all the renters, so the rent keeps increasing. You look at your property.. 2 beds, nice view.. fair rent is probably $4,000 /mo. But you look at the market and people are offering $6,000/mo for your property!!

In this case, by renting out your property, you are making an *Inflated premium*, or a rent premium higher than what you should be making given the asset you are giving someone access to.

In options, we can find stocks where the Theta is HIGHER than it should be, given the gamma we give someone exposure to!

Think about some of these meme stocks as example. So many buyers, so few sellers (who wants that risk, right?).

Well... this is perhaps opportunity!

If we can come into the market and put a fair value on the ""gamma"", we can find times where we can be *overcompensated with theta.*

There is a simple formula for understanding this.

IF IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS HIGHER THAN WHAT YOU THINK REALIZED VOLATILITY WILL BE: SELL!

Even more simply put: if option more expensive than how much stock move, sell!

The hard part is learning to price volatility / options (I'll cover the basics in another post if this one does well).

# #7 Here's an example of how I analyze/price gamma and theta.

Imagine we divided the IV by the RV, we would be able to see *how much* higher or lower the IV is compared to the RV.

example: if IV/RV = 1.5, then the price of the option is 1.5x higher than the value the buyer is actually getting (easy way to think about it).

By plotting the IV/RV Ratio historically, we can see how much of a premium their typically is, and how bad it gets when the gamma move is big!

**Example**:

[typically the iv\/rv ratio for 30 dte options is positive on SPY. but we do have periods of pain where it goes lower and that erases a lot of gains.](https://preview.redd.it/37bkr2k6raq71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=546f54ba35cffb38cf298ce1789ae4975ba67ccc)

typically the iv/rv ratio for 30 dte options is positive on SPY. but we do have periods of pain where it goes lower and that erases a lot of gains.

# CONCLUSION:

Theta is not free money. It's a characteristic of an option. Understanding it is important, but really, it's our ability to price risk that makes us money as traders. The better we get at pricing risk, the truly ""juicier"" premiums we can find.

If this post is well received by the community, I'll gladly do a follow up.

Happy trading everyone!",1612,"~~Theta is not free money~~ Theta is free\* money

options,options,Evidence pointing to shorts did not cover pretended they did (via options) to break the squeeze (Feedback requested),"I know you guys are probably sick of hearing GME related stuff but I really wanted to post this here to get some additional thoughts/feedback from experienced investors.

Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing.

TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version below.

There’s an insightful piece on [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

First way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

Quoting from Tradesmithdaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

However the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

To now quote verbatim from Tradesmithdaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast.

But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

*“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*”

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”, which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions that they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

Separately but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated 113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 122% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice.

For a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

\*\*

Excerpt:

The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.

Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)

S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.

it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)

So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.

Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade ""longs whose shares were borrowed away to short"") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22

That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.

\*\*

Many have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3’s part. It’s interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn't moved much at all ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)). Initially on the 28th he claimed short interest float to be $122 ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322)). The next day he claimed short interest to be 113% ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755)) of float. 2 days later on Sunday, S3 released a report on the calculated short interest to be 55% (oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted, but found this [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897)), which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of 55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I cannot conclusively say as I don’t have the evidence to conclusively make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all other data points.

With the possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\_gme\_can\_still\_be\_a\_great\_play/gm2tsnw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity

This is the kind of calm and rational thinking that we should all pay attention to. Seeing the new short % on the 9th will be interesting,"Unfortunately, the SEC is made up of not only a barely scraping by budget, but also some former wallstreet players, like Goldman Sachs exec Alan Cohen hired as senior policy advisor to the SEC chairman in 2017. I can't imagine they would hire people without experience in the field they are supposed to regulate. Its also odd how so many of these SEC memos coming to light describe the exact actions and circumstances that have been happening for years, which makes me think some or all of them are written from personal experience.

Much like the Jim Cramer interview from mid 2000s on The Street.tv (found on youtube), they spell out what can be done regardless of ""legality""; the only law it seems is how much money does a certain action cost to do.

Edit V1. So my portfolio was liquidated on Monday. They cashed everything out. I had six figure portfolio in there. That's pretty much all my savings. I don't have any more money to give.


I was reading that people weren't getting exercised and so it's just total bad luck that ALL my contracts got exercised? My thinking was the float is 58mil. But with the number of contracts that were sold how did they get so much stock? It feels like a GME where the short side is 3x greater than the actual float

options,options,Does anyone make consistent profit buying options?,"I've been doing a lot of research into different options strategies the past few years and one thing I've taken from it is that the people who make consistent profits are the ones who sell contracts instead of buying them. You might get the occasional WSB-type who hits it big on some random meme stock but those gains are usually fleeting. So I'm curious, does anyone here make consistent profit or know someone who does by buying contracts?

The closest thing I can think of is this Youtube channel I used to listen to a while back that made crazy profit buying OTM leaps on tech and growth ETFs. There were a bunch of people following that method but it obviously blew up in their faces last year. Now the channel's rebranded to talking about fundamentals investing.",128,"I know a couple people in my personal life who make a living off options, but the common theme I’ve heard from them is this: 

You have to have a really well-defined strategy that you stick to consistently (while simultaneously recognizing that strategy may become obsolete and you’re going to need to retool / evolve), have really strong discipline / risk management, and be even-keeled and not let wins or losses affect your judgment—all while having a balance large enough to both enable you to trade on margin and sustain loss streaks without hampering your ability to trade. 

It’s already hard enough to have one of these traits, but having all of them is incredibly difficult. I’ve been told only one in 25-30 people who actually seriously invest themselves into day trading are able to make consistent money, and even fewer are going to be making that much more than a regular job, at which point why take the risk and have no benefits / pension etc.

The people I know make like 500k+ annually, but all of them are really smart, experienced, and had great guidance on their journey. Unless that’s you, I would take great caution","A decent number of people make money buying LEAPS... deep in the money options long dated out.  They're expensive, but they tend to have high deltas and because they're deep ITM, they tend to stay ITM. A lot of those people will sell short dated calls against them as well tho, it's called a 'Poor Man's Covered Call"", PMCC.  But even if you don't sell the calls, the LEAPS themselves will do pretty good if the underlying goes up.  

The other thing people do is buy long options or spreads with a directional bias, at the money.  If you're buying a contract, buy it with the strike price at or near the current, if you're buying a long vertical spread, buy it where the midpoint is at or near the current price.  

What you don't want to do is buy OTM contracts.  The reason they're cheap is because they're unlikely to get profitable, and then theta decay is really working against you.  Those are lottery tickets.  Cheap, good payoff... but statistically unlikely.

The mods and the community have put together, in one way or another, a comprehensive list of [materials](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/index) which you should take advantage of. It's a good place to start if you're completely new to this.

You don't need to fully comprehend all the material but it's way better than blindly going into a trade or handicapping yourselves unintentionally.

I'm often reminded of myself in my earlier years when I see others enter a position and then look for help when it turns unfavourably against them (nothing inherently wrong with doing so), hence I felt like I had to mention it and continue to help and guide others who are new.

Also do consider trying out paper trading accounts before actually putting in your hard earned money. I personally use TD's ThinkOrSwim platform since it's interface is best suited for my needs but the idea is the same regardless of platform. You can try out the various strategies outlined in this sub or even do some YOLO trades to see what works for you.

All of RH orders are satisfied by Citadel. Citadel connects to the exchanges, but RH customers never do. Citadel leant Melvin 2B to pay margin for 400 days @ $300 price. If GME jumps to $1200 that is cut to 100 days. This is why the freedom of supply and demand has been cut to 1 share for gamestop. Citadel can’t let the price rise or Melvin will run out of funds to pay margin too soon. RH has to bow to Citadel’s every whim because they have no connection to any actual exchange. The market is not free.

market,options,My SPX Weekly Premium Selling That Dominates the Market,"\-----------------------

EDIT - May 23, 2022

It has been a LONG time since I first posted this, but I still have people who pop in on occasion, read it, ask questions, etc. I have changed my strategy/parameters quite a bit since posting this. Namely, moved from spreads to naked, added calls, and added profit targets for a pure mechanical play. I'm going to leave everything below in its original state so that it lines up with any comments/discussion. For the current parameters that I'm running, you can reference my website.

\-----------------------

&#x200B;

I've been trading stocks for \~15 years and options for \~10. I have a full-time job and just do this on the side, but I've seen and tried a lot of stuff.

One of my favorite trading strategies involves selling SPX put credit spreads around 9-10 delta (2-5% OTM), 2 days to expiration. Crazy, right? Yeah, sounds like it. But bear with me while I lay out the nitty-gritty. I like the strategy so much that I've decided to (finally) lay it out in full detail for others to learn.

My inspiration for this started after reading and following Karsten's ""Passive income through option writing"" from [EarlyRetirementNow.com](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/09/28/passive-income-through-option-writing-part1/). He lays out his reasoning and thought process way better than I ever could, so if you like what you see here, go check out his stuff as well for more research and a twist on what I'm doing.

**What I Do**

Every Monday, Wednesday, & Friday, I sell (open) new put credit spreads on SPX that expire at the closest expiration. So, Monday, I sell SPX spreads that expire Wednesday. Wednesday, I sell spreads that expire Friday. Friday, I sell spreads that expire Monday. I hold these all the way to expiration and then open a new position with the next expiration. 95% of the time, these expire worthless and I collect full premium. The other 5% of the time, I suffer a small or large loss. Over the long run, the expected return blows the market out of the water....which leads me to:

**Expected Return**

I've been running this since May 2019 and am averaging something around **150% APY** based on max risk for the spread. It's absurd. Don't believe me? My full trade log is published [here](https://wealthyoption.com/trades), and I update it in real-time. (Yes, that's my website. No, I'm not selling any kind of product/service there. More on that later)

**Risk & Drawdown**

This massive positive return doesn't come without a cost, of course. And if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. And the cost here is that, yeah, while annual return is a ridiculous 150%, max drawdown can be 100% or more. ***Whaaaaat?!*** Yeah, that's right. While these spreads expire worthless 95% of the time, the other 5% can result in huge losses. These losses can accumulate up to 100% or more depending on the environment.

So this is a guaranteed way to blow up your account, right? Well, it is if you allocate too much capital to it. But if you keep your allocation small (which I do), then a 100%+ drawdown for this one strategy will be a small fraction of your overall portfolio. I personally only allocate about 10% of my total portfolio to this. What that means is that if/when this trading plan suffers a 100% loss, that only represents 10% drawdown for my portfolio, and I can tap into my other investments to ""replenish"" this trading plan.

These massive losses do happen, but they don't last long. I ran this very strategy through COVID-19 when VIX moved from 13 to 85 in a month, and my max drawdown was ""only"" about 125%. I reloaded from my other investments, and this put selling strategy recovered and turned green in 2020 before the market itself did...after I went down 125%.

**Pennies, Meet Steamroller, Right?**

Yeah, this is pretty close to the definition of picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. There's nothing inherently wrong with that IF:

1. The pennies that you collect add up to more than what the steamroller takes away
2. You limit allocation so that when the steamroller hits you, it doesn't destroy you

\#1 - I collect around 2.3% premium per position compared to max risk (spread width). 95% of the time, they expire worthless, so I keep the full 2.3%. The other 5% of the time, I suffer what is usually a large loss, averaging around 20%. Do the math here: 95 \* 2.3 is 220% gain on the wins. 5 \* 20% is 100% loss on the losers. 220% - 100% makes for a very positive expected return...So that takes care of #1. The pennies I collect far outweigh the steamroller when it hits me.

\#2 - I only allocate 10% of my overall portfolio to this. When the steamroller hits me and results in a 100% loss for the strategy, I'm not wiped out. That's only 10% drawdown on my account, which is easy to recover from. This is what so many people miss when talking about the ole steamroller. If you just keep allocation in check, it's *okay* to get hit by a steamroller every now and then.

**Trade Process - Timing & Strike Selection**

The process here is simple. Every M/W/F afternoon, open a new set of put spreads expiring at the next expiration. Monday's position expires Wednesday. Wednesday's position expires Friday. Friday's position expires Monday. My short strike is around 9-10 delta. My long strike is 100-150 points below that. This results in a short strike around 2% OTM in low IV environments and 5% OTM in high IV environments. The long strike will be 5-10% OTM, again depending on IV. It'll be farther out as VIX rises.

You only suffer max loss if the S&P500 drops 5% in a day or two out of absolutely nowhere (VIX < 15), or if S&P500 drops 10% in a day or two ***after*** freefall has already started. In 18 months, and with VIX rocketing to 85 during that timeframe, not once has one of my spreads even seen max loss....I'm sure it'll happen at some point, but if didn't happen in 2020, I'm curious to see when it would happen.

**Why SPX**

* 3 expirations available every week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday)
* Highly liquid
* Cash-settled. No underlying given to me on assignment.
* Low trading fees (for me personally - your mileage may vary)
* Beneficial tax treatment (60/40% long-term based on IRS 1256 contract straddles)
* Less ""paperwork"" to file for taxes. Futures and index options aggregate together on IRS tax forms, eliminating 200 line items from this trading strategy in a year

SPX is awesome.

**Alternatives to SPX**

Some of you may not have access to SPX options. Or your account isn't large enough to be handle SPX options. They are huge. A single contract represents $300k notional. The cash-settlement and risk-defined trades help diminish the impact of size, but it's still a lot of underlying to carry around. /ES (futures) are half the size and should work as well (just be sure you understand fees, assignment, and liquidity first). SPY can also work and is even smaller than /ES. Again, understand assignment of shares and fees. You also lose the tax benefit with SPY. But on smaller accounts, this may be the only viable option.

Doesn't that mean you have to be right 35 times to make up for one loss?  Or do you cut your losses when it stops going your way?  Or has it never reached your bottom strike so you never have a total loss of the 15k?","Hi! I'm Karsten, aka Big Ern, mentioned as one of the pioneers of this strategy, running this since 2011. Congrats on the successful implementation of this strategy. This is a bit different from my own strategy, where I sell naked puts but far OTM, usually with a 3-5 Delta instead of your 10-Delta strikes.

Also, in case people wonder how and why your strategy has such impressive return estimates, much higher than mine: You calculate your returns as a % of your Value-at-Risk. I calculate my returns as % of the total portfolio. So, my % losses and gains are a lot smaller because they are divided by a larger denominator.

Also, one piece of advice: Don't get too confident that you made it through 2020. This year was surprisingly kind to us vol sellers (see [https://earlyretirementnow.com/2020/06/10/passive-income-through-option-writing-part-4/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2020/06/10/passive-income-through-option-writing-part-4/)

). August 2015 and February 2018 could have been far worse, even though the market didn't drop as much as in 2020. As a general guideline, I'd budget keeping about 40% of the premium (=>60% set aside for losses). I've had much higher premium capture than that (90+% in 2019, about 60% on average) but 40% is a nice conservative estimate in the years when things don't work so well (2015, 2018)."

Have some time this weekend and have a real time opportunity and would love some education.  

**Backstory** 

$EOSE just closed at 2.71. Eos Energy is manufactures non lithium commercial batteries, think shipping container sized batteries for grid stablization / C&I applications. It's priced for bankruptcy with enough cash for a couple months tops. However they have been in process for a Dept of Energy loan for over 2 years now. Eos has guided the loan size to $250m+ and could recieve a commitment in 30-45 days. Current Market Cap is only $320m. The loan is for automated manufacturing of their new Z3 batteries, good specs and tech. If they get loan + execute on current contracted backlog order / sales funnel, Eos guided to FCF positive mid 2024. I belive this stock trades between $5-$8 upon loan approval. Happy to share more DD if interested. I'm maily invested with shares but looking to understand the call options on this.

**Question**

EOSE: $2.71

Jan 2024 Call Options,DTE 224, Let pick the $5 strike. 

Price $0.60, IV 126.36%, Gamma .1422, Vega .0085, Theta -.0023, ITM% 13.45%, 

**I calculated a 1 standard deviation move being +/-$2.68. Lets say it is trading at $8 in 30 days bc of loan approval news. That's a 2 SD move +/- $5.37 + $2.71 current share price = $8.07.

Thanks in advance for anyone taking the time to bestow some knowledge to me. 

&#x200B;",3,"You are close but IV measures the st dev of log(returns) not prices.  IV is a relic that comes from the generic option pricing model which assumes normally distributed log(returns).  You can't have a price go below zero with log(returns).

The correct price calculation for a 1 s.d. move up over 224 days is 2.71 \* exp(1.26 \* sqrt(224/365))  = 7.29

and price down is 2.71 \* exp(-1.26 \* sqrt(224/365))  = 1.01

Also you should be using 30 days not 224 days in the calculation since you are trying to measure a 30 day move. 

FYI:  When interest rates started trading at negative values, interest rate option traders had to change from log(return) models to price based models which would permit negative prices.","Yes, 2.71 * 1.26 * sqroot 224/365 = 2.68",How are you calculating a “standard deviation move”?

share price,options,Dividend effects on the share price,"So MSFT has a cash dividend on 3/11 (today) of .56 for shareholders which have been holding since 2/18.  As far as I understand, this means the stock would be expected to go down by .56 because it is effectively worth that much more when you know about it.  What I'm a bit confused about is when.  Since it was announced on 12/2/2020, does that mean the share price would go up .56 on 12/2?  Further, I'm unclear whether the dip back down is supposed to happen on 2/18, today (3/11), or tomorrow (3/12).  If today is the date of the dividend, does that mean as long as you hold to 4pm you get it, and therefore in after hours today it would go down by .56?

share price,options,Findings best position based on predictions of share price,I believe $TSLA will trade at or below $50 sometime before January 2024. How do I go about finding the put options that will give maximum payout?,1,"It depends on your confidence level for the price range and the timing. Also the shape of the price history leading up to the time. Are you expecting the price to go up or sideways and then suddenly tank? Or gradually drift lower?

The high-level approach is that the more you can narrow down the uncertainty and the more dramatic the price change, the more surgical you can be in entry/exit. The less certain you are or the more wishy-washy the move, the larger the net you have to cast.

For example, if you think TSLA will gradually rise and then suddenly tank 30% in October of 2023, wait until September to buy a November monthly put. On the other hand, if you have no clue what TSLA will do before the move and have no clue when the move might happen short of sometime in the next 12 months, spread your bets by rolling 60 DTE puts every 30 days.

I'm not a fan of casting a wide net with single entries and far expirations. Those cost too much up front and you have nothing but theta decay while you wait. Rolling 60 DTE every 30 days lets you adjust to market conditions once a month, manages theta decay, and keeps  you on the most liquid monthly expirations. And obviously, if the trend before the event is gradually down, you'll be able to take profit off the table earlier, albeit at smaller chunks at a time.

I know share price isn't the only determinant in the value of an option but keeping everything in mind that still seems very odd. Can someone explain what might be going on?",2,"You have met up with a fundamental fact of options. Here is my nearly daily remark upon this fact. There are other facts like this waiting to bite you.  

This experience is a common experience during the present market phase, with higher volatility than in the past, and essential to understanding how options work.  It is especially important if you buy options out of the money, and at the money. 
  
An option's relationship with the underlying stock's price is not linear. 
You can lose nearly the entire value of your option in one day, even though the underlying stock's spot price does not change, and the option has not yet expired. 

There are two components to every option price.  
The **Intrinsic value**, and the **Extrinsic value**. 

The **intrinsic value**, is the immediate inherent value of the option, as it relates to the stock's current price.  
If the option owner exercises a long debit option they own immediately, this is the useful value to the option owner upon exercise of the option.   
 
- For a debit long call intrinsic value is the market price of the underlying stock, minus the option strike price. If this number is negative, the intrinsic value is ZERO.  
- For a debit long put, intrinsic value is the option strike price, minus the market price of the underlying. If this number is negative, the intrinsic value is ZERO.

The **extrinsic value** is the remaining value of an option's market price4 and can be 100% of the option's value:  an out of the money option has 100% extrinsic value (and zero intrinsic value).  It can be quite volatile.  The extrinsic value is influenced by interest rates (the time value of money), market expectations and market anxiety (extrinsic value rises and falls, in part, on on demand for portfolio protection in the marketplace).   

- Theta decay is the term for time decay of extrinsic value.

&nbsp;

**Examples:**  

- If you buy an option on XYZ company for $3.50, at strike price of 10.00, and also XYZ, the stock, has a spot price of $11.00, then the intrinsic value of the option is $1.00 (market: 11.00 minus option strike price 10.00 = 1.00), and the extrinsic value is $2.50.

-  If the XYZ stock goes up to, for example, to $12.00, and also market expectations evaporate that the stock might go to $14.00 in the period before the option expires, the option could have a market value of $ 2.50.  (Intrinsic value: 2.00, extrinsic value .50).  The owner of the option in this case has lost a $1.00 in the option's value (compared to what they paid), even though the XYZ stock went up $1.00.  **This kind of thing happens all of the time, and it is why options are hard.**

",Vix dropped 2.5% could be the reason. ,"Depending on brokerage, the last trade price may give you an inaccurate impression of your option value, particularly in cases like this where the liquidity is terrible.  Look at the bid/ask as I'm seeing an increase in value.  You are also long vega, but anytime I see these questions it's almost always a liquidity/UI issue."
share price,options,"Selling covered calls, strike price lower then share price ?","Is it wise to sell covered calls for a strike price under your share price. 

I have 2000 shares of CRNT, currently the stocks at $4, I got CRNT for $5.60 per share. Can I sell covered calls for $5 strike price if I believe it won’t hit $5 before expire. Just to collect premium?",10,"That’s like, the entire point of covered calls

Why sell shares when you could sell people the dream of being able to buy shares?",Absolutely.,"Here are some things to consider: 

If you want to keep the stock forever the thing to do is sell the calls at the strike price that the stock is at now. In your case $4 . This is the point where the calls have the maximum premium that you are selling to someone else. Look up the Black-Scholes model if you don't already know this.

Forget trying to make up for stock you (think) you paid to much for. The market has no memory of any past price. It only knows what someone is willing to pay for it right now and what someone is willing to sell it for right now. Price is actually irrelevant.  All that matters is premium (also known as 'the juice' ).

If the stock rises - say to $5 - as the expiration date approaches the premium in your sold contract decays away but there is new juice in the $5 strike price in the next expiration down the road. You use a technique called 'rolling forward' to capture more profits by selling more juice.

If the stock falls below $4 when expiration comes you can let the option expire. Then sell the next at the money call to capture more juice (profits).

You can also 'roll down' to take more money out of the market . That is the name of the game isn't it? To take money out of the market, not put money in.

If these concepts seem hard to grasp I recommended the book ""Trading in the Zone"" by Mark Douglas (RIP) many of his seminars are on YouTube and they are excellent.

share price,options,Option assignment accounting methods. Premium/ Share price - IBKR/Australia,"Hi all,  had a quick question, in case of an option assignment how do you treat the premium received for accounting purposes?   
Lets say I was assigned 100  shares at 200 SP and my short put contract was closed out. Now this  contract was sold at a premium of 15$ which was realized on assignment.   
This can be treated in 2 ways :   
a)  In this case my net cost would 200-15 = 185$ per share and further any trades to this being treated as a Capital event. But what happens to the premium, will that be included in the realized P&L for option trades or will now be excluded?  
   
b) Or the other way being Share price treated as 200 for all buy/sell events thereon and CG calculated accordingly.  
And the premium realized on assignment is simply added to options as a realized trade and treated like the rest of the contracts? In this case this will be treated as $15 premium as realized profit as this can be treated as option expiring worthless.  


This is getting little confusing as was assigned a couple of times and now trying to work out how to account this for accounting/taxation purposes.

Just wait for the highest probability setup on your technicals and trade in-line with the Daily chart and market sentiment using the 1hr chart to dial in your entry/exit. Let the trade play out. Just because it dips a bit after going in your direction doesn't mean it is entering a trend reversal. Shoot for at least a 1:3 risk/reward. You might be in that trade 2-3 days or longer. Don't paper hand. And, unless there is a bonafide high probability setup on a Thursday don't buy options expiring the next day. Rather, buy the following weeks Expiration.

options trading,options,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

[https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU](https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU) 

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

options trading,options,3 Step Process To Options Trading,"I have been trading options for over 30 years and I am frequently asked, ""Where Can I Learn To Trade Options?"" Here is my 3 step process. Most of you are already mastering the first two steps and if you are proficient at those, the options part is pretty easy.

All of your trading has to start with market analysis. That means getting your bearings from a technical perspective (moving averages, volume, trendlines, momentum) and also be aware of the fundamental backdrop (earnings, interest rates, economic data, political policies). I spend 3 hours each morning conducting market analysis. This is the most critical step and it is the biggest piece of the puzzle. More than 75% of all stocks follow the market. If you get this wrong there is a 75% likelihood you will lose money. I always have a 5 minute chart of the SPY up when I am trading and I never take my eye off of it. Once you have your market bearings, you are ready for the next step.

Let's say that you have concluded that the market is bullish for the next few days and that the uptrend should continue. There are not any speedbumps (economic events) ahead and the downside risk is minimal. Now it is time to zero in on the best stock.

I look for stocks that are moving higher when the market is moving lower. I call this relative strength (RS). Do NOT confuse this with the RSI indicator that compares the stock's current move to its recent price movement (I find little value in RSI). Find stocks with relative strength that are moving higher on heavy volume and that have broken through technical resistance. These will be your best prospects.

If you get the market right and the stock right, options are easy. They are simply a way for you to increase your leverage. Here's the rub. I am not saying that getting the first two steps is easy. It is very difficult and until you hone your skills with steps one and steps two you should not trade options. You will simply lose your money faster.

Basic options buying strategies and vertical spreads are all you need to trade any market scenario. Your opinion of the market and your confidence in that forecast determine the best options trading strategy along with your opinion of the magnitude and the duration of the expected stock move. Keep your strategies basic and the positions will be much easier to manage.

Options are not the starting point, they are the icing on the cake. Market first, stock second and options last.

I went through the entire process and it culminated with a trade example. Here is a link to Part 2

Thanks in advance!",58,"Every gimme has a gotcha. 


You can try to learn about the Greeks and how they work.   But at the end of the day the options Greeks come out of the options price… they don’t determine the options price, the market (buyers and sellers) is what ultimately determines the price…. Black scholes is just a model that describes how the price of options should be based on normal distribution…..  remember it’s just a fancy model that is used to help describe the physics of how an options price moves… the mode is a good predictor but it isn’t the rule of law. 



if you’re going to go down the path of Greeks, learn Delta, theta, gamma, and vega…. There are more Greeks but those 4 will cover what you need to know…. 


Delta - you can think of this as the chance that the stock will end at that price. It’s also the amount the  options value will move based on a 1$ move in the stock…. So say you buy a 110 call on a stock that’s 90$ and it has a 20 delta… and the stock moves to 91$, expect yourself to gain 20 cents not 1$ on your call option.   Note: closer to expiration, the delta starts to collapse, meaning a 20 delta is a lot closer to the stock price at 0DTE than at 45 dte. 

Gamma- it’s a derivative on delta, it says how much delta changes with a 1$ move in the stock… so did the example above of the delta was 20 and the gamma was 2 then a 1$ move would make the delta now change to 22.   Note: closer to expiration gamma starts to grow exponentially

Theta: this is the time component of options. The options will theoretically lose theta amount of value every day.    As you get closer to expiration the theta on options starts to grow exponentially. 

Vega:   Kinda hard to explain this one but it’s essentially how the options price changes according to the volatility of the market (for the stock)   If Vega is high (you’d have to look at iv rank or iv percentile to get a better picture of this) then the options price will be high…. Think GME or AMC when they were mooning, the options Vega would explode so the options prices would skyrocket. 





Now all that knowledge isn’t going to help you trade. My advice is sell puts on something like SLV maybe 25 delta, something like 45 days out and then  close the position at 21 days. Rinse and repeat….   Do that for a year and since slv is relatively safe you won’t lose money, but you’ll learn how options prices get impacted by price movements or by time…. If slv is too slow for you pick a stock that’s under 30$/share but more than 15$/share and do the same thing.","*I’m not really interested in someone starting with $15-20k or more making money but the guys/gals with small accounts....*

$20k IS a small account in options terms.

 
*I've seen a lot of “I used to trade stocks and now I make hundreds of thousands with options” I understand half that is guys marketing their courses.*

No guy that makes hundreds of thousands produces YT videos promoting his strategy for $xyz/month.



*I don’t expect myself to make millions but just want some realistic expectations*

You WONT make millions. 

Newbies are sadly sold this dream by YT marketeers that options is a gateway to fast and easy riches. Dont believe the nonsense you see like ""I made $4,000 in two hours! Now I want to teach YOU how to do it.""
Think of options trading like doing an engineering degree for 4 years. At the end, you are not an engineer, but you have the basics of becoming one. Then it takes another 5 years of real world application before you become an engineer. Same with options.

**It consists of two sheets:**

1. **Tracker:** A watchlist to track stocks and automatically pull financial ratios and data.
2. **Fundamental Analysis:** A way to automatically pull financial statement data, ratios and metrics for analysis.

Everything is **automated**, the only things you have to change are the **tickers** and **data points** you want to pull.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Open it, go to File and click Make a Copy**
2. **Follow all of the instructions on the ""Guide"" tab**

**Use the sheet in this way:**

1. Add new tickers to column A of staticData
2. Sort column A of staticData by A-Z after adding new tickers
3. Add the ticker you want to analyze to A1 of fundamentalAnalysis

stock market prices,options,Can rich people dump money into a stock to manipulate options prices?,"I just had an idea. Suppose that you're a rich person, with at least $1 billion dollars on hand to exist. Maybe not all your money, but in an investment account that you control.

Find a stock with an options market, but low trading volume. For example: [Sigma Labs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SGLB/). Current price $3, average volume 500,000. It has a call option at $5.

Buy up as many of those $5 call options as you can, all expiring on the same day. Buy some of the further out ones too. As many call options as you can get without massively distorting the market. You can buy them gradually over a long period, just as long as they're all the same expiration.

Then, on the day they expire, start buying the stock like crazy. Buy buy buy. Place a massive market order, all at once. You're not trying to get good fills, you're just trying to drive the stock price up as much as possible, right before trading closes. Now all your options are deep in the money- sell them for a profit. You could even go short the calls, to get rid of some of your stock. Sell the stock gradually over the next few months to get rid of it (or keep it if you want I guess). You'll probably lose money on the stock itself, but make a killing on the options trade.

I don't have a solid calculation of the numbers of this though. How much would the price of a stock move if you suddenly dumped, say, twice the average daily volume into it, all at once?",439,"People don't seem to be discussing this seriously, which is disappointing.

What you're describing can happen, but likely not to the extent that you're imagining. Since this stock (and presumably the options) have such low volume, the manipulator, here, is going to be driving up these prices as they buy them and driving down the prices as they sell them (i.e., slippage).

At first, the options they buy will be fair value, but as they buy them, the price will go up, and at a certain point, the price will be too high for them to make a profit (this assumes they can actually find enough people to write the options for them, which is certainly not guaranteed).

Now they have these options, and on expiration day they drive up the price of the stock. They execute their calls and receive the shares. All they have to do is sell the shares at this inflated price to make their profit. Except they're the ones that drove up the price in the first place, so as they sell, the price quickly crashes back to its fair value, less then strikes they bought them at in the first place (or they can't find any buyers and up with a bunch of shares).

Between these effects, this plan won't go as smoothly as you might think. In fact, slippage is a serious problem when you have a ton of capital, and hedge funds have to account for this in their strategies. Of course, that isn't to say that you can't make money doing this, it's just not as easy (or lucrative) as you'd think when assuming no slippage. It can also be really risky, especially considering the situations that have occurred with the ~~meme stocks~~ pump n' dump schemes this year.","instead of laughing and mocking at him, you assholes should respectfully answer and encourage his questions.

It's not like the market can't see what the rich guy is doing. High dollar volume orders get additional scrutiny as well, even from an institutional trading desk.

But yeah, someone with a big bag of money can move the market on a low price, low volume stock for sure. There are checks/balances in place to make sure that's done in an orderly way so that the market can respond, but I don't believe those checks/balances are meant to stop someone from doing it."

stock market prices,options,What I Learned From Citadel’s Training Software,"## Introduction

When I was a Finance undergrad, one of the classes I most looked forward to was *Financial Trading Strategies.* While other classes were academic with textbooks and PowerPoint slides, our professor was a former market maker who taught us through hands-on experience. Throughout that semester, our professor gave us — using the same software Citadel uses to train their traders — simulated trading “cases.” Each case taught us to trade from the perspective of a different market participant. Our grades didn’t just depend on how much money we made, but on the PnL compared to our classmates! At the time, the stakes seemed higher than trading with real money.

Here are some things I learned during that semester.

## Isolate your exposures and hedge whenever possible.

### The Stat Arb Case

In the stat arb case, we were commodity traders trying to run a “location arbitrage” strategy. We could buy oil in cheaper locations and transport it to places where oil was more expensive. The market was compensating us for providing supply in markets with too much demand for oil and providing demand in places with too much supply. However, we couldn’t hedge our positions, so our risk was that oil prices worldwide would fall before we could offload our inventory.

This case emphasized the importance of hedging. Even though every trade I made had a positive expected value, many of my trades were losers when oil prices fell. I lost money because I wasn’t just trading the relative prices between locations, but I also had unhedged exposure to the global oil market.

### The Portfolio Management Case

In the portfolio management case, we were PMs managing a portfolio of 3 stocks. Our edge was that we knew the fair value of each of them (in real life, firms might have a team of analysts studying each stock and not giving CNBC interviews). Our job was to take long positions in undervalued or short overvalued stocks. However, our risk was that the stocks might move even further from fair value in the short term.

I quickly learned to take opposing positions to limit my risk to the overall market. If I were only long a bunch of stocks, I could sustain heavy losses during market downturns. Similarly, rally would demolish a short-only portfolio. Combining long and short positions made my portfolio more or less neutral to the broader market. Even if there were no overvalued stocks, I made sure to short something – this insulated me from market crashes and allowed me to leverage my long positions in undervalued stocks safely.

In options trading, hedging is even more important. Many options traders who are “wheeling” —selling cash-secured puts and covered calls— have a lot of long equity, short volatility positions and should be hedging their portfolios. Maybe shorting an index to balance out the long equity exposure of all these puts may be a good idea? Delta hedging is also an option. Buying options elsewhere to hedge the short volatility exposure from these wheel positions can also protect your portfolio from drawdowns.

## Size your trades based on your edge.

### The ETF Arbitrage Case

In the ETF arbitrage simulation, we were APs who could create and redeem shares of an ETF. When the price of the ETF was higher than that of the stocks in the ETF, we could buy the stocks and create shares of the (expensive) ETF to sell. Similarly, when the ETF became cheaper than the stocks, we could buy the cheap ETF and break it down into expensive stocks and sell them. The main risk was execution risk; the chance that our algo was broken or it was too slow, executing trades after the arbitrage was already gone.

This trading simulation was reasonably straightforward but taught me one important lesson: when there is an arbitrage (an edge with nearly no risk), we must trade as much as possible before it’s gone. In most simulations, I learned to maintain reasonable position sizes. However, ETF arbitrage was nearly risk-free, provided I wrote the algo correctly. If I didn’t trade aggressively, my classmates would be, and the arbitrage opportunity would disappear.

In the options markets, we should take many trades in small sizes. Systematic trading strategies such as selling weekly or monthly SPY options tend to be profitable over time, but only if the trader is careful with their position sizing.

## Work harder than anyone else.

This should be obvious, but for some reason, it isn’t. Many compete to make money in the markets; my class was no different. The PnL across the various trading simulations determined what your grades were going to be. While we had some trading simulations that we could trade by hand, we could choose to write algorithms to trade for us instead. Having studied each case beforehand, I spent hours outside of class writing python scripts to trade on my behalf. This allowed me to execute trades faster (and more accurately) than my classmates ever could by hand.

### The Liability Trading Case

In a liability trading simulation, we were brokers handling large orders for other institutional clients. Our edge was that, as brokers, we would receive bids for a large amount of stock at a slight premium or be offered large blocks of shares at a discount. However, because these trades were so large, we couldn’t just close our positions immediately. We had to split up our trades into several orders so they wouldn’t push the market around too much. Our risk was the possibility of the stock moving against us while we tried to sell our shares or cover our short positions over time.

Many of my classmates traded this simulation by hand. They would receive an order, use an excel spreadsheet to evaluate each trade, and offload their positions manually. Those who traded by hand needed up to a minute to process trades. As a result, they were exposed to the market for too long, and many trades moved against them. On the other hand, I processed orders in four to five seconds because I was using an algo to trade.

## An edge exists for a reason. It’s always about providing value.

Not a single trading simulation involved technical analysis. In every trading simulation, we had a role and a service to provide. We had a reason our trading strategies were profitable: we provided value in the market.

Liability traders help execute large trades for clients lacking the infrastructure or patience. Market makers provide the best bid and offer, giving traders better prices when they want to enter and exit positions. Portfolio managers can help resolve supply and demand imbalances in the market buying oversupplied, oversold securities. They can also short highly demanded, overvalued stocks. Finally, APs help keep ETF prices in line with stock prices through arbitrage.

Retail traders should be no different. The easiest services we can provide to the market involve risk premiums and price inefficiencies.

Risk premiums involve holding risk that the market tends to compensate traders for. Risk premiums include long equity & fixed-income positions (supplying equity and debt capital) and short options positions (supplying options). Remember that not all risk is created equal; day trading is risky but arguably provides no value to the market.

Trading price inefficiencies generally involve providing liquidity to market participants who might be forced to trade at bad prices. We can get paid by taking the other side of forced trades, which helps our counterparty get a better price. More on this in the next point …

## Not everyone is doing things for the same reason. Trade with people who are forced to.

In real markets, many people are forced to trade at bad prices. Many institutional funds have rules that require them to buy options as a hedge, no matter the price. Some hedge funds sell their lower-quality holdings before their annual reports so they don’t have to explain to investors why they’re bag-holding the latest meme stock. They then repurchase these stocks after their report. If enough hedge funds sell the same stocks at the same time, these stocks temporarily become too cheap.

### The Market Making Case

The market-making simulation was one of the hardest. We provided quotes on three stocks, and our job was to earn money collecting the bid/ask spread. The hard part was keeping the spread; since we were often on the wrong side of trades; a wave of buying would leave us short stock while the market rallied, and a wave of selling would leave us holding the bag. While we collected the spread with every trade, keeping our positions neutral was extremely difficult.

I’m not going to lie. My market-making algorithm was terrible. I would get flooded with orders on one side and be forced to dump my inventory at even worse prices. However, I noticed that everyone was panic buying or dumping stock at the same times I was. So, in my next iteration, I decided to change my strategy. Rather than competing with other MMs for orders, I would wait for a wave of buy orders and join them. These orders, alongside my own, caused my classmates’ algorithms to shift their prices higher and higher as they desperately attempted to cover their short positions. I would then helpfully sell them my stock at inflated prices. Sometimes, I would see a wave of sell orders and short the stock, knowing I could buy back it at a discount as the other market makers tried to dump their inventory.

Did I end up successfully building a market-making program? Unfortunately, no. But I made a lot of money.

The reason is exactly that: SPY has no events so thus when you make a poor trade, say you buy a long option for too much or sell a short option for too little, these events can right-size for you through IV changes. This doesn't happen with SPY.

I am not saying don't do it but don't think it's the silver bullet to avoiding these issues. It isn't. It's almost a catalyst for the inverse; it's a far more stable roller coaster but with far less opportunity for when you're wrong to work out in your favor."
trade,options,The Genius Behind Nany Pelosi's Trades,"One of the greatest traders of our time - Nancy Pelosi. Joking aside, I was looking through her recent trades and couldn't help but notice how well structured they are. Her choices for the longs are very similar to how I set up my diagonals.

* She's using long calls as a surrogate long stock position to take advantage of the leverage afforded by options. For example, the GOOG trade cost around $940K for her to put on. A similar stock trade would've been around $2.9MM.
* She uses two different long call strategies, based on her disposition towards the stock.
   * For more developed equities like GOOG, MU, DIS, she selected slightly shorter term expirations but went further ITM. This allows the trade to behave more like long stock while decreasing the impact of theta decay on the options.
   * For more growth oriented equities like RBLX and CRM, she selected LEAP expirations and chose strikes closer to the money (although, still ITM). This offers more growth opportunity in the options if directionally correct, while still limiting the impact of theta decay on the longs.
* She selected all established products with promising lines of business going forward. DIS surprised me a little bit, but since COVID they've been pivoting more and more to telecomm so I can understand her thought process the.
* The choices she made are not the cheapest method to gain exposure, however, these are well structured trades. Diamond hands Pelosi at it again.

EDITS for all the keyboard warriors:  
\-I'm not suggesting that Pelosi is actually any kind of great trader - the post is generally satire. The focus is more on the construction of the trades.  
\-The post isn't about how she selects the products, if there's insider trading, etc.   
\-To clarify, Nancy's husband makes most of the trades and she is required to report them. I have absolutely no idea who is actually structuring the trades, if they have an advisor, etc. Again, calling her the great trader is more of a joke than anything.

trade,options,Re-visiting My /NG Trade,"     /NGK23 - Natural Gas Futures 

Recently sold to open a Natural Gas put due to the steep decline. It has been in its own way for around 70 days or so. NG prices are significantly down relative to the spike we had in 2022 around 10. The low is marginally below 2, it has rallied 50% from lows, and I still believe it will make higher lows.

* I wanted to revisit my original post to give more clarification about why I chose to trade /NG, despite the often tail risk in this commodity (to the upside and downside). I will show the **pros and cons to this trade and management potential throughout the post.**

&#x200B;

    The Trade

SELL -1 /NGK23 1/10000 MAY 23 (Financial) /LNEK23 **1 PUT** for .008 LMT credit ($80 credit)

    Important Weighing Data

This is a significantly high probability trade using past data with a lot of room for management and rolling.

    Max profit: 80
    Max loss: (9,920)
    Initial SPAN margin: (567)
    Delta: 0.01 / BWD: 0.46
    POP: >99.5%
    ROC: 14.11%
    IVR: 38
    % drop to strike: -67% in 51 DTE

Hypothetically if the strike were to **ATM** tomorrow, this is a round about (loose) way to see risk

    ~ (3,200) unrealized loss
    ~ (5,400) margin increase

ToS can show Vol adj. if you would want to calculate that into the unrealized loss and margin requirements. In general, there would extremely unlikely chance that the 1 PUT strike goes ITM in 51 DTE. Next part will show more of the pros and cons, as far as charts go.

I placed a white line close to where the 1 PUT is. It .20 cents above the strike because I couldn't zoom out more; it's mainly to show far out the strike is relative to 27+ years of Natural Gas.

[This is graph of the option contract, one of the relative cons so to speak](https://preview.redd.it/tnq2dy83jyla1.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8a8f17575934e71429ac7ccfb1e596c0e9da00b)

2 weeks the option was trading at .034 credit ($340). If there is a pullback and depending on my portfolio, I will add another contract if it upticks close or above 22 Feb's high.

I will continue to roll out, up or down, if the IV environment stays somewhat bid and my sentiment is similar. Though I've been burnt on Nat Gas products, I do like it as a different asset relative to the market index, which is where most of my risk is towards.

    Disclaimer

Definitely not recommending this to beginners or traders who don't have tools on their brokerage trading account to analyze risk. Commodities are a completely different beast. Commodities, generally, have more volatility and entail more tail risk. I can completely afford if /NG goes to 0. I mainly wanted to re-update my old post to further reflect my thought process as I did a poor job originally.",5,[deleted],I just closed my short puts during this recent run up and am hoping to re-enter if we get closer to 2.5 again.,"I think everything is explained correctly, but I'm not following why you would want to put on this trade. 

  
So to summarize, on one June nymex HH contract, you're collecting $80 up front with the dollar risk of if the price goes to the ATM strike of $1 next day, you'd have an estimated risk and margin increase of what you listed, total ($8600) which I agree would be unlikely. There is also the assignment risk if the option expires in the money then you'd be obligated to purchase 10,000 mmbtus, so $10k needed in margin or cash. Actual capital required (buying power) is about $567 so RoC of about 14% on this singular trade, max loss of $9920 if the gas contract goes to zero, which again, I'd agree would be quite unlikely.

  
While your risk-reward on collateral is fine at 14%, your risk-reward on the prices falling between current to strike price, let alone max risk, is terrible. The actual max return plummets to probably below 5% depending on how much margin you have to lock up. You have some comfort that if your put gets assigned at below $1, you'd be long 10,000 mmbtus of gas which is not bad.  
The risk-reward ratio is just not worth it on those numbers. There are definitely better ways to add delta to your portfolio or short vol. Or find a different strike with more extrinsic and hedge with a long put.

In conclusion, squeezing out $80 (.8 cents per contract) over 90 DTE is not the best position to be holding. I mean you definitely can, and I would think if you're willing to put up $100-$1000s of margin if prices drop below this level, you can probably get all that premium. But seeing how you haven't listed out the gas fundamental outlook for this spring, this is at least a moderate risk, extremely low reward sort of trade. I would advise just leaving this alone. 

Now if prices drop 50% from here back to $2 or less, then this would be a different discussion and this sort of trade would be more interesting to put on then."

Thank you in advance for your advice.",1,"One of the guidelines for trading options is to use liquid tickers and options.  These tickers will tend to enable fast fills for better prices due to the higher volume of options being traded.

Illiquid options have the risk of not filling, or filling for a worse price due to the often wide Bid-Ask.  These can also be difficult to close since so few trade them.  These low liquidity tickers and options should be cautiously considered because of these risks.  It is always advantageous to trade higher liquidity tickers and options.

Low volume tickers will have a limited option chain and strikes, which is the case for RES as it is a very low volume ticker.

First of all, congrats on going to an HS that had a personal finance class. That's extremely rare despite the desperate need to address financial illiteracy. I participated in a similar contest in HS, but it was in my *science* class, because my science teacher happened to be a resource simulations nerd, like Civilization and Age of Empires video games.

In any case, contests like that are very common teaching practice that, IMO, is an excellent way to teach the wrong financial lessons, as it gamifies risk-taking. Students who were never exposed to those kinds of contests will have fewer bad habits to unlearn.

Find a loophole in the rules and exploit it (like a hedge fund might), or commit outright fraud (like FTX). If we're going to teach bad financial habits to teens, we might as well go all the way. Why stop at half measures?

For example, in my class, I found a loophole in the way the teacher was simulating bonds and resource management. Students started with random resources, random widgets to build that required resources they might not have, and cash. You could also trade sim stocks or sim bonds. I realized that the rate of return on the bonds was enough to beat any of the other investments or revenue from selling widgets in just one week (bonds matured daily and I could reinvest total proceeds daily, so the magic of compounding), so I went to every student that needed the resources I had and swapped them for cash, then YOLO'd all that cash into bonds. I won by a huge margin with almost zero risk and producing zero widgets (GDP was zero). Just like a hedge fund!","Put it all on slightly otm weeklies on whatever volatile stock you want. The goal of this exercise is to increase variance, even if the teacher doesn't realize it.

For example, if you can bet it all on an even odds coin flip, you approach winning the game half the time. In a class of 30 that's fantastic. As other smart people realize this is the game you have to put in all on worse odds with a higher payout. The more people in the competition, the higher variance you want.","We had the same, except we waited for a month. I 11x my money, ngl I was pretty proud

**Data**

Reddit’s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20.

The summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/olsk3rzidbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c47c6be534d65f806fab70470f13713b59a34fd)

**Analysis**

Ahh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.

So what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \[2\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.

Considering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a. One Week

b. One Month

c. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)

The benchmark for comparison is SPY\[3\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.

**Results**

Before we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**

https://reddit.com/link/qlsbb9/video/n6jlnnvldbx71/player

 *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/)

We would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \[4\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[5\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays).

So, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bfkgenaodbx71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14db831e6397c79913bfe18e9d4db5958b65347)

Would you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.

But keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ye4hbj8pdbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=90e5171c0279ba9428d889dd46d8a0bbab33da15)

GME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \[6\].

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.

https://preview.redd.it/faw73z8qdbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e01686c9740202b0a86f0c7e7bbd0a9d4d193d8

Unsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3tu6gfqrdbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3923e9917d26c772af234ce7c31a32882a2ca5)

For every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.

But what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?

https://preview.redd.it/n95yi6lsdbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f795b4404f8277bad99a57624f158a6a0594d7b0

Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \[7\].

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it’s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.
* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.
* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works — stay tuned!

**Conclusion**

Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with

>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!

I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***

Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).

Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.

\[2\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.

\[3\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.

\[4\] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.

\[5\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

\[6\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns is [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).

\[7\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*",1134,"> Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter 

No, it's not either. That's the answer. Same with stocktwits. Chatter rises with a stock's movement. 

WSB isn't useless tho, there have been scientific papers/reports written that show that DD on the sub does predict stocks going up. But the quality of DD rapidly declined after the GME thing.","The overperformance makes sense to me due to the fact that these tickers become popular when they move a ton.  DFVs original post on GME was buried, it wasn't until the stock started rocketing that the ticker chatter blew up.  A lot of WSBers don't pay attention to the actual DD there and just buy the top and sell the bottom.  I'm on the retroactive prophecy side.  

That being said, really cool study and it is interesting that youd beat the market if you were to follow the plays there early enough.","there are kids in there who have no idea what they are getting into and losing boat load of money....rarely you ll see couple of people posting massive gains but most are losing big time. have seen guys asking, how to sell options after throwing like 10k on OTMs."
trading strategy,options,My most profitable options trading strategy: 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condors,"In April I started trading the 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condor strategy. This has so far been my profitable strategy.

Since a new year has started, I have summed up my results from this strategy after 112 trading days and 588 individual trades.

Using an average buying power of up to 12.000 - 15.000 dollars I have made 9052 dollars on this strategy during these nine months.  For me that is a fantastic return, at least compared to other strategies I have tried. It is also less stressful than other 0DTE strategies as you rarely experience days with big losses.

Here is the essence of the strategy:

I sell Iron Condors on SPX with the delta on the shorts between 5 and 15. The distance to the longs are from 15 to 30 points on SPX.  I try to collect the same premium on both sides.

Immediately afterward I enter stop losses for each side for just a little more than the total premium collected for the Iron Condor.  Since usually only the stop loss on one side is hit, this means that the losses are kept at a minimum, hence the name ""Breakeven"".

The tight stop loss of course leads to more losses. Of my 588 trades 59 % have been losers and 41 % have been winners. But since the average winner is 2,45 times larger than the average loser, the strategy has a positive expectancy.

There are of course risks - the biggest being double stop losses. That happened in 3 % of my trades so far. Another risk, as with any 0DTE strategy, is bad stop loss fills.

From my perspective, the most positive with the strategy is that losses are kept so small. But to achieve this, stop losses are an absolute must.

If you are interested in learning more, I have done a detailed write-up of how I trade 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condors on my web page.

trading strategy,options,Painfully simple trading strategies that you had success with,"What’s the simplest trading strategy you used that in hindsight was either really dumb or just lucky that worked for any prolonged period of time? 

Mine was jumping on the ripper 5 mins out of the gate on any of the FAANG or big tech names during the spring last year. Somehow this worked for like 4 straight months at a pretty decent rate and I grew my account by almost 150%. I’d check futures, see if we were up or down going into the open, look at how the foreign markets closed out, look at the big names and see if anything had gapped, and hone in on the largest overnight movers in that tech or large cap sphere. Using Robinhood charts and really zero technical analysis aside from a pretty elementary understand of candlesticks, I’d read just half of the first 10m candle, and if it pushed hard (which everything does right at open) I would jump in at the cheapest OTM contract that fit my normal position size. Would normally get a continuation up until like 945, a slight pull back, then continue up until the real reversal sometime around 1015-1020. I’d usually punch out right at the first sign of reversal around 1015, which meant the first long wick candle I saw I’d bail out. Ended up leaving a lot of meat on the bone on multiple occasions and I’d check back around noon to see the contract up like another 30-40%, but the goal was to lock in profit in a short time and get back to the day job. 

Kind of comical how well it worked and how much beginners luck it was, but then again expectations were basically zero so the whole mental side of it never got in the way. Kind of fascinating to think about that too and how my own ignorance was a blessing to that style. I’ve tried to go back and do it a few times seeing if I can reignite that but I honestly get in my own way with it. I now “know” too much (or think I do, which I clearly do not) and either get spooked in one way or just get overwhelmed with all the different info and make the wrong choice. 

Either way, would love to hear some other stupidly simple strategies that worked at some point.",828,"Buy super cheap way OTM Microsoft options, like 60 days out, wait until the price went up, then drop them. I was averaging 10% a month when I first started with options with that.

Buy Friday, sell Monday.
Edit: don't let the cat out of the bag though guys or we'll have to start buying Monday and selling Friday"
trading strategy,options,This has been my most profitable 0DTE options trading strategy,"For 16 months the 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condor has been my most profitable options strategy. In fact only one month (January 2022) ended with a loss.

Many have asked how the strategy did in the turbulent first half of 2022, so I decided to do a new write-up. You find the article here: [https://www.sandvand.net/2022/08/21/learnings-from-0dte-breakeven-iron-condor/](https://www.sandvand.net/2022/08/21/learnings-from-0dte-breakeven-iron-condor/)

The strategy is quite simple: I sell Iron Condors on SPX at 5 - 10 delta at different times of the day.  I set separate stop losses on each of the two spreads equal to the total premium of the IC (typically I add 10 dollars on top of that). Usually I let the Iron Condors expire, but I will also sometimes close them early to lock in some profit. 

This is a very tight stop loss compared to what most people do, and yes it will lead to more losses. Yet, the strategy as such has proven profitable.

Here is the summary after trading this strategy from April 20221 until today:

* I have done 1344 trades (usually I do 5-7 trades per day)
* The win rate has been 38,3 %, and the loss rate 61,7 %. This has stayed very consistent during this period.
* All trades are with one contract only - and I will never commit more than 15.000 USD in buying power, which means that I will have a maximum of 5 trades on simultaneously (but usually less)
* I have made 16.814 dollars on the strategy so far. For the one-year period of August 2021 to July 2022 I made 12.681, which is 84,5 % of my max buying power committed to the strategy.
* The average win (99 dollars) is 2,4 times as high as the average loss (41 dollars) - hence the positive expectancy despite most trades being losses.
* The biggest risk to the strategy is double stop losses. This has happened in 3,8 % of my trades. This percentage has stayed quite consistent as well during the whole period.

This is not the only 0DTE strategy I do on SPX. But I like that I rarely have days with big losses. It fits my trading style and risk willingness. 

Hope you find it interesting.",419,"I was shocked at the low win rate and high profit. I guess I don't understand how you are managing the stops. What I thought you meant is each wing stops at the full credit of the entire IC **plus $10**. So if max expiration profit of the IC is $100, you stop either wing at a loss of $110 or less.

I don't see how such a strategy produces those average gain/loss numbers with that win rate, so I must be misunderstanding something.",What platform are you using?,"There are many people using SPY/SPX options as ""warranty against a big market swing"", then on the other side are traders who have statistically slight profit for selling such ""warranty"" to these people.

trading strategy,options,Most leveraged option trading strategy for a strategy,"Hi folks,

I have developed a long strategy with 70% win rate. The strategy is aimed for being a profit/loss in 3 weeks.The price traget is like 10 usd above from current price.

Ex.If spot price of NVDA is 450USD my strategy predicts with 70% accuracy if price of NVDA will reach 460 USD over the next 3 weeks timeframe.

The challenge with this strategy is that we dont know when NVDA  would reach that price target in the 3 week timeframe i.e NVDA could reach PT hypothetically tomorrow or may be at the end of second week.I havent found a single strategy that could cover both these scenarios Ex. Short dated options provide maximum leverage if say NVDA reached the price traget in 1-2 day  but a calendar spread (3/4 weeks) could give good return if say the price reached the target in 3 weeks.I am not considering butterfly as it only gains value around option expiry and around the short strike levels.

My question is , could there be any strategy that could give like 100+% return for price target  being reached in a short time frame or price target being reached in a little longer time ex.2 weeks

NB.I have already played around with optionstrat and still could not find anything solid

Edit1.I may not have been clear when I say return I mean 100%return on risk.This is different from return on my opening cost

Edit2.The reason for 100% return is to have a positive expectancy for the strategy.Tjeoretivally even a 60% return would give me 12% return on average.However I need to aim higher to account for  market turmoils that could break all strategies

Thanks in Advance",1,"Yes it’s called long atm calls. Don’t overthink it, if you have 70% odds then bet according to Kelly criterion and remember to post your loss porn.",If anyone knows that strategy then that person is multi billionaire or even first individual trillionaire.

You either have inside information, and if you trade on it you are committing a crime, or you are just pure speculating.

No such thing as a guaranteed profit.","Assuming you’re talking long straddles here. How do you know that the stock will guaranteed move by a large margin? What do you do if it moves massively in after hours and then at morning open it’s neutral?

After earnings, volatility usually collapses which tanks down the options prices.","Until you get IV crushed. You should paper trade strategies first.

trading strategy,options,Summary of Carter's Trading Strategy From TastyTrade Rising Star Interview,"Greetings, Traders.

Tom Sosnoff of TastyTrade [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNAZHFdkC14) a young trader named Carter in a live stream from Thu 1 Dec 2022. If you don't want to watch the interview, here's a summary of his strategy.

**Trader**

Carter Dobbelmann, a 20-year-old from San Jose, CA.

**Claim to Fame**

Turned $500 into $30,000 within 1.5 years.

**Affiliations:**

* He's on ""Hourglass Trader."" (Google it.)
* He has replied to comments on the TastyTrade video.

**Strategy**: Selling Volatility

* Exclusively trades options.
* Roughly follows what TastyTrade recommends.¹
* Initially, gambled with six significantly OTM *Long Calls* on TSLA, to go from $500 to $7,000 without knowing anything about the stock market, options, or trading and getting extremely lucky. Then, gambled $7,000 on AMZN calls and blew away $6,000 to drop down to $1,000. After learning a more reasonable way of trading, he looks for high-IV underlyings and:

1. Shorts puts for a credit;
2. Shorts call spreads for a credit; and
3. Shorts put spreads for a credit.

* Because he sells high volatility, he's always looking at IV rank.

**Tactics**

* Trades with the trend of the underlying using vertical spreads.
* Runs *Short Call Spreads* when a stock breaks down, and *Short Puts Spreads* when it rallies.
* If he sees evidence that an active play is reversing, he'll add the opposite spread type from what he initially did. If he shorted a call spread, he'd short a put spread. Or if he shorted a put spread, he'd short a call spread.

**Trade Parameters**

* Sets OTM striking prices, going a little above or below the *expected move*² based on ±1∙ σ and TA.
* Uses DTE = \[7, 30\] days (usually not more than 25 days) on individual companies.
* Uses DTE = \[20, 30\] on SPX.

**Underlyings**

* Is indifferent to the underlying.
* Says he plays indexes, e.g. SPX.
* Initially, he traded CLOV and AMC.
* He recently played SI and GME.

**Trading Activity**

* He places 10 to 15 trades per day.
* He maintains a portfolio of fifteen concurrent positions with many different underlyings.
* With a $30,000 account, he's likely risking $2,000 on each position.

**Profit-Taking**

* He exits whenever he captures 25% to 50% of the maximum theoretical profit, usually closer to the latter.
* Because he uses distributed expirations (e.g. DTE = 7, 14, 20 days), he takes profits virtually every day.

**Risk Management**

* If he ran a *Short Call Spread* and the underlying kept moving up, he'd roll the spread up and widen the striking prices.
* This implies that if he ran a *Short Put Spread* and the underlying keeps moving down, he'd roll the spread down and widen the striking prices.
* He doesn't hold beyond the point of capturing 50% of the maximal theoretical profit to try to minimize risk.
* He manages risk very actively and aggressively.

**Unknown or Unanswered Questions**

* How he builds a watchlist.
* What time(s) of day he typically enters/exits trades.
* Quantity of each trade type.
* Scaling strategy.
* Underlying selection criteria.
* DTE criteria.
* Trigger(s) to roll a trade.
* Trigger(s) to exit a trade.
* Spread width.
* Average number of distinct underlyings in his portfolio.
* Win rate.
* Average profit per trade.

**My Thoughts**

This gives us an outline of what he's doing, but the Devil is in the details, and a lot is missing. Without knowing what IV rank threshold (and other criteria) he's using for scanning for underlyings, the spread width, what decision-making criteria he uses to trigger a roll, etc., we just don't have enough information to be able to try to replicate this.

We also don't know anything about how he's making decisions about where the market is likely to go, overall. Trading during the week of Mon 5 Dec 2022 might be dangerous because more macroeconomic data is being released. On Tue 13 Dec, the CPI will be released. The following day, the Fed will announce its interest rate decision at 2:00 pm ET, followed half an hour later by The JPow's press conference. It would be imprudent to try to trade oblivious to these important macroeconomic catalysts.

This interview is interesting, but ultimately leaves us guessing. Without additional information and a comprehensive list of trades over a three-month period, so that we could look at the transaction times and replay the price action to understand the decision-making, I think that it's impossible to truly figure out what a trader is doing and whether it could have a sustainable edge. What would help the most is an Excel spreadsheet containing every trade's transaction time, action, and a justification for that action. It's impossible to reverse-engineer what we've heard in just the interview well enough to put it to the test.

We can reduce the unknowns by just focusing on SPX. If someone can track Carter down, it would be interesting to get him to fill in the blanks. We really need to understand how he minimizes losses from positions that go against him. To manage risk ""aggressively,"" what triggers him to roll a position, and how soon in the life cycle of a trade that's in trouble does he do this?

Artem",200,Time will tell. A few months is not a very long history. /Sample size.,"Thanks for the excellent summary.

If there are any newbies reading this threat and licking their lips, and hoping for similar returns, pls be very careful. 

I sense that for every 1 Carter, then must be 20 others who tried the same strategy but blew their account. But we never hear of them.

Carter basically sold credit spreads, and given his 6000% return in 1.5 years, he's obviously taking a ton of risk on each trade.

Going forward, he may find his returns are not so good, cos his account is now larger and his emotions will change when he's playing with much larger amounts on the line. Its easier to double $500 than it is to double $30k.","Bullshit story. Nobody turned $500 into $30,000 from ""selling volatility"". 

The story would have been believable if the kid had $50,000+ and turned it into more from selling options...but this story is so absurd that it can be dismissed outright.

The only people turning $500 into tens of thousands of dollars are degenerates like me who buy short dated options and ride gamma and vega to Valhalla.

I sell options too but selling options is the classic ""takes money to make money"" story and it's slow and steady. Selling options will never deliver outsized gains.

Great summary breakdown! I just hate bullshit artists with bullshit stories... especially when they aren't even believable to anyone except the most gullible or inexperienced.

Take TastyTrade with a heaping amount of salt too. They do stuff like this to sell their tastyworks platform and ""options selling is for everyone"" narrative."
trading strategy,options,Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 12 - Monetizing the Level of Implied Volatility (Big Brain Trading Strategy),"# I've found huge edges by trading how the level of implied volatility changes. This post explains how. 

# Example: I sold some of the January straddles on RIVN when they released options this week at around 150% IV. It's now at 129%. 

[Bloomberg Terminal Screenshot for RIVN volatility yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/osvt3tdme6081.png?width=2118&format=png&auto=webp&s=5134b4a0be47b031421957363281f3b2b2a71516)

*I was able to capture* *21 Vegas in 1 day!*

This could have gone the other way, but a lot of work went into pricing the fair value of IV here (actually have it much lower than where it is now), and in this lesson I will go into how to think about trading implied volatility levels and price it out for yourself.

# Most traders only think about trading implied volatility VS realized volatility.

Or what we might refer to as ""theta gang"" strategies. But there is a whole world of opportunity out there to be explored by trading *how the actual implied volatility number* changes for options.

# This post will go in depth on how to trade the level of implied volatility and how the PnL for it works.

The reason I bring this up is that I have spent some time looking into mispriced options in longer dated options and I think there is lots of edge to be found there. But in order to take advantage of this, we need to understand how to price and trade the level of implied volatility.

**Note: these are advanced trades. There's good returns to be made. But it can be absolutely brutal if you are on the wrong side. Having a strong thesis and good position management are a must.**

# Its all about that vega, baby!

Trading is all about finding where you disagree with the market and then expressing your view on that disagreement correctly.

If we are going to be trading the level of implied volatility, we need to make sure we are *exposed* to change in the level of implied volatility.

Options off the bat are sensitive to this, through one of the greeks called vega. Vega is the change in the option price for a 1 point change in implied volatility.

For example, if *implied volatility went from 40% to 41%, vega tells us how that would impact the price of the option we are looking at*. If our vega was ""1000"" the position would change in value by $1,000.

# What options are most sensitive to vega?

The primary way to get a lot of vega exposure, is to go further out in time.

When go very far out in time, you have very little gamma, and therefore very little theta. the primary exposure is vega, which creates a somewhat linear trade.

# For example: here is the greeks for a Jan 2024 straddle on SPY:

&#x200B;

[Short JAN 2024 straddle. Look at our greeks!](https://preview.redd.it/61v0b3gpc6081.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2cd40e74f46407bf73c843c944cb095f2baf8ec)

As you can see, we have *very little sensitivity*  to delta, gamma, theta. But an unbelievably bigger sensitivity to vega! This is why we consider these to be ""linear"" trades for the most part: The PnL really moves up or down with changes in implied volatility. 

What about nearer dated options?  Let's take a look at a straddle on SPY that expires this week. 

&#x200B;

[Short SPY November 17 2021 Straddle. Looks different huh?](https://preview.redd.it/2lqybubad6081.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a3881978c9cdf335428bb38a542ce52f133f85)

When we reduce the time to expiration, vega is much less impactful. As you can see, when we are expiring soon, gamma and theta run the show primarily!

In either situation, if implied volatility goes up, you are going to make your vega , if implied volatility goes down, you are going to lose your vega . So when trying to monetize implied volatility dislocations, looking further out in time is a good idea.

# A slightly gruesome analogy to understand vega vs theta trading

Imagine a person who finds out that they have 1 day to live. They are going to expire in one day. What happens in that one day before expiry means a lot to them. If they have a bad day, it would be devastating, and good day would be euphoric.

It makes sense, they need to maximize on today. The outcome of this day is definitive of the quality of their life.

Now imagine another person who has 80 years left to live.

All of a sudden what happens today isn't such a big deal. There's lots of days left, so if today was mediocre.. it's not the end of the world. So what does this person focus on? Whats really important to how they feel and the trajectory of their life? *It's their outlook on their future and what they see for down the road.*

# Just like the person with 1 day to live, shorter dated options are really sensitive to things that happen today. A lot of theta, a lot of gamma.

On further dated options, just like the person with 80 years left to live, it's more so the outlook on the future that matters. If your option expires in 2 years, it's ok for the most part if the stock moves above it's average daily move today.  But if all of a sudden the future of the business goes from stable to uncertain, the value of your options will change drastically. The reason it will change drastically is because there's lots of vega, or exposure to a change implied volatility.

There is money to be made where the level of implied volatility is different than what we think it should be.

# Is there money to be made trading the longer dated options?

A lot of people think you cant make a lot of money trading longer dated options. So people will maybe buy leaps, and sell covered calls against them since the leap is not very sensitive to volatility. But as I hope you are starting to see, this can not be further from the truth!

**For example, let's take a look at a trade that was shared with me on ARKX.**

When it became option-able this year, a friend of mine shared some research on the longer dated options that was really interesting. The 1 year options were trading at 40% implied volatility, and our conclusion was that they were worth 25% implied volatility.  over the next couple months, it came all the way down. a 15 point drop in implied volatility.

&#x200B;

[IV literally got crushed.](https://preview.redd.it/09cwwd87i6081.png?width=2446&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb33e6c735acf2ad1cdfa7a255de69c76c116c6)

So the question is, how profitable was the trade?

Here is what the position looked like at inception. Take a look at our greeks. **As you can see..**

&#x200B;

[Sold for $4.825 \/ lot](https://preview.redd.it/4baz43woi6081.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b4e7534fa4c4f7cd05f61f727e22aa4ab9328c)

Here's what it looked like at the end.

&#x200B;

[Bought back for $2.99 \/ lot!](https://preview.redd.it/gz84yltti6081.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=57f26bfd75e2638941a600d8c635d8e9330d6b05)

# The options basically got cut in half!

Because of the nature of this trade and the confidence in the research, myself and the others I know in this position were able to scale up pretty big. 

&#x200B;

[this was in late June](https://preview.redd.it/i77akldbj6081.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ff5b27cd0f36ef74dba1ab2615f6ad7492108f9)

# What was really interesting is how wrong the market's pricing was.

As we go further out in time, there tends to be less liquidity on some of these names when you go further out. There's just less eyes on it. That means opportunity.

For example, on RIVN, myself and the others I was looking at this trade with basically made up all of the longer dated volume early on Tuesday. 

Because of how poorly it was being priced, and the thoroughness of the research we did, I was able to scale up on this position significantly. I've found that there's actually a lot of opportunity like ARKX that comes around. So now let's discuss a couple of basic ways to price these out and find these opportunities.

# Idea generation

Something that I've noticed is when realized volatility spikes in the near term, sometimes the whole term structure will elevate and the back can get really out of line.

So i typically look for these types of trades when bad news has come out around a stock, industry or sector.

**Examples of times that I have traded this way:**

* When Archegos blew up. Longer dated vols on the companies that were held by the fund stayed elevated post event.
* ARKX release. Options were pretty illiquid and very poorly priced. Anticipating a lot more volatility than it should have given the underlying stocks
* TSLA longer dated options were being priced at extremely high levels given the size of the company and relative to correlated assets
* KWEB pricing in extremely high volatility (higher than covid) because of Chinese market issues.
* RIVN starting to release options and pricing them at insane levels of implied volatility.

# How to price the level of implied volatility: DISCA example

In order to explain how to go about pricing the level of implied volatility, I am going to go through a trade that I took earlier this year on DISCA.

Keep in mind that this is the sentence we are trying to complete: ***The market is showing me that the stock is trading at an implied volatility of X, I think the level of implied Vol should be Y.***

# The Situation

Earlier this year when the Archegos fund blew up, the stocks that it was holding took a massive hit. Simply put, they got crushed! This lead to a massive opportunity, that was missed by much of the retail community. The options market went berserk. 

Before the fund blew up, the fair value for options were around 55-58% IV. 

But when everything exploded, the crazy movement in the short term caused the whole option chain to lift up!! All of a sudden, the 90 day and 120 day options were trading at 75%-80% IV!

For perspective, IV was at 68% during covid for the same DTE...

Basically, things look really crazy. So I set out to price the options and try to uncover a trade.

# There are two ways to price the options here. Absolute value and relative value. Let's go over each way for DISCA;

# 1) Example of absolute value pricing:

Absolute value pricing involves comparing what we are seeing today for a stock against what we have seen in the past. 

DISCA July options were trading at 55% IV before the Archegos liquidation. As the event happened, Implied volatility shot up to 75%. A couple days later, when the event was over, it was still at 70% IV. 

&#x200B;

[IV stayed elevated even when the event was over. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0alx7m5l6081.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=a356b0eab97e9f3de96f7ce3421bfc421c4d439d)

Thinking about how options are priced, it would make sense that the level of implied volatility came down here since the impact from the event had happened already (assuming there were no further ""chain reactions"") and therefore the level of implied Vol should come back down to what it was Pre-event, or 55%.

The reason I did't think there would be chain reactions is that the realized volatility basically stopped after the event. Check this out:

&#x200B;

[RV went right back to normal after the news!!](https://preview.redd.it/bmp8w036o6081.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=09a7d4c47e449b0eabace186348a14f398f1abf0)

# With a normal implied volatility of 55%, the event over, and RV returning to normal, it seemed reasonable to expect the IV to come back down to the 55% range.

# 2) Example of relative value pricing:

Relative value pricing is an extremely powerful way to price options. It involves comparing the options for a stock we are interested in against other stocks that are correlated. 

For example, KO and PEP are strongly correlated. They have similar levels of implied volatility. Take a look at this pic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b7c35gfcm6081.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b4f5b7a06d5a768201585756a8aaf07ac3b8c0

The above picture is showing : Blue - PEP 90 day IV. Green - KO 90 day IV. Bottom green - Ratio between KO and PEP 90 Day IV.

As you can see, they move together. when KO Vol goes up, so does PEP.

Looking at the ratio, you can see they have an average ratio between them that they mean revert around. This is because they have correlated movements and implied volatilities. When the spread between them gets too large, we see it close. 

Now imagine we saw this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3uiu5teom6081.png?width=2364&format=png&auto=webp&s=95ee9a4c2c05438f7e9691b8097ec0fd7add88bc

The red line is a hypothetical situation where the ratio between them shot up.

In this situation, we could also say that there is an opportunity to trade the level of implied volatility for these companies.

We could buy Vol on the lower iv one, sell Vol on the higher one. OR we could look for which leg is ""inefficient"" and likely to change the most, and just trade that one.

# So how did I use relative value pricing to trade DISCA? 

First, I went out to find a correlated stock. The one I settled on was FOXA. Then I plotted the IVs for each of them and looked at the ratio. 

&#x200B;

[DISCA iv30 \/ FOXA iv30](https://preview.redd.it/p55msy86n6081.png?width=2178&format=png&auto=webp&s=b12d46b411a0ae33660cc93d632b3c60eb846d58)

As you can see, at the time of the disaster, the IV went through the roof. Since FOXA was not a part of the disaster, It was clear that it wasn't really an industry impacting event, and that when the disaster is over, the volatility should return to something back in line with this correlation. 

# With an average ratio of about 1.1-1.2, and FOXA trading at around 45-50% IV. it seemed reasonable that we should see DISCA volatility come back to around 55% - 60% IV.

My analysis on DISCA painted a very clear picture of what should happen to the options after the event. Because I had done enough leg work to develop a good thesis, I was able to pack on some size and make a fantastic return. 

# Both my absolute value and relative value narrowed down on a similar fair value for implied volatility on DISCA, between 55% and 60%!

From here, I went and sold July straddles on DISCA and sure enough, the IV came down to my expected fair value and I was able to pay for a nice vacation :) 

I closed out this position when it was pretty much at my fair value. 

On the flip side, if this trade had gone against me, I would have to go back to the drawing board and really dig into my thesis. Holding these types of positions through IV spikes can be catastrophic if you are wrong, so a lot of work would have to go into *why* it's moving against me. 

On a couple other positions, it has moved against me in the short term but then I have been right in the end of the day. Weathering those storms is no joke though especially if you have a meaningful amount of money on the line. This is why I always stress the importance of knowing your stuff before scaling up your trades.

# Conclusion:

By knowing how to price the level of implied volatility, you can develop really strong ideas that can yield great returns. This has been one of my primary strategies this year, especially with the meme stock craze, tensions in China, etc. 

# IMPORTANT POINT:

This is NOT about just selling high IV. A lot of the times, IV is high for a reason. ***This is about pricing IV, and selling when it is expensive.***

A lot of traders make the mistake of selling because it's high, but I hope this post helps you think different about volatility and gives you some ideas about where you can find a real edge in the market. 

Remember, once you have an idea of where IV *should* be, you can make a trade if it's different than what the market is pricing.

Previous parts of this series: [PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pxe1wj/the_ultimate_guide_to_selling_options/), [PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/py2j8g/ultimate_options_selling_guide_pt_2_detailed/), [PART 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/pzf40t/ultimate_guide_to_selling_options_profitable_part/). <- read these and it will hopefully lay some groundwork for this post.

# It all starts with Idea Generation

This is where I find a lot of people struggle, but it should actually be one of the easiest parts of strategy development. 

For you to have a profitable system, you just need to be better than the next guy. It doesn't need to be super fancy or complicated. 

Think about it like you are an electrician in your local town. Currently, there's some guy making all the money for fixes in the area. If you can find some sort of advantage, now you'll be the guy making all the money. Maybe you can get jobs done faster, maybe you sell better, maybe your price is lower. 

**Note**: an idea alone is worthless. Just like in business, ideas don't make money. Execution is what makes money. 

**Note**: Your idea can't be too general. It can't just be ""I want to sell options"". It needs to be more specific. With that being said, it doesn't need to be something super complex. 

At this point, we are just deciding. on something we want to investigate. 

**Examples of good things to explore:**

* Is the implied variance risk premium higher on ETFs than stocks?
* Where is the variance risk premium the highest across US equities?
* Is selling vol on tech stocks and buying vol on finance a good pairs trade?
* Can we forecast earnings straddle PnLs?

# A trading edge has distinct Characteristics:

Below is a list of different things that can lead to an edge in the market. I share these to spark some ideas so that you can think about where you should look for an edge given your unique situation.

&#x200B;

* **Data access**: do you have access to better data that no one else does. Example: Imagine the number of species in the Marianas Trench could predict tomorrows SPY price. Well, no one has that data. So if you did, you would have more knowledge than everyone else and you'd make the most money. 
* **Skillsets**: If you are competing in a very low capacity space where there is lots of individuals and not so many teams, having strong data science skills (pull in data, manipulate and transform the data)  could give you an edge and help you build your trading business. 
* **Your network**: Do you have access to people who can give you good ideas. Example: private equity deals , having a network of professional traders to collab with, etc. 
* **Specialization**. If you are a corporate lawyer, can you figure out M&A deals better than the next guy? If you work in small cap tech can you figure out software development cycles and product release dates better than the next guy? Are you a doctor who understands biotech better than the next guy?
* **Geography**: You can only trade certain products when you live in certain places. This also incorporates regulatory issues too. 
* **Being first to an idea**: I guess this is the ""reinventing the wheel"" point. This is a pretty competitive route to take but for example when new products are released, no body *really* knows how to price it efficiently so there is room for you to come in and take a stab at pricing it better than the next guy. 
* **Liquidity constraints**: Using your capital size to your advantage. Warren Buffett once said if he had a million dollars he could do 100% a year and that is because he could take the same ideas he uses and use them on lower cap stocks which are less efficiently priced. So where can we go that the big players can't? (Don't try to find food in the ocean, find a pond with lots of small fish). 
* **High Barrier to entry due to infrastructure:** We can't really just go and start a high frequency trading firm. The infrastructure for this is insane, so if you have it, you could have an edge. 
* **Risk tolerance**: Do we have a higher risk tolerance than the next guy, and can therefore take trades  with more PnL variance that others maybe avoid/ can't take. Example: A volatility hedge fund might not want to deploy a strategy with 5% daily swings, even if the expected value is huge. 

Those are some characteristics of a good edge/ idea and hopefully it gives you some ideas. 

**In another post, I will go into my strategy for earnings trading as a follow up example to this**. The reason I am exploring earnings is because there is a lot of retail interest, it's tricky to model well, and there's likely to be a variance risk premium. 

# Building your strategy

# 1) Pick what you are trying to predict/forecast. 

Something really important to note is that whenever you are placing a trade, it is your opinion VS the market. There is somebody on the other side of your trade taking on the opposite view of you. 

Since we are trading our ideas against the market, it means, we are expressing a *disagreement with the markets view on things.* So whether we know it or not, we have some sort of ""forecast or predicting"" on how things *should be priced.* Being conscious about what we are trying to predict is very important. 

For example, if we are trading earnings volatility, what we might be trying to predict is the straddle PnL, and if we can identify when they are cheap/expensive, we can build a strategy. 

What we are trying to predict is referred to as your **target variable.** 

# Not why, but whether.

Once we have an idea or something we want to forecast, we don't want to ask ""why does this exist"". We start by asking ""whether this exists"". 

So many retail traders fall into this trap. They say: ""This sounds like a good idea because of A, B, and C reasons, I'm going to trade it"". 

But we can't ask why it exists until we confirm whether it does. 

This part usually requires some pretty serious data science skills. A workaround for retail is to look at academic papers for ideas, or surround yourself with people who have the skills. 

A good place to research is: [https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/)

# What should we try to predict?

What we try to predict is important. Here's an example to illustrate: 

It's hard to predict the score between West Ham and Manchester United ( an OK team and an all-star team), but it's not so difficult to predict who the winner is likely to be. 

So for our trading, sometimes we don't need to be trying to forecast the *exact move.* We can start by just focusing on *the bias.*

So from a basic perspective, if we are trying to forecast whether a stock has an inflated risk premium in it's options (they are expensive), we can look at some data points that help us predict cheap/expensive, a fair value on volatility, and a reason for it, but then in our execution, we can be less married to our fair value target price and trade the cheap/expensive bias more consistently. 

# 2) Determine the factors that help us with our prediction

Imagine you are trying to predict the amount of horsepower that a car has. In your ""model"", the **target variable** would be Horsepower. But what can help us predict horsepower?

* whether the car is a v6 or v8?
* The colour of the car?
* rear, front or all wheel drive?
* number of doors?

Let's say we determine that the 5 points above are good indicators of a cars horsepower. These would then become our **predictor variables**. 

**You can think of predictor variables as the checklist of things we go over when trying to make a conclusion about our target variable.** 

Example: If a car has a V8 engine, red paint, rear wheel drive, and 2 doors, it's probably over 300HP. 

# Consulting the data

If you want to be able to do this on a professional level, you will need to develop your data science skills. Being able to work with and manipulate data is the equivalent of knowing how to type in the professional space. It's not an edge, but it's basically expected that you know it. 

In the retail space (most of us here), it's a nice to have and not a need to have. So yes, knowing it can be an advantage, but it's not a necessity. 

I will focus on how to do this with no coding background unless enough traders want to see the other part. 

# An example of trading a strategy being implemented

**Note**: A lot of you ask what tools I use. A lot of the base data points and scans that I rely on are from Predicting Alpha. I then use Think or Swim to stress and analyze positions. I execute trades in Interactive Brokers. 

The reason I use these platforms is they a) provide me with analytics tools that ease the burden of needing data science skills b) let me analyze my positions in depth before putting them on c) offer me the best commissions and execution on my trades.

For this strategy I am sharing in this example, I am trading the difference between the implied and realized volatilities for US Equities. Because of the variance risk premium, and increased retail interest I aim to build out a model that helps me identify overpriced options.

# Let's start by defining my Target and Predictor Variables.

1) **Target Variable**: Realized volatility over the next 30 days for a stock

2) **Predictor Variables:** Current realized volatility last 30 days, current implied volatility 30 day, current future forecast of volatility 30 day, Current IV30d/RV30d Spread.

Through my own research and things I've learned, the set of predictor variables I listed above are good at telling me about what realized volatility will look like over next 30 days.

For each of those factors, I am trying to determine if they are high or low relative to the historic metrics (except for the volatility forecast, which is something a bit different, basically a statistical forecast of the future). 

Beyond each of these factors, I will look at the news to add a more qualitative component to my analysis. I want to understand *why* I am seeing what I do. 

# 1) Start with a scan

I started by running a scan for a stock that had some liquidity and an IV30 > Forecast by at least 1.2x. I also added a filter for IV30>45% to get rid of stocks that weren't implying much to happen.

The reason I do this is that the market has way too many things to look at, and it's efficient to use a scanner to filter from 1,000s of equities down to a shortlist of things that meet a ""base criteria"" for your strategy. 

[Filters: stocks price \> 15, average daily option volume \> 3000, IVvsFV \< 1.2x , IV30 \> 45, sorted by IVvsFV.](https://preview.redd.it/g6yp1atzenr71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcfd6b352cb0f410545e016a1c20ad197f5b3f5e)

&#x200B;

By doing so, I generated a list of 16 stocks to look at. Given the time of year, most of these stocks have earnings around 30 days from now, so I had to be careful to avoid ones with big earnings moves priced in since I am really trying to trade the non event volatility. Most of these stocks have a *bit* of earnings vol priced in on the 30dte options.

The stock I chose for this analysis is GRPN (Groupon). 

# 2) Evaluate your predictor Variables

IV30, RV30, and Forecast 30 analysis:

IV30 = 77%

RV30 = 48%

FV30 = 57%

IV30 is over 1.2x FV30. **This is my expensive indicator for the FV30 predictor variable.**

Off the bat, this is looking good. IV much higher than RV and Forecast. This is usually a strong sign for ""sell options"".

To move on, let's plot the historic IV30 and RV30 to see how they are moving relative to each other. 

[historical plot of IV30 and V30, we can see that IV has outpaced RV for the last month](https://preview.redd.it/adfkh4b8fnr71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9900fa2e0710a3eb126cc6233bcebe2658bc2309)

If we plot the historic IV30 and RV30, we can see that for the last while there has been a consistent premium of IV over RV. **This is my expensive indicator for IV30 and RV30**

**One cause for concern:** We can see that IV has continued to rise despite the lower realized volatility, which means that someone is still a buyer at these levels and could be a slight cause for concern. I would definitely want to do somme digging into the company to see what's happening around it and try to hypothesize about who could be buying here. 

One last point we will look at here is if this ratio between IV and RV is normal or if its at an extreme. 

As I described in a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/py2j8g/ultimate_options_selling_guide_pt_2_detailed/): *Think of IV and RV as being in a dance together. They take turns leading the dance, but they try to stay in step with each other.*

So looking at how they move together, we usually see it **mean reverts** around a comfortable spread between the two. If one strays too far from the other, they move closer together. If they move too close together, they push further apart.

# Here is the IV / RV ratio for GRPN over the last year.

[You can see it's move up towards the top of the range. This is because IV has been increasing while RV has stayed relatively low.](https://preview.redd.it/np8fipecfnr71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e72d5049240fdfb88dd32859dba102500d770fa)

As we can see, the IV/RV spread is towards the top of the range. meaning they are far apart right now. So we can expect either RV to pick up, or IV to come down, or them to meet in the middle (there's other combinations of possibilities, but let's keep it simple).

If we look back at the first graph, we see that RV has remained the same while IV has been moving up. So.. I could conclude that perhaps it will meet somewhere in the middle (iv comes down a bit, rv goes up a bit, but below the current IV line!). **This is my expensive indicator for iv/rv ratio predictor variable.**

# If we look at all the variables, they check the boxes for the realized volatility to be lower than the implied. AKA: IV is expensive. 

Now as mentioned there's some qualitative research into the news, sentiment, who's trading this, to really build some qualitative confidence too. But assuming that checks out, I would be selling options here!

# From here, I would put on a trade that properly express my view that volatility is expensive (maybe a straddle). 

I will go more in depth on structuring and managing trades in a later post, it's a whole topic on it's own.

# These are the basics of good strategy development and finding an edge in trading. 

I hope that this post has given you some ideas and insights into the world of profitable trading. It might seem like over kill, but I promise that I do not go out of my way to to make things complicated. We actually want things to be as simple as can be, while still being profitable. 

An important thing to note is that you can actually do all of this work and still lose money trading. It's a tough game. We need to always be improving, looking for new ideas.. always on the hunt for that better edge. 

# If you found this post valuable please upvote it as that gives me ideas about what I should write about in my next post. 

Happy Trading everyone.

\~AG",556,Haven't read your post yet but honestly thank you for these post I will read later,"Am finding that my edge is:

1. Having patient capital. No itch to buy or sell until the right opp comes along
2. Long term horizon. I can hold 5-10 yrs easy.
3. Never borrow on margin. I can stomach correction w zero pressure to sell.","I think you're missing one thing in your list of categories for an edge, which is industry knowledge.  I'm extremely tech-heavy in my portfolio and have been for years, however I've made some huge gains by getting in to companies early on because I work in tech so I know it better than most people.  I know why AWS is winning in the cloud space because I use it every day.  I can usually tell if a tech company is going to be successful long-term based on their products too.  For example, I saw a demo of DDOG's product at a conference before they even went public and I could tell instantly that this thing was pure gold since it could answer questions that I've struggled with solving for the previous 10 years of my career and was even capable of doing something in the Security field (not their intended purpose) that I had only theorized was possible but I knew would be invaluable once everyone else realized this (I pointed it out to the guy doing the demo as well and the use case had never even occurred to him).  I know what brands of CPUs my peers at other similar companies are buying for their high-performance computing clusters and why, plus the drives, networking gizmos, etc, and there's a reason that I'm jacked almost to the tits about AMD going forward along with a few other companies.  Finally, if Hashicorp ever goes public I will YOLO that shit so hard that even WSB will be impressed because their products are some of the best that I've ever used and I think almost everyone in the industry would probably agree with me.  


Now some of this probably falls under ""network"" as you mentioned, since I certainly leverage the opinions of my peers in tech when making some of these decisions.  However, trading companies in an industry that you intimately understand is definitely an edge and has served me well for a very long time.  Sure, there are big firms out there that will do their DD and have quants with decades of experience to actually do it, but even then the quants are going to ask people like me about a company's products and I can guarantee that one of their quants wouldn't be able to look at DDOG and have their eyes light up during their demo because they can finally give me a solution that I've wished I had for the previous 10 years.  I realize that I'm also glossing over things like revenue and how a company is run overall here, and in reality I can still take those things into account to a certain extent.  It's not too hard to look at a smaller tech company and determine if they're going to crash and burn because they can't run a company.  I can't tell if they'll succeed in general, but I can definitely tell if they won't based on how they run their dev process (this seems like it would be difficult to determine but in reality I've found that I can usually make a pretty good guess and I've never been wrong before) so I think that along with the usefulness of their offerings is enough to make a pretty good case in terms of fundamentals."
